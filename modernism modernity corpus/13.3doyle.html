<p id="lead">Early in her novel <i>Jacob's Room</i>, Virginia Woolf makes us privy to a suggestively erotic scene between two men, and in the process she signals her interest in a certain dimension of British history. The title character Jacob Flanders and his friend Will Durrant read Shakespeare and eat lunch together as they sail to the Scilly Isles to visit Durrant's family: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[Timmy Durrant] with a sprout of beard, looking sternly at the stars, then at a compass, would have moved a woman. Jacob, of course, was not a woman. The sight of Timmy Durrant was no sight for him, nothing to set against the sky and worship; far from it. They had quarreled. Why the right way to open a tin of beef, with Shakespeare on board, under conditions of such splendour, should have turned them to sulky schoolboys, none can tell ships have been wrecked here.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although "none can tell" why two young men might become sulky in a scene presided over by Shakespeare (whom Jacob places even above the Greeks, and Richard Dalloway in Woolf's next novel deplores for his sonnets that invite us to peep through keyholes), and although Woolf's narrator doth protest (too much) about the possibility that Jacob could be moved by the sight of Durrant, most twenty-first-century readers would detect the gay codes (as a circle of Woolf's contemporaries undoubtedly did). Woolf more broadly hints at her gay subtext when she has Jacob undress, swim, and bathe "naked" at the very moment when Shakespeare is knocked overboard, "floating merrily away . . . he went under" (<i>JR</i>, 39). The narrator ends her description with 

<b></b>

a vision of "waves breaking unseen by anyone" and the whole bay rising "to heaven in a kind of ecstasy" (ibid.).  </p>

<p>The ecstasy is, however, quickly followed by (post-coital?) sorrow, so that "the cottage smoke droops, [and] has the look of a mourning emblem, a flag floating its caress over a grave" (ibid.). In Greece, the narrator notes, this "sadness would be routed by strangeness and excitement and the nudge of a classical education,"&#x2014;in other words, a community of male intimacy&#x2014;but on the Cornish hills, "the chimneys and the coast-guard stations and the little bays with waves breaking unseen by anyone make one remember the overpowering sorrow." "And what can this sorrow be?" the narrator asks. And then answers: "It comes from the houses on the coast. We start transparent, and then the cloud thickens. All history backs our panes of glass. To escape is vain" (<i>JR</i>, 40). </p>

<p>What is this history that clouds the panes of glass and saddens the swimmer? One answer would of course be the legacy of all manner of gendered cruelty.  </p>

<p>Yet Woolf gives us clues to another, closely related history at the heart of this passage: Atlantic history. It is no coincidence, I will argue, that this is a boat scene, a sea-crossing associated with wrecked ships, the sorrow of which is particularly evoked by coast-guard stations and little bays and waves breaking unseen by anyone&#x2014;which make one "remember" a sad history. Woolf understands that this history is a long, transnational history, full of perilous sea crossings that often entail a sexual crisis or ruin.  </p>

<p>A striking number of English-language modernist writers likewise situate their stories of sexual or gender trouble within a transnational, Atlantic history. Here I will ultimately focus on Nella Larsen and Virginia Woolf as two authors who typify this pattern among a number of English-language modernists&#x2014;such as Rhys, McKay, Stein, Hurston, Forster, and Hemingway, to name a few&#x2014;whom I will call Atlantic modernists and understand as one kind of geomodernist.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  It is by now a commonplace that modernism probes the formation of the social subject, using literary form to expose or rearrange the subject's social coordinates. For these writers, Atlantic and transnational history provides one crucial set of such coordinates, a historical set. Indeed, attention to the Atlantic dimension of their work may allow us to do fuller justice to the historical consciousness of modernist writers, so long decried as being altogether absent. For my purposes here, however, I will emphasize how their fiction asks us to think more historically about transnationalism, especially in relation to its liberatory possibilities for social identity.  </p>

<p>For transnationalism (as a phenomenon, not a field of inquiry) has a long, complicated history. It's nothing new. Attention to its history makes clear that transnationalism has not simply traveled transversely or fugitively across the borders of nationalism. Rather, in Atlantic modernity at least, transnationalism and nationalism have since the seventeenth century arisen together and unfolded dialectically. Their frictions have catalyzed their further instantiations. Some transnational scholarship assumes a sequence in which nations come first and then transnational migrations, economies, and impulses move across and against these national boundaries. This work has usefully tracked the ways that, since the early twentieth century, transnational movements, especially in conjunction with decolonization, have troubled global, top-down centralization by way of border-crossing alliances and identities working "from below" and laterally.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>But historically and economically over the past four centuries, many nations have taken shape exactly by way of such centrifugal migrations, even if, ideologically, nationalist discourses have simultaneously spoken past or against them. On the Atlantic, transnational dispersions (at first, transatlantic proto-national dispersions) created the new circuits of wealth that built the Anglo-European nations, fostered a sense of bold, free movement for those who were not slaves or bondspersons, and at the same time bred fervent, distended, and nostalgiac ties to something that came to be called nationality. This, at least, is what we find in the case of those transnationalisms that began to form in the sixteenth century with Spanish and Portuguese projects on the Atlantic, later extended by the Dutch, French, English, and Germans. As we will see, this history suggests a supplement to Benedict Anderson's account of nationalism. Atlantic transnationalism makes clear that nations are not only formed centripetally around a common language and a print-sphere culture, as Anderson has so richly established.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The nation's "imaginary" centripality and insistence on commonality (even across oceans) arises, at least in part, under centrifugal, transnational pressures&#x2014;economic, political, and psychosocial.  </p>

<p>Such an account also clarifies how Atlantic transnationalisms emerge together with what Walter Mignolo calls the "modern/colonial border."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Mignolo's formulation is useful for the way it moves us even further from positioning modernity as the founding central term&#x2014;as we do even when we speak of Anglo-European modernity arising through <i>its</i> dependence on colonial violence, forced labor, and the resulting capital wealth. Even in this latter kind of formulation, modernity comes first (not to mention Anglo-Europeans), while coloniality provides its support system. Mignolo leads us to speak always of modernity/coloniality, in one breath, as one body, although with a slash through it. Even in acknowledging their meeting as a cut, modernity/coloniality holds histories together. The phrase helps to turn the either/or of, for instance, modern/primitive cultures, into the always-both-at-once of all travelling, modern/colonial materials: money, commodities, subjectivities, theories, and texts, the very transnational movement of which profits those living on the modern side of the slash. In world-system terms, the construction modernity/coloniality establishes the dialectical and contingent unfolding of each side of the pair&#x2014;economically, politically, technologically, militarily&#x2014;and it therefore allows us better to tell the story of an "uneven" unfolding. The unevenness is not merely territorial, of course&#x2014;here progress, there stagnation&#x2014;but rather matrixial and generative&#x2014;underdevelopment here <i>fosters</i> development there. And sexuality is conscripted to reproduce this matrix, under a racial and heteronormative logic: "our" women couple with "our" men, and "your" women with "your" men, to reproduce "our" race and "your" race&#x2014;and, in turn, the uneven order of things. In coloniality/modernity, this racial order cuts horizontally across national boundaries, at once stratifying the nation and lending it a transnational reach.  </p>

<p>With Mignolo in mind, then, <i>we can understand transnationalism as the shuttling activity through which nations have emerged under the episteme of modernity/coloniality and as reproduced by its racial and sexual ordering</i>. Stipulated in this way, transnationalism is structurally and dialectically implicated in nationalism. It <i>may </i>also 

<b></b>

be the historical ground of a contemporary, perhaps potentially more transgressive or equalizing transnationalism. In some of her novels Woolf hints at this possibility (in the queerly Chinese-eyed, yet English Lily Briscoe, for instance), whereas Larsen tends to represent its foreclosure. But in any case, the work of such Atlantic modernists indicates that we best judge the transformative possibilities of twenty-first-century transnationalism (in which the "trans" is not disavowed or subordinated) only when we discern in it the traces of this transnational history.  </p>

<p>Ignoring this historical legacy, we are tempted to distinguish neatly between liberatory and conservative transnationalisms&#x2014;between top-down, imperialist capitalism on the one hand, and bottom-up, mestiza, or cosmopolitan subversions on the other. Likewise, without this long history in mind, we might tend to associate racial ideology strictly with the organically-imaged nation and so cast the transnational as that which necessarily generates hybridity or border-identity or horizontal coalitions, in the process demystifying nativist notions of "peoples." But in English-language Atlantic modernity, at the least, notions of race and transnational movement across boundaries emerged together.  </p>

<p>On the English-language Atlantic, in fact, it is exactly race that has provided the motor and logic for a <i>liberationist</i> history, in turn authorizing the transnational reach of an Anglo-European modernity/coloniality, and persisting, in the twenty-first century, as a rallying trope for transnational communities. In the first part of this essay, I will sketch (as I have elsewhere) the ways that, since the seventeenth century, the idea of an inherited, native, <i>racialized</i> will to liberty has often authorized and propelled those apparent transgressions we are lately calling transnational. As part of the long back-story to Atlantic transnationalism and to the English-language modernism that further illustrated and troubled it, I analyze the crucial early decades of the seventeenth century in England, as England became a successful Atlantic presence. In these years, the English Civil War, culminating in the beheading of Charles I, issued not only in a strong, Atlantic colonial turn in English history but also in the concurrent fashioning of a new racial identity for English people, as free Anglo-Saxons.  </p>

<p>As with the Atlantic ventures of Spain and Portugal, these events both issued from and further constituted an emergent modernity/coloniality. Englishmen pursued their own "free," transnational future lived, at once profitably and dissentingly, under the sign of a nativist "birthright." Anglo-Atlantic women, too, laid claim to this birthright, which authorized their freer movement within transnational Atlantic circuits. Via this race-liberty logic, the very dissent, revolution, and violence that drove "a people" to behead its king and travel across an ocean also provided exhibit A for its members' racial kinship with each other, the homeland, and the past. The conjunction of race and liberty, as I argue here and in the longer project from which this essay is drawn, has provided an ideological formation that authorizes transnational movement even while racializing and nationalizing it; and this movement, conversely, accrues both economic and cultural capital <i>to</i> the nation.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Slave revolts and postcolonial revolutions have, in the name of an indigenous liberty, turned this logic back on the colonizer, but meanwhile have also participated in the racialization of liberty&#x2014;for that racialization has come to be a <i>condition</i> of their liberation.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Within this context, we can begin to see the extent to which English-language literature, including both African-Atlantic and Anglo-Atlantic writers, is a transnational literature, beginning in the later sixteenth century. In particular, as I will lay out in the middle of this essay, we can see with sudden clarity how the English-language novel forms around the story of a transnational and traumatic crossing, an Atlantic story of ruin and freedom, often written as a plot of sexual ruin or crisis, like Jacob Flanders's. Via this transnational and transatlantic narrative structure, furthermore, African-Atlantic and Anglo-Atlantic writers have engaged in a centuries-long dialectic, casting and recasting the violent "crossing" of Atlantic coloniality/modernity.  </p>

<p>Putting Anglo- and African-Atlantic stories side-by-side in this way, we can articulate one kind of answer to Paul Gilroy's call in <i>Black Atlantic </i>to "take the Atlantic as one single, complex unit of analysis" and "use it to produce an explicitly transnational and intercultural perspective"&#x2014;one which however foregrounds the ways that the national and racial are embedded in the transnational, and vice-versa.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Those writers I call Atlantic modernists look back on this vexed Atlantic legacy, as I will argue in the final third of the essay via discussion of Larsen and Woolf. They trouble its narrative uplift toward the telos of race-liberty, and they enact a queer undoing of its transnational force.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
How Freedom Became a Race Ideology
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>During the English Civil War, race unfurled as a freedom myth. Consider Englishman John Hare's revolution-defending pamphlet, <i>St Edward's Ghost or Anti-Normanism</i> : </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is no man that understands rightly what an Englishman is, but knows withal, that we are a member of the Teutonick nation, and descended out of Germany: a descent so honourable and happy, if duly considered, as that the like could not have been fetched from any other part of Europe . . . in England the whole commonalty, are German, and of the German blood; and scarcely was there any worth or manhood left in these occidental nations, after their long servitude under the Roman yoke, until these new supplies of freeborn men from Germany reinfused the same . . . Did our ancestors, therefore, shake off the Roman yoke . . . that the honour and freedom of their blood might be reserved for an untainted prey to a future conqueror?"<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Hare joins many others who yoke freedom and race in an Anglo-Saxon discourse of resistance to conquerors and tyranny. Over the next century, this discourse produced the notion that some races are born to seek freedom&#x2014;and therefore deserve it&#x2014;and others are not. By the later eighteenth century and until today in Iraq, peoples or races must, from a western point of view, demonstrate "their capacity" for freedom, or be ruined. In the western idea of freedom, race and modernity thus join hands, for the will to freedom is the very essence and driving force, according to G. W. F. Hegel and others, of modern world-history, a force actualized by "world-historical" races. As developed in these discourses, in modernity it is above all the capacity for freedom that measures a race.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Yet it is important that we recognize the seventeenth-century rhetoric not just as the seedbed for slavery, Nazism, and Anglo-European or American imperialism but also as the postcolonial revolutionary resistance it was intended to be. The early speakers of the paired discourses of race and freedom understood themselves to be reclaiming their trammeled native rights from foreign usurpers&#x2014;Norman, French, and popish. However imaginary, theirs was a postcolonial discourse.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Only when we recognize this old and dissenting genealogy of race and freedom do we understand fully the seductive power and social dynamics of race, especially its constitutive role in the modernity/coloniality dynamic running through nearly all circuits of transnationalism. At the same time, as we attend to this genealogy, we begin to glimpse the depth at which English-language narratives are racial narratives precisely to the degree that they are structured by a freedom plot.  </p>

<p>It was first of all the Reformation that gave rise to this new protoracial and Saxonist refashioning of English identity. The Anglo-Protestant search for links to the "primitive" German church predating Christianity's Roman Catholic dependence on bishops and popes initiated the turn toward an Anglo-Saxon lineage that would eventually become insistently racialized.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Thus Henry VIII authorized Matthew Parker to gather from England and abroad all documents revealing the Germanic and Anglo-Saxon origins of the "true and primitive" Church that predated popery (<i>OES</i>, 11). In his preface to <i>A Testimonie of Antiquities</i> (1566&#x2013;67), Parker drew on Saxon materials to authorize specific changes in Church practice, offering, as he put it, "testimonye of verye auncient tyme, wherein is plainly showed what was the judgement of the learned men in thys matter, in the days of the Saxons before the Conquest" (qtd. in <i>OES</i> 24&#x2013;5). This notion of a return to the Saxon ancestors' primitive honesty and simplicity laid the foundation for later, secular notions of race and specifically Anglo-Saxonism&#x2014;including Anglo-Saxonism's reincarnation, as Reginald Horsman has shown, among Thomas Jefferson and other "radical Whigs" in their visions of an independent United States.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>   </p>

<p>We can trace the turn from this strictly religious Anglo-Saxonism toward these more legal, cultural, and racial forms of Anglo-Saxonism by way of the Society of Antiquaries. Although originally founded by Tudor kings to support the Reformation, in the early decades of the seventeenth century, with the ascension to the throne of the absolutist Stuart kings James I and Charles I, the Society of Antiquaries turned its attention to old Saxon <i>legal</i> documents. As the Stuarts spoke with increasing insistence of their divine right to absolute rule, Parliament members began to make use of the legal documents being unearthed and translated by the Society's scholars to establish their right to debate laws and policies. Invoking the pre-Conquest Magna Carta and common law traditions, and presumably gathering evidence of Anglo-Saxon law-making councils, scholars such as Lambarde and Selden found themselves censored and imprisoned along with Sir Edward Coke and other Parliamentary lawyers who used these materials to challenge the Stuarts (<i>GE</i>, 126). Charles I finally disbanded the Society of Antiquaries by royal decree.  </p>

<p>Matters reached a crisis&#x2014;and the rhetoric of ancient Saxon rights found its legs&#x2014;when in 1620 the King issued a proclamation restricting Parliament's right to discuss 

<b></b>

high matters of state. Parliament responded directly, coining a language that would not only become the basis of its 1628 Petition of Right but would also create the heart of the Whig politics and Saxon myth that lasted well into the twentieth century:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The privileges and rights of Parliament are an ancient and indubitable birthright and inheritance of the English, and all important and urgent affairs in Church and State as well as the drawing up of laws and the remedying of abuses, are the proper subjects of the deliberation and resolutions of the Parliament. The members are free to speak upon them in such order as they please, and cannot be called to account for them. </p>

	<div class="attrib">
[<i>AL</i>, 38]
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In further exchanges with the King, the Parliament reasserted its "Ancient and Undoubted Right, and an Inheritance received from our Ancestors"&#x2014;sowing the seeds for a nativism that would later become racial and imperial&#x2014;until the King "publicly tore these protests from the Journal of the House of Commons and dissolved Parliament" (ibid.). Throughout the 1620s and 30s Parliament and the Stuart kings reached several such impasse moments. Finally, in 1629, Charles I dissolved Parliament&#x2014;and it did not reconvene until 1640.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, other forces were gathering. Across the Atlantic, a group of Englishmen was building a new commercial network that would eventually help to break the political impasse between King and Parliament&#x2014;and they were doing so through the rhetoric of a special English birthright to freedom. With the Parliamentary crisis of 1628&#x2013;9, culminating with Charles I's eleven-year dissolution of Parliament and renewed persecution of Puritans, a small group of Atlantic merchants who throughout the 1620s had been accruing land, power, and wealth in the west Atlantic joined hands with those interested in building colonies as safe havens for religious refugees. Together, to put it oversimply, these men overthrew the King. This is the period of Atlantic history that scholars of (at least) English-language modernity might attend to more closely, for here key terms are coined. In particular, the racialized rhetoric of liberty becomes a transatlantic phenomenon, and by the end of the seventeenth century it becomes embedded in the structures of English-language narrative, subtly organizing the colonial/modern psyche.  </p>

<p>Popular accounts of American colonization typically take a turn when they arrive at the disastrous bankruptcy of the early Virginia Colony; they leave behind that locale to tell the story of religious exile and the founding of the Puritan colony in Massachusetts. But not everyone left Virginia after the failure of the Virginia Company. On the contrary, the most important story of North American colonization may lie with the men who stayed on. Men such as Maurice Thomson and his brother-in-law William Tucker, who had begun as ship captains, entered the breach left by the retreat of the King's trading companies in Virginia.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The absence of Royal Company rules allowed these men to run both exports and imports and to set up shop on both sides of the Atlantic (a practice prohibited in the royal companies). As a result they quickly monopolized the import of supplies for settlers as well as the export of tobacco. They accrued huge profits. Working together with a handful of others, they eventually expanded their reach south to the West Indies (where they headed interloping invasions against the colonies 

<b></b>

of other European powers) and north to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, financially backing the Puritan settlement of Massachusetts and helping to organize provisions for colonies both north and south.  </p>

<p>In the 1620s through the 1640s, as Robert Brenner notes, there thus evolved "growing ties between the American merchant leadership and the great Puritan aristocrats who ran the Bermuda and Providence Island companies, as well as the lesser gentry who governed the New England colonies" (<i>MR</i>, 149). These ties laid the foundation for the "transatlantic network of Puritan religio-political opposition to the crown" that included Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and, in the West Indies, Bermuda Island and Providence Island, all of which drew investors for religious and political reasons as well as for profits and all of which served as both "ports of exile and staging posts for revolt" (<i>MR</i>, 113, 110). Under these conditions, the pursuit of religious freedom, so touted in U.S. history books, was deeply involved with the pursuit of mercantile freedom: for, even when religious motives were paramount, economic "freedoms" were requisite to make the colonial settlements viable, as Karen Kupperman has shown.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Furthermore, it was from this base, and for this base, that Maurice Thomson and his circle began to interlope in the slave trade and the East Indies trade, and then in turn to build the enormously profitable West Indies sugar plantations during the 1640s (<i>MR</i>, 161&#x2013;5).  </p>

<p>And of course, as C.L.R. James, Eric Williams, and others since have shown, these sugar plantations significantly funded England's entry into the emerging economic world-system that would manufacture, so to speak, modernity/coloniality.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  More immediately, these colonial developments shaped the events of the Civil War in England&#x2014;so that, for instance, the colonialists' tobacco and sugar profits fueled Parliamentary warships.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  In a sense, the English Civil War and its aftermath, from Cromwell's Commonwealth to Queen Victoria's empire, find their necessary cause in the 1610s through the 1630s, in the form of a transatlantic group of "new men"&#x2014;middling-class and eventually Puritan-affiliated&#x2014;who initiated the activities and alliances that would reshape the economic balance of power (consolidating a shift that had begun with land distribution, privatization, and enclosure in the sixteenth century).  </p>

<p>But this is not all. A nativist-tinged rhetoric of liberty crucially authorized this entry of England into the transnationality of the modern/colonial world&#x2014;and it did so regardless of whether this ideology was an essential cause or a serviceable epiphenomenon. Many of the transatlantic and merchant petitions to Parliament during the mid-1640s cultivated the language of freedom and rights, often accented&#x2014;although almost no scholars have analyzed it&#x2014;with nativist tones. Various groups took up this language, including both these new merchants (who turned it against royal-company monopolies) and the disenfranchised (who turned it against these very same merchants, in order to challenge the merchants' newly emerging monopolies). In "The Humble Petition of Divers Citizens"  presented to the London City Council, as the writers challenge the contradictions in the new Parliament's policies, they implicitly invoke a proto-Whig and nativist liberty rhetoric: 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Seeing the Parliament ordained, that none should be accepted to be a Parliament-man, that had been a Monopolizer to the Kings Councell, and false judges against the Liberties of the free-men of <i>England</i>, is it not as unjust to imploy [<i>sic</i>] any man in a place of Trust, Credit, or profit now in Parliament . . . , that have been known to be a Monopolizer in any place or Office to or for the Parliament, to the prejudice of the Free-men of <i>England</i>?<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Likewise, "A Remonstrance of Many Thousand Citizens, and other Free-Born People of England to theire [<i>sic</i>] own House of Commons" complains of "the oppression of the Turkey Company, and the Adventures Company, and all other infringements of our Native Liberties [which] yee seemed to abominate, are now by you complyed [<i>sic</i>] withall, and licensed to goe [<i>sic</i>] on" (<i>TLP</i>, III, 358). Via the momentum of these political, economic, gender, and religious struggles, a new libertarian narrative of a native, Saxonist identity began to take hold.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, with the temporary abolition of an official censorship office in the 1640s, this racialized liberty rhetoric spread "downward."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  In the absence of censorship, there circulated increasing numbers of polemical newspapers, pamphlets, and petitions that eventually made it impossible for the entrepreneurs and the Puritans to maintain control of the liberty discourse. Indeed, this is the moment when the Habermasian public sphere becomes a reality in England&#x2014;briefly yet influentially.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Especially as the Puritan-slanted Parliament gained the upper hand in the war, numerous petitions were presented to the House of Commons, expressing the desire of soldiers, soldiers' wives, tradespeople, religious sects, and laborers for relief from painful economic conditions and for fuller representation of their voices. This is also the period with which Janet Lyon begins her wonderful study of manifestoes in modernity, casting these documents as deliberate expressions of "the breach between modernity's promissory notes and their payment."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  But the racial rhetoric lacing these documents is equally formative of coloniality/modernity, including as it eventually shapes modernist writing.  </p>

<p>All of these groups, women as well as men, spoke of "native rights," "the people's just rights and liberties," their ancient "privileges," the "Nation's freedoms," "the free-born people of England," and the "free-born People's freedoms or rights."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Their emphasis is on a peculiarly English legacy of liberty. Politicized middle-rank women as well as men participated in this emergent discourse, writing petitions, holding meetings, and joining or leading public protests. Early in 1641, for instance, four hundred women gathered at Parliament to demand a response to a petition on the loss of trade. When they received no satisfactory answer, they penned the "Humble Petition of many hundreds of distressed women, Tradesmens wives, and widdowes" in which they claimed that "we have an interest in the common Privileges with them [who have petitioned for the] Liberty of our Husbands, persons, and estates."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The liberty rhetoric was also taken up by women preachers, who defended their public speaking by claiming a right "equall unto men, as also a proportionable share in the freedoms of the Commonwealth" ("UCS," 102). </p>

<p>Pamphleteer Nathaniel Bacon was among those who elaborately laid out the Saxonist historical narrative underlying this nativist rhetoric that would become Whig orthodoxy

by the early eighteenth century. In his <i>Historical and Political Discourse of the Laws and Government of England</i>, which addressed the "Debate concerning the Right of an English King to Arbitrary Rule over English Subjects, as Successor to the Norman Conqueror" , Bacon remarked that it is  </p>

<p class="continued">Such pronouncements opened the way to more radical thinkers such as the Diggers, who nonetheless invoked the same protoracial, nativist rhetoric. The Digger Gerard Winstanley echoed it in pronouncing that "the last enslaving conquest which the enemy got over Israel was the Norman over England" (<i>PR</i>, 179). The many transnational migrations, colonial rebellions, historical ironies, and disavowed crimes&#x2014;not to mention the fork-tongued texts&#x2014;of English-language Atlantic history arose from and within this inextricable intertwining of the colonial, revolutionary, and nativist roots of the modern notion of freedom. The material circuit of transnational activities&#x2014;at once dissenting and protocapitalist&#x2014;encouraged the race discourse that came to define the coloniality/modernity matrix.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Racial Transnationalism's Interior Force
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The race-liberty legacy also began in the seventeenth century to be cast as both an interior and a historical force, an important development to notice if we are to see the racialized historical content that modernism grappled with in its later "inward turn" and its refashioning of social subjectivity. This early interior turn challenged the paradigm under which the monarchy and its subjects obeyed a divine law, and in which the ruling head of the king decreed laws for the body of the people. The new formation placed the source of laws and principles within each person (partly under the influence of the Protestant Reformation, which, as we saw, itself had a nativist inflection in England). Its more strictly political aspect was signalled by Leveller pamphleteer John Warr in his claim that "Justice was in men, before it came to be in Laws" and was conceptualized more suggestively in Winstanley's notion that "the great Creator, who is the Spirit Reason" and is man's "teacher and ruler within himself" generates "the spreading power of righteousness that gives liberty to the whole creation" (<i>GE</i>, 269; <i>PR</i>,174&#x2013;6). In these formulations, freedom's nativized historical legacy gets rooted within the psyche of the person&#x2014;which potentially opens the way to the universalization of freedom claims. But under the pressure of an emergent capitalism and Atlantic modernity/coloniality matrix, the contrary eventually occurs: interiority itself is made 

<b></b>

native and exclusive&#x2014;a new site of cultural chauvanism, a new rationale for the racial terrorism of slavery, whose victims were said to lack such an interior.  </p>

<p>In the course of the eighteenth century, history and literature performed the cultural work of fashioning this native, English interior and creating an English-language imaginary formed around it. First of all, historian after historian, from Rapin to Gibbon, eclipsed the Britons' influence in English history-proper and gave pride of place to the freedom-seeking Germanic (or Gothic) Anglo-Saxons, famed for implanting a "free," participatory form of government in England. In his epic narrative-poem "Liberty" , James Thomson tells a popular version of the tale that the historians worked to document&#x2014;of "Liberty's" travels from Greece to Rome and then, triumphantly, to the northern climes, from which region the "yellow-haired, the blue-eyed Saxon" of "the Gothic nations" dispersed to carry liberty to England and the world.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Even the more conservative David Hume, an open critic of Whig politics, contributed to this emergent orthodoxy in his immensely influential <i>History of England</i>. In his account, the Britons showed a too-weak devotion to liberty under the Romans, whereas the Anglo-Saxons' "manners and customs were wholly German" so that they displayed "a fierce and bold liberty [which] gave rise to those mutual jealousies between them and the Normans."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Importantly, he also suggests that the Anglo-Saxons initiated record-keeping to underwrite their government, and in this sense he positions himself as their freedom-upholding historian-descendant. Several decades later, writing his magisterial <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> (1776&#x2013;1778), Edward Gibbon could count on his British readers' assent to the fantasy that "the invincible Goths . . . issued in numerous swarms from the neighborhood of the Polar circle, to chastise the oppressors of mankind."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  And this of course is the story the Anglo-American revolutionaries proudly inherited&#x2014;fashioning themselves as the true Whigs who would do right by the Anglo-Saxon legacy. For, as Trevor Colbourn remarks in his seminal study of the influence of Saxonist history on the American Revolution, in the minds of the rebellious American colonists "English history had been the history of freedom," which now required Anglo-Americans to carry it forward.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>   </p>

<p>But it is the radical-Whig historian Catharine Macaulay who explicitly makes this Germanic legacy a dimension of an interior, English <i>sensibility</i>. In her account of "the exalted patriots" who "attacked the pretensions of the Stewart [<i>sic</i>] family, and set up the banner of Liberty," she explains that "noble principles had taken deep root in the minds of the English people," specifically those principles that "the people had preserved from the ruins of the Gothic constitution" which "had in it many latent resources to preserve Liberty."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  She advocates that this "inward principle of love to their country and of public Liberty" be actively cultivated in educating "English youth."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Macaulay thus develops an interiorized notion of psychically and organically "rooted" liberty impulses in the English. A couple of generations later, the historian Mercy Otis Warren helped to establish the transatlantic life of this formulation for U.S. Americans.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In a distinct echo of Macaulay, Warren's <i>History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution</i>  casts liberty as a "noble principle implanted in the nature of man" (<i>HRP</i>, I: 2&#x2013;3). She characterizes the American revolutionaries 

<b></b>

as paying homage to the "ancestors who . . . planted them in a happy soil," explaining that, although the colonists were "strongly attached to Great Britain, not only by the impression of ancient forms, but by religion, manners, language, and consanguinuity," in the new world they faced "a yoke unknown to their fathers" (<i>HRP,</i> I: 4, 99,109). Moved by their "hereditary love of freedom" and their "manly spirit of freedom," they had no choice but to revolt (<i>HRP</i>, I: 109).  </p>

<p>This psychohistorical fashioning of a racial will to freedom reaches its metaphysical climax and full flowering into racism in the later work of G. W. F. Hegel, especially in his <i>Philosophy of History</i>. At first, Hegel uncannily echoes the revolutionary Gerard Winstanley, in arguing that "Reason" drives the "Universal History" of the world toward "Freedom," but then the racial terms of his conception come into view as he argues that this energy has been most powerfully generated and instituted by German and especially Anglo-German culture: "The German spirit is the Spirit of the new World. Its aim is the realization of absolute Truth as the unlimited self-determination of Freedom. The destiny of the German peoples is to be the bearers of the Christian principle of Spiritual Freedom" and this principle has been "preserved in England more than in any other country."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Giving full expression to the racism that grew out of England's revolutionary nativism, Hegel infamously turns from proclaiming that "the History of the World is nothing but the development of the Idea of Freedom" to his insistence that Africans and Native Americans lack this Protestant "subjectivity" and world-historical freedom-consciousness and so stand outside of history: "Negroes see nothing unbecoming them [in slavery]" and Africa "is no historical part of the World," while American "aborigines" have no "independence of feeling," and show only a "crouching submissiveness."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  In this formulation, the Anglo-Saxon inheritance becomes both a sensibility and a world-historical force, rolling over and past any "peoples" who apparently lack its proud "independence of feeling." Thus did a racialized discourse of Englishness arise with the Reformation, become intertwined with the idea of liberty during the English Civil War, fashion a free interiority in the course of the eighteenth century, and ultimately provide a revolutionary ballad structure for an operatic, epic racism by the end of that century.  </p>

<p>This account of the discursive and political coupling of race and liberty in Atlantic history revises Benedict Anderson's account of the nation as well as current theories of transnationalism. It clarifies how the race-liberty matrix holds together an otherwise strained and double movement in nation-formation&#x2014;and in subject-formation. Race works as a binding force <i>in the face of</i> the nation's own transnational dispersions; and the racing of liberty makes a virtue of this tension: if races manifest their spirits exactly by way of their deracinating struggles for freedom and their restless, "wilderness-clearing" movement across the globe, then the nations "of" those races are always trans-nations&#x2014;nations-plus, nations bursting and overflowing in their pursuit of freedom. Modern nations are nations-on-the-move. The best nations are global, and yet, by way of the idea of race, they are all the more national for that. Colonization thus becomes the fulfillment of a missionary and national destiny.  </p>

<p>And likewise for subjects: like Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Conrad's Marlow, those who journey across oceans to the places farthest from home turn out to be the most 

<b></b>

native, the nation's storytellers and the very embodiment of Englishness. We might note that the novel in English, from its inception with Aphra Behn's <i>Oroonoko</i>, repeatedly follows this pattern. Indeed, Anglo-Atlantic authors have consistently encoded this transnational race-liberty plot (after Behn, effacing the African-Atlantic role within it), while African-American authors have rewritten it and reclaimed the plot as theirs. Even a moment's pause over the implicit dialogue between Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and Olaudah Equiano's <i>Interesting Narrative</i>&#x2014;both of whose protagonists launch into Atlantic coloniality/modernity on "Guiney" slaving ships, "fall" into captivity, and yet rise into (free) Protestant Englishness&#x2014;should hint as much.  </p>

<p>Most often, and particularly relevant to my final argument here about the "libidinal currents" and sexual crises of modernism, English-language novels have used a sexual plot, with a ruinous fall at its center, to narrate the subject's transatlantic undoing and remaking under the sign of racial freedom.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  To appreciate modernism's reworking of this sexual element of the paradigm, it is instructive briefly to juxtapose two earlier texts&#x2014;Nathaniel Hawthorne's <i>Scarlet Letter</i> and Pauline Hopkins's <i>Contending Forces</i>. Hawthorne makes the events of his novel exactly contemporary with the English Revolution. At the center of it is a woman's "fall," catalyzed by a crossing of the Atlantic. The heroine's experience&#x2014;and her secretly free interior&#x2014;becomes all the more Anglo-American by virtue of her fall: "Standing alone in the world,&#x2014;alone, as to any dependence on society . . . [s]he assumed a freedom of speculation then common enough on the other side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had they known of it, would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatized by the scarlet letter."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  And thus has Hester come to stand in the canon for a paradigmatic Anglo-American independence of spirit. Her ruinous, ocean-crossing undoing that ends with her remaking (whether tragic or comic) as a free, modern subject becomes one master-narrative of the novel in English&#x2014;in texts from Defoe's<i> Moll Flanders</i> to Matthew Lewis's <i>The Monk</i> to Susanna Rowson's <i>Charlotte Temple</i> (the first&#x2014;and wildly popular&#x2014;American-published novel) to Melville's <i>Billy Budd</i>, in which this (feminized) sailor is ruined not only by Atlantic martial law but also by the suppressed and vengeful yearnings of Claggart.  </p>

<p>In these novels as in Hawthorne's, the protagonist's story of transnational travel, ruin, and freedom allegorizes that of the Anglo-Atlantic nation&#x2014;and substitutes for its larger political exclusions and ruinous violence (although Melville passingly acknowledges this Atlantic order when he opens and shadows his novella with the re of an African sailor). In Hawthorne's case, he fashions Hester as a singular, lonely subject exactly by eclipsing the transatlantic history that places her on American soil. For of course the "forefathers" knew full well about the speculation on the other side of the Atlantic, as Hawthorne himself would have been aware and his choice of the 1640s as his time period hints. As we saw, the Massachusetts colony was fully involved with events and people in England and on the continent (we need only recall that these Puritan settlers had first lived in Holland before removing to America), and those transatlantic speculations underlay the very founding of such a colony. But Hawthorne allows Hester's sexual ruin and his narration of her interior to stand <i>in place of</i> the revolutionary and mercantile history as well as the treachery and war practiced on Native Americans that made the 

<b></b>

colony viable. Indeed Hawthorne labors to make the colony's elders innocent of that history&#x2014;guilty only of "sins" against a free woman.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Pauline Hopkins makes explicit allusion to <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> in her fiction, and in <i>Contending Forces</i> she brings to light the violent Atlantic history muffled within it.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  She, too, makes a woman's ruin the vehicle of this Atlantic history, yet in her fiction the fall occurs as <i>a direct effect of</i> this history rather than a sublimating substitute for it. Hopkins begins her story in Bermuda, on a plantation of hundreds of slaves. As she enters the mind of its owner, Charles Montfort, who is planning to emigrate to the U.S. to avoid immediately freeing his slaves, the disjunctive turns of her prose mimic the equivocations and narrative displacements required for the romanticization of this story. Meanwhile she inverts the plot, allowing the vengeful return of a repressed Atlantic history: shortly after Montfort's family's arrival in the U.S., he is murdered by white neighbors who suspect his wife of having Negro blood, she is apparently raped, and <i>his</i> children are enslaved or dispersed across the Atlantic ocean. Two generations later, this family's story converges with that of a young woman named Sappho Clark, a mulatta who is brutally raped by one of her white relatives, after which she goes incognito, migrates north, and eventually marries one of the descendants of the Montfort family. The novel ends with Sappho and her husband on board a ship ready to cross the Atlantic to England in order to claim an inheritance from another of the runaway Montforts who died rich there. In effect, Hopkins's novel itself reclaims an Atlantic history and a literary inheritance that Anglo-Atlantic novelists have suppressed or stolen.  </p>

<p>In this vexed dialectical way, from the 17<sup>th</sup> to the 20th centuries, I argue, a diverse range of English-language narratives move along the racialized, transatlantic arc that launches modernity/coloniality. They variously construct, recast, and question it. From a specifically U.S. viewpoint, these Atlantic texts structurally narrate the fact that "American history is always international and diasporic history," as Robin Kelley argues.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  To a certain extent, they also display how the same can be said of British history and literature&#x2014;and of some key Anglophone texts, which is one reason why I refer here to "English-language literature," borrowing but revising William Spengemann's use of this term.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>   </p>

<p>I want once more to emphasize that the trope of an Atlantic crossing repeatedly correlates in this paradigm with what (in the larger project) I call a swoon moment, involving a bodily "undoing" or "ruin" that is often sexual or coded as feminine: a character faints or momentarily collapses, overcome with an experience of violation by a terrorizing or tyrannizing force, whether seducer, slaver, or swallowing sea storm. The swoon marks the subject's formation in modernity/coloniality, dramatizing the way the process of transformation faces the subject with an abyss, a lack of ground, so that as it loses its old social identity, it faints&#x2014;only to reawaken, uprooted and yet newly racialized, "born again" from its own ashes. A primal, symbolic scene operating by way of displacement and condensation like Freudian dreamwork, the swoon distills the "undoing" effects of Atlantic violence arising from slavery, deracination, and the Atlantic's unanchoring, sink-or-swim, new capitalist economy. In effect, the protagonist's swoon signals the "trans" in the national: it marks the perilous, transatlantic passage that decides the person's destiny within the nation and its racialized order of freedom.

Atlantic Modernism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>This long story of Atlantic history and English-language literature sheds a different light on English-language modernism. It suggests that there is something we can call Atlantic modernism, which would include writers identified with a range of literary race-traditions. These writers craft metafictions of this Atlantic history, some more critically or consciously than others.  </p>

<p>For, in fact, a whole fleet of modernist protagonists undertake water-crossing, racialized, transnational, and often failed launchings toward freedom that turn on a sexual fall and swoon: think of Jean Rhys's Marya, James's Isabelle Archer, and Forster's Adele. In Stein's ocean-crossing stories of "Gentle Lena," "Melanctha," and <i>The Making of Americans</i>, we find tales of "wandering" women made ill and finally sunk by the insistent demands of transnationally-formed racial and heteronormative identities, including both Germanness and Negro-ness&#x2014;and reinforced in the violence of Stein's own racist discourse.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In Claude McKay's <i>Banjo</i>, his Afro-Caribbean and African-American characters (re)cross the Atlantic to Marseilles where they mingle with a diasporic community of Indians, Asians, and Africans; yet in the end they disperse again, thus yielding McKay's "novel without a plot"&#x2014;or as I would see it, his novel without a race destiny and freedom telos. McKay's novel furthermore pivots on the transatlantic, kissing-reunion of Jake and Banjo, whose final departure from Marseilles together entails a provocative, perhaps Sedgwickian sexual crisis involving their desire for the same woman.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Many of these authors, including McKay, Stein, Larsen, and Hemingway, flatten or make inaccessible their characters' subjective interiors, as if to demystify or make opaque the racialization of "deep" subjectivity; while others such as Woolf, Barnes, and Joyce seem determined to excavate characters' subterranean racial and sexual imaginations. Yet all of these authors' queer, alienated, or deconstructive aesthetic projects show a wry cynicism about racialized subjectivities. Accordingly, in Atlantic modernist novels, the genre's often-sentimental or redemptive swoon becomes stylized, diminished, or parodied&#x2013;such as in Sasha Jansen's final ruin at the hands of her anonymous hotel neighbor&#x2014;her final "drowning," as she casts it. What gets drowned, rejected, or lost in these distilled swoons is not so much a prelapsarian or virgin self, as in many earlier English-language novels, but rather a certain straying, queerly sensuous self.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Like these other modernists, Larsen and Woolf collapse the novel's freedom trajectory exactly by putting pressure on the racial and sexual matrix of modernity/coloniality. As they begin to step aside from the freedom plot, they accordingly begin to unravel its racial and sexual bindings and to question the allure of transnational mobility and (as we would put it today) hybridity. When Larsen takes Countee Cullen's lines about a speaker "three centuries removed" from Africa as the epigraph to <i>Passing</i>, and Woolf embeds allusions to Sir Walter Raleigh in her sea-soaked novels, beginning with Rachel Vinrace's "voyage out" into South America, they gesture toward the historical and transatlantic horizon in which they write.

<b></b>

  </p>

 

<p>Woolf's novels repeatedly recast the Atlantic story of liberty and ruin. Postcolonial readings of Woolf most often consider her in relation to India, sensibly, since it is the most frequently referenced imperial locale in her work, and they give some attention to the South American setting in <i>The Voyage Out</i>. If, however, we consider these water tropes in her writing as expressions of the colonial legacy more broadly, we can better plumb the depth of her brooding on the sea-crossing past and transnational substructure of the British empire. While a number of critics have brought to the surface the plentiful gay or queer currents of Woolf's writing, only Robin Hackett has treated them at length in relation to empire, in her reading of <i>The Waves</i>.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  I want in addition to suggest that when we trace Woolf's water and drowning tropes within the context of a transatlantic imaginary in English-language fiction, we see how her entire oeuvre broods on this vortex of race, freedom, and sexuality.  </p>

<p>Read within the long history of the Atlantic, for instance, the plot of <i>The Voyage Out</i> suddenly appears much more pointed. It recasts the Atlantic crossing, including its pivotal turn on a ruinous kiss. From the outset, Woolf narrates this sea-crossing as a launch toward freedom. On the first morning of her characters' transatlantic journey, as they all rise together to the deck, Helen exclaims "Oh, look! We're out at sea!" and the narrator remarks on their state of feeling: " They were free of roads, free of mankind, and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Yet soon after Rachel finds herself alone on deck, and "down she looked into the depth of the sea," imagining the "black ribs of wrecked ships" (<i>VO</i>, 27). Insofar as the ship also gets red as an image of Rachel ("a bride going forth to her husband" in a state "more lonely than the caravan crossing the desert" and on a sea that "might give her death, or some unexampled joy"), the image of shipwreck preres Rachel's own fate in the freedom passage (<i>VO</i>, 19). </p>

<p>Rachel's symbolic ruin on this journey begins with Richard Dalloway's surreptitious kiss as his wife lies below deck recovering from seasickness after the storm in which they are all temporarily "unmoored" like "atoms flying in the void"&#x2014;in a self-unmaking, sea-storm trope that reaches directly back to <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>(<i>VO</i>, 72). On cue, just after he offers to send Rachel some copies of Burke's pamphlets on "the French revolution&#x2014;The American Rebellion," there follows the symbolic sexual fall associated, in the Atlantic imaginary, with these revolutions. The ship lurches, and Dalloway seizes the moment to "kiss her passionately, so that she felt the hardness of his body" after which she "fell back in her chair, with tremendous beats of the heart, each of which sent black waves across her eyes" (<i>VO</i>, 76). Her sleep that night is disturbed by nightmares.  </p>

<p>Overdetermined nightmares. Colonial nightmares. Swooning nightmares in which Rachel symbolically dies and then awakens into a "barbarian" surround. She dreams that she is trapped in a vault with "a little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering with long nails . . . and the face of an animal. The wall behind him oozed with damp . . . Still and cold as death she lay, not daring to move, until she broke the agony by tossing herself across the bed, and woke crying 'Oh!'" (<i>VO</i>, 77). Awaking from this terrorized, death-like state, "she felt herself pursued, so that she got up and actually 

<b></b>

locked her door. A voice moaned for her; eyes desired her. All night long barbarian men harassed the ship; they came scuffling down passages, and stopped to snuffle at her door" (<i>VO</i>, 77). Now implicitly marked as a non-barbarian, Rachel has arrived in Atlantic modernity/coloniality. Although she lands, so to speak, on the safer side of slash, this position also turns out to be deadly for a young, marriagable woman whose community looks to her, insistently, nostalgically, invasively, for its reproduction. As critics including myself have discussed, homoerotic ties also get sacrificed in this crossing-over experience, between Helen and Rachel as well as Hewett and Hirst.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In conflating, via Rachel's nightmares, the crass actions of Richard Dalloway with the threat of "barbarian men" who finally reappear during the delirium that forecasts her death (red as her drowning fall), Woolf reenacts the long Atlantic history of substitutions in which the coercions of colonizing Anglo-Atlantic peoples get reframed, in white people's imaginations, as the threat of the colonized. Without entering here into the question of how much critical distance Woolf exercises in these representations, which I do elsewhere, we can observe that she follows the logic in which "barbarian men" become the fall guys for Anglo-Atlantic subjects, for the English-proud Richard Dalloways.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  For my purposes in this essay, it is enough to note that in this, her first novel, Woolf intuitively labors to rewrite and expose the runinous effects of an old Atlantic plot.  </p>

<p>One could walk through each of Woolf's novels charting her navigation of this Atlantic literary and political history. To take another fairly obvious example before turning at more length to a less obvious one, in <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, Woolf narrates the death of a mother in the wake of a sea storm and the subsequent journey of a brother-sister pair who feel forced into a "compact" to "t tyranny to the death."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  She just hints that the imperial woman's stormy death entails a loss of homoerotic yearnings (on Lily's part and, as Ruth Vanita has persuasively shown, on Bankes's and Carmichael's parts as well), although it may also leave more room for a gay comraderie and an art working outside of a racial telos.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Woolf organizes the family drama of this novel around the sea. In "The Window," Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay's relationship unfolds through their opposed orientations toward an Atlantic horizon and its future. They argue especially over the question of whether a sea adventure will be possible for the youngest son, James, who Mrs. Ramsay already imagines at the center of the British empire, "all red and ermine on the Bench" (<i>TL</i>, 4). In the end, Mr. Ramsay's pessimism is correct, and in "Time Passes," Mrs. Ramsay dies amidst "a downpouring of immense darkness," while the "sea tosses itself and breaks itself" during days and nights "full of wind and destruction" (<i>TL</i>, 125, 128). In the final section of the novel, after the loss of their mother, brother, and sister in this interruptive, sea-tossed section of the novel that encapsulates historical time's passing, Cam and James Ramsay launch out on their long-awaited, historically overdetermined journey.  </p>

<p>In her narration of this journey, Woolf indicates that Cam and James symbolically enter Atlantic history when they embark. She evokes, first of all, their shared sense of freedom at setting out, like that of the characters in <i>The Voyage Out</i>: "James, with his 

<b></b>

eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered grimly. But he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he might be quit of it all. They might land somewhere; and be free then. Both of them [Cam and James], looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape and exaltation, what with the speed and the change" (<i>TL</i>, 165). Meanwhile, the brother and sister pledge themselves "united in their compact to t tyranny to the death" in the form of their father (<i>TL</i>, 164). Yet like all such journeys, this excursion is full of perils and losses, as Woolf insinuates when she interweaves her narration of it with Macalister's tale of a recent sea storm and shipwreck and at the same time punctures it with Mr. Ramsay's sudden cries that (in Atlantic modernity/coloniality) "We perished each alone" (<i>TL</i>, 164&#x2013;5). And Cam, after all, waivers in her commitment to this journey and its telos. She finds herself more interested in the water's rush on her palm and in those ruined things lost at the bottom of the sea, like Rachel Vinrace. She feels caught in a story that is more her father's and brother's than hers.  </p>

<p>And up on the cliff, Lily paints and watches this scene with Chinese eyes. And Woolf paints Lily painting and watching. And we can watch them both engaged in acts of encoded representation, queers in allegiance, as Ruth Vanita suggests, yet also artists accruing capital exactly from that "chinese" otherness. At this point in the long history, as Woolf seems to have understood, race need hardly be mentioned as a key to the story. The Ramsay men have large foreheads and blue eyes, the young woman artist has Chinese eyes, the old woman cleaning and preserving the house has the name McNab, all while Mr. Ramsay continues reading the quintessential British novelist Walter Scott. The children t tyranny as they set out on the sea, thinking that when they land they will "be free then." The code is encrypted, an encrypting that Woolf's artistry imitates. At the same time, keeping in mind Urmilla Seshagiri's reading of Lily as, in effect, a colonialist artist, borrowing forms (like Woolf) from African and Oriental traditions as instruments of dissent within her own culture, we can note that Woolf's own practice evinces her immersion in this legacy.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For even clearer, more pointed indications of Woolf's self-consciousness about this legacy in which her art is entangled, it is helpful to turn back to the less subtle <i>Jacob's Room</i>. The novel begins with Jacob as a boy at seaside, rocked by his discovery of a hidden, kissing couple; it juxtaposes his sea crossings and his foreign travel against the background of English sea storms back home; it sets the story's most queerly sexual moment on a boat; and it foreshadows his death in war as a drowning of soldier-sailors. Furthermore, in this early novel Woolf depends on a more obtrusive narrator to establish that she means to probe a little more deeply into the "chasms" in Atlantic modernity/coloniality, with its wars, empires, exiles at sea, and capsized desires. She reminds her readers of the transnational travels subtextually fostering and structuring the life of the nation. Take the following passage, in which her narrator steps aside to comment: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The strange thing about life is that though the nature of it must have been apparent to everyone for hundreds of years, no one has left any adequate account of it. The streets of London have their map; but our passions are uncharted. What are you going to meet if you turn this corner?

<p>As frequent as street corners in Holborn are these chasms in the continuity of our ways. Yet we keep straight on. </p>

<p class="continued">Placed here, as the sunken story, is the history of sea and empire that touches and shapes all those you might meet around a corner in Holborn&#x2014;the story of ships and fevers and crimes committed, fill in the sketch as you like. These stories harbor the chasms in "the continuity of our ways," the swoons in our sea crossings.  </p>

<p>Woolf's narrator, filling in the sketch, creates an aesthetic analogue for such chasms when she leaps abruptly in the next paragraph (as if across the slash between coloniality and modernity) to the paradigmatic story of a modern "Helen and Jimmy," and the crisis of Jimmy's refusal to marry Helen. The narrator reports that the community's gossipers, "kind Mr. Bowley and dear Rose Shaw" deplore Jimmy's refusal, which looms as a threatening chasm in their ways. In a seeming non sequitur (and another textual chasm) the narrator then suddenly turns to the reader and remarks that "if you persist that a command of the English language is a part of our inheritance, one can only reply that beauty is almost always dumb. Male beauty in association with female beauty breeds in the onlooker a sense of fear. Often have I seen them&#x2014;Helen and Jimmy&#x2014;and likened them to ships adrift, and feared for my own little craft" (<i>JR</i>, 83). These comments imply that, far from embodying "our inheritance" of an articulate, English-language civilization, Helen and Jimmy, and their policing admirers, are adventuring ships on the loose, doing damage. Woolf's prose follows their lurching, crashing movements.  </p>

<p>These odd juxtapositions and shifts are typical of <i>Jacob's Room</i>. The narrative not only stays behind, so to speak, at the end of a scene to capture what's lost in the break or cut&#x2014;the emptiness of a room from which humans have departed, or the ravaging winds of a sea storm to which sleepers are indifferent&#x2014;but it also habitually swerves from the trivial matchmaking of the Bowleys and Shaws to the transnational theater of world war. Woolf's juxtapositions consistently imply that normative sexuality is at stake in this war and its attendant colonial crimes, and that apparently harmless gossip about who should marry whom carries behind it an immense and deadly "force." Thus in another scene, just after the gossipers dissect what they consider Clara Durrant's "alarming" depths of feeling (which might swamp her proper choice of partner) and then coyly refer to Dick Bonamy as a "dark horse" with a "peculiar disposition" (since he is a man who by his own account "couldn't love a woman"), the narrator again disconcertingly, without explanation, lifts her eye to the horizon and away from this heteronormative world of gossip (<i>JR</i>, 135,122). Our gaze is directed to a fleet of battleships on the North Sea:

<p class="continued">Woolf here sums up the whole transnational, force-driven order of things&#x2014;its disciplining of bodies; its global network of banks, laboratories, chancellories, houses of business, and police; its eschewing of sudden (sexual) impulses; and its deadly wars that drown young men, like Jacob, in the prime of life.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile the novel tracks Jacob's wandering travels through Italy and Greece, haunted by his wandering, queer desires simultaneously for his intimate friend Bonamy and for Clara Durrant, and it reveals his sudden plunges into depression. While in Greece for instance (notably), provoked by his reading of the transnational newspaper, the <i>Daily Mail</i>, Jacob suddenly feels engulfed by "this gloom&#x2014;this surrender to the dark waters which lap us about," falling into a depressed mood which, the narrator remarks, is "a modern invention" (<i>JR</i>,121). Although he momentarily fantasizes going into Parliament and making speeches about the world's problems, he asks "but what use are fine speeches, once you surrender an inch to the black waters?" Ultimately, Woolf implies at the end of her novel, he joins the war and is indeed surrendered to the black waters. He will fall from the boat along with other young men and "go under," not merrily like Shakespeare or the Greeks, but under the weight of an unseizable force and an Atlantic history of overpowering sorrow.  </p>

<p>In <i>Quicksand</i>, Larsen immediately signals the Atlantic double-cross underlying her fiction. The very name of her protagonist, Helga Crane, alludes to the Germanic and marine dimensions of the legacy. As I have argued elsewhere, Helga Crane becomes an Atlantic wanderer as she searches for what she calls "freedom, that blessed sense of belonging to herself alone and not to a race."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Here I want to emphasize how, in addition, at a key Atlantic turning point in Helga's story, Larsen hints that Helga is a queer subject whose transnational travel is provoked by (and fails to heal) her sexual as well as her racial alienation.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  From this angle, we can see that <i>Quicksand</i> provides a transatlantic backstory for <i>Passing</i>'s tale of queer desire.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>   </p>

<p>All of Helga's problems begin with an Atlantic crossing that is also a racial and sexual crossing. That is, they begin with her mother, a white Scandinavian woman 

<b></b>

who emigrates to the U.S., falls in love with an African-American man, gets pregnant, is abandoned, and thus is ruined in her movement toward freedom&#x2014;like many an immigrant or colonist before her. This mother eventually marries a white man whose family rejects Helga, which leaves Helga with "no people," as she puts it. In enfolding this story of Helga's mother into her novel, Larsen positions an old transatlantic, sexual plot of racialized self-loss at the heart of Helga's conflicts. We first learn of this history that Helga calls the "wound" of her past, when Dr. Anderson, the director of the Naxos school where she teaches, attempts to persuade her to stay at the school, which prizes, he says, "a lady" like her with "tendencies inherited from good stock" (<i>QP</i>, 21). "[J]olted into a rage," as the text puts it, Helga scornfully tells him her story and flees the school&#x2014;she flees its racial codes in search of an un-raced freedom&#x2014;only to repeat, ultimately, her mother's history of freedom-seeking, transatlantic crossings ending in racial "ruin" (<i>QP</i>, 22). </p>

<p>While Woolf creates characters caught <i>within</i> the racial telos of freedom, Larsen thus represents the struggle of those left <i>outside</i> of this narrative. In Larsen's rendering, Helga can find no freedom exactly because she lacks an embracing race community within which to pursue it. With no "people," Helga has no ready point of entr&#x00E9;e into the freedom story. She cannot do "uplift" into freedom if she is not fully identified with or accepted by any race. Helga's dilemma sharply discloses the history within which freedom has been made captive to race, and her story signals the flaw in any assumption that transnational travel will in itself offer liberation from anything, including race. Instead, Helga displays for us how transnational travel has structured the terms of race identity.  </p>

<p>Helga's predicament finds its earliest and most compact expression in her reflections on colorful dress. She indicts the school's "suppression of individuality and beauty," taking its disapproval of color and boldness in clothing as one instance of this suppression.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Yet she understands her own love of color as the "inherent <i>racial</i> need for gorgeousness, . . . [for] bright colors" (<i>QP</i>, 20, 18, emphasis added). Is dress an expression of the individual or the race? Is it unfettered individuality or racial identity that Helga seeks? Freedom from race, or freedom for the race?  </p>

<p>After Helga's arrival in New York, the plot of the novel might be characterized as her vacillating movement toward and away from race as a ground of identity, a series of racial reaction-formations in a quest for freedom.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  In New York, as at first in Chicago, Helga feels "that magic sense of having come home" for "Harlem, teeming black Harlem, had welcomed her and lulled her into something that was, she was certain, peace and contentment" (<i>QP</i>, 43). In her initial identification with African American community, she "lost that tantalizing oppression of loneliness and isolation" looking on the "white world" as a collection of "sinister folk . . .who had stolen her birthright" (<i>QP</i>, 45). The old language of birthright resurfaces here, just as later Larsen's narrator describes Helga as feeling "yoked" to race. In New York, she relishes a contentment that "she knew sprang from a sense of freedom, a release from the feeling of smallness which had hedged her in, first during her unchildlike childhood among hostile white folk . . . and later . . . among snobbish black folk in Naxos" (<i>QP</i>, 46). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Yet, as the next page and chapter announce, "it didn't last, this happiness" for "somewhere, within her, in a deep recess, crouched discontent" (<i>QP</i>, 47). In this new city of freedom, she again comes to feel "shut in, trapped" as she discovers that race encloses its landscape as well; so, increasingly "she made lonely excursions to places outside of Harlem" while "a sensation of estrangement and isolation encompassed her" (<i>QP</i>, 47&#x2013;8). She finds especially that she "wanted to be free of this constant prattling of the incongruities, the injustices, the stupidities, the viciousness of white people" (<i>QP</i>, 49). It is not only that she is bothered by the "inconsistencies" in her friends who hate but imitate the white world, but also that this hatred "stirred memories, probed hidden wounds, whose poignant ache bred in her surprising oppression and corroded the fabric of her quietism" (ibid.). The hidden wound is her unnameable kinship with whites and her subsequent experience of emotional isolation from all family and community.  </p>

<p>Thinking she can escape this oppression by leaving the U.S., when the letter from her uncle arrives containing money and suggesting she visit her white aunt in Copenhagen, her sensation is "one of relief, of liberation" (<i>QP</i>, 54). She realizes abruptly that she had been feeling "boxed up, with hundreds of her race, closed up with that something in the racial character which had always been, to her, inexplicable, alien" and now she wants no longer to be "yoked to these despised black folk" (<i>QP</i>, 55). At the very center of Larsen's novel, on board a ship sailing across the Atlantic to Europe, Helga feels a "returned sense of happiness and freedom, that blessed sense of belonging to herself alone and not to a race" (<i>QP</i>, 64).  </p>

<p>Helga's trip might promise to undo the legacy of the middle passage, but instead of freedom from race, in Copenhagen Helga finds that she is paraded by her aunt and uncle "like a veritable savage" (<i>QP</i>, 92). Their acceptance of her also depends, ultimately, on their deployment of her racialized, marriagable body to strengthen their ties to the wealthy social order. Far from providing an escape from race, Helga's transnational travel reveals how race gains its force and its charge exactly within this border-crossing circuit. Her exotic origins, her clothing, and her body all serve, in Africanist fashion, to display her relatives' risqu&#x00E9; social habits, but of course their liberty is her captivity. Helga's access to any such risqu&#x00E9; freedom is blocked equally by her apparent race identity and by her lack of race identity. </p>

<p>Moreover, in a move that both compares to and contrasts with Woolf's, Larsen hints at the queer feelings that threaten to arise within the racial lacunae that Helga occupies. She creates a quiet foreshadowing of the story she tells in <i>Passing</i>. In two scenes that frame Helga's Atlantic crossings&#x2014;the night club scene just before she departs from Harlem for Copenhagen and the party just after she returns to Harlem&#x2014;Larsen dramatizes the unanchoring of raced heteronormativity that attends, even unwillingly, Helga's rootless wandering across transnational borders.  </p>

<p>The chapter that precedes and, arguably, most urgently propels Helga's flight to Copenhagen, certainly ends on a very queer note. The moment is embedded, furthermore, in the most racially troubled scene in the novel, set in the Harlem cabaret that Helga "half unwillingly" goes to with Anne and her friends (<i>QP</i>, 58). In the midst of this scene, Helga takes a break from dancing and sits alone because she is troubled by 

<b></b>

feeling like "a jungle creature" when she dances. Looking around, she see Dr. Anderson across the room, sitting with a girl in a "shivering apricot frock" (<i>QP</i>, 60). Helga meets Anderson's gaze then turns her eyes away. </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p><i>	But</i> [the narrator tells us] they went back immediately to the girl beside him, who sat indifferently sipping a colourless liquid, or puffing a precariously hanging cigarette. Across dozens of tables, littered with corks, with ashes, with shriveled sandwiches, through slits in the swaying mob, Helga Crane studied her.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Across a series of obstacles suggestive of sexuality and its "withered" aftermath, Helga peers through a slit to fix her attention on Audrey Denney. Through Helga's eyes, the text caressingly details Denney's appearance, lingering over her "softly curving" yet "sorrowful" mouth, her pitch-black eyes "a little aslant . . . veiled by long, drooping lashes," her "dark hair brushed severely back," and finally the "extreme d&#x00E9;collet&#x00E9; of her simple apricot dress show[ing] a skin of unusual color, a delicate, creamy hue, with golden tones": "'Almost like an alabaster,' thought Helga" (ibid).  </p>

<p>Like Helga, Denney herself displays the light-skinned body that signifies transnational desire and ruin. Audrey's appearance openly queers racial and sexual norms, with her creamy skin and her severely brushed-back hair above an alluring d&#x00E9;collet&#x00E9;, a style extended into her choice of company, here the grey-eyed Anderson and, elsewhere, white people. Helga's dreamy enrapture by this body is sharply interrupted when, in the next sentence, the music stops and Helga's friend Anne arrives at the table with "rage in her eyes" and spews a diatribe about Denney as a "disgusting creature" who "ought to be ostracized" because she "goes about with white people" and throws racially mixed parties in which "white men dance with the coloured women" (ibid.). Helga herself, of course, always and involuntarily "goes about with white people" in her very genealogy, inwardly suffering the ostracization Anne fantasizes for Audrey Denney. No surprise, then, that Audrey Denney is so charged an object for Helga Crane. </p>

<p>Yet, in Larsen's rendering, Helga feels desire and attraction, not just identification. The chapter closes with a long paragraph devoted to Helga's observation of Audrey as she dances with Anderson "with grace and abandon, gravely, yet with obvious pleasure, her legs, her hips, her back, all swaying gently, swung by that wild music from the heart of the jungle" (<i>QP</i>, 62). As she continues watching, Helga suffers a kind of breakdown, perhaps what Patricia Juliana Smith would call a moment of sexual panic. Neither her exact emotion nor the exact object of it is specified in the description that follows, but the pressing, syncopated syntax builds a moment of racial and sexual crisis:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>She forgot the garish crowded room. She forgot her friends. She saw only two res, closely clinging. She felt her heart throbbing. She felt the room receding. She went out the door. She climbed endless stairs. At last, panting, confused, but thankful to have escaped, she found herself again out in the dark night alone, a small crumpled thing in a fragile, flying black and gold dress. A taxi drifted toward her, stopped. She stepped into it, feeling cold, unhappy, misunderstood, and forlorn. </p>

<p class="continued">By juxtaposition, Larsen implies that this scene catalyzes Helga's first transnational flight. Directly hereafter, the chapter ends and at the beginning of the next, we find Helga on an ocean liner headed across the Atlantic, "glad to be alone at last, free of that superfluity of human beings, yellow, brown, and black" (<i>QP</i>, 63). In leaving the U.S. and crossing the Atlantic to escape these bodies, however, Helga is perhaps also escaping her heart's desire, which takes the "lovely" form of the racially and sexually "superfluous" Audrey Denney. </p>

<p>And indeed Helga is drawn back exactly to this superfluity of queer beings who exceed the proper boundaries. Feeling trapped by race again in Copenhagen, she recrosses the Atlantic and returns to Harlem. She immediately attends a polyracial party where she again meets Robert Anderson, who still carries the shadow-presence of Audrey Denney. For Denney is at the party, too, and, in Helga's eyes, she again momentarily stands at the center of it. As Helga looks around, she sees African Americans, West Indians, a few white people, and "There too, poised, serene, certain, surrounded by masculine black and white, was Audrey Denney" (<i>QP</i>, 99). On this occasion, Helga directly asks to be introduced to this woman so oddly "surrounded by masculine black and white." </p>

<p>But this is the event that never occurs, neither in the chapter nor in the book&#x2014;not until, in displaced form, it perhaps surfaces in Larsen's next novella, <i>Passing</i>, in Irene's "Encounter" with Clare Kendry. In <i>Quicksand</i>, at this party Helga's movement toward Denney is interrupted by two men (by the "masculine" that "surrounds" Denney): first, she is intercepted by her old fianc&#x00E9; from Naxos, James Vayle (who waylays her on her way to Denney and who, like Anne, condemns the racial mixing at the party) and then, finally, by Anderson. Exactly at the moment when some of us might be wondering if Helga will meet Audrey Denney, Helga collides physically with Anderson, creating a swoon moment which keeps her from meeting Denney and ultimately leads to her final undoing near the end of the book. It is at the Harlem party that this downfall begins, when Helga steps through a doorway, and  </p>

<p class="continued">Just when Helga begins to face the fact that her "freeing" transatlantic travel is always in some way a return to race; just as she comes to "[t]his knowledge, this certainty of the division in her life into two parts in two lands"; just after she has expressed to James Vayle her lack of interest in marriage and children; and just at the moment when she might approach a "lovely" woman she admires&#x2014;Robert Anderson kisses her (<i>QP</i>, 96). </p>

<p>In Atlantic modernism, such kisses mark the turning point&#x2014;the early twentieth-century, often deflated version of the swoon&#x2014;in the protagonist's transnational voyage 

<b></b>

out, ostensibly into freedom. As Richard Dalloway kisses Rachel Vinrace in <i>The Voyage Out</i>, as Rochester kisses Bertha in <i>Wide Sargosso Sea</i>, as Adele <i>says</i> Aziz kisses her in <i>Passage to India</i>, Anderson's kiss reignites an old tainted history, the Gothic racial and sexual core of the English-language liberty plot. At this crisis, one can fairly hear the ghosts rattling their chains, or see what Rachel Vinrace dreams as the mocking goblins munching in their wet, dark corners, and what Helga calls the "skeletons that stalked lively and in full health through the consciousness of every person of Negro ancestry in America" (<i>QP</i>, 96). These kisses mark the heroine's discovery of her own desire, and they seem to open to her a world of unencumbered transnational freedom; but as it turns out they also constitute the very event that steals her desire and turns it into an experience of violation or ruin&#x2014;and returns her to the racially imbricated order of things. Thus does the novel end with Helga marrying a southern preacher and giving birth to an endless round of children. With this abrupt, unliberating ending, Larsen refuses, like Woolf, to endorse the dream of transatlantic freedom, choosing instead to expose the woman's, and the queer's, drowning within Atlantic, transnational history.  </p>

<p>Like other Atlantic modernists, Larsen and Woolf register in their narrative structures the troubled history of transnational migrations and freedom projects on the Atlantic that have been deadly insofar as they have been racialized and made heteronormative within a modern/colonial order. Their texts can serve to remind us that the transnational aspects of modernism arise not strictly <i>against</i> the current of national or imperial histories, literary or otherwise. Rather, it is exactly by way of the transnational that these authors take up Atlantic history. They narrate their protagonists' ocean-crossing flights as panicked or depressed attempts to escape history, but these travels only return them to the sorrow of history that backs their panes of glass. Jacob Flanders and Helga Crane might hope to exercise the rooted, privileged freedoms conferred on national community members who can <i>thereby </i>travel both out and back over national borders, at will, for pleasure or profit. This, after all, is their proper Atlantic birthright: a transnationalism authorized by the nation. But transnational movement no more than national membership gains them their desires or their freedom. Thus Woolf and Larsen question the freedom promised not only by nations and empires but also specifically by the transnational mobility that constitutes them. As long as transnationalism's promise of freedom operates within the race-reproductive and modern/colonial order, it remains a ruse.  </p>

<p>Perhaps, then, we can think most transformatively, genuinely, and yet also realistically not by positioning liberatory <i>trans</i>national theories against constricting<i> national</i> institutions or ideologies, but rather by always remembering the relation between these two&#x2014;the "trans" and the "national." We might wonder whether the deconstruction of the modernity/coloniality formation might be fostered by the notion of a more interactive, dialectical relation between the national and the transnational. Given that the nation is still the only available apparatus within which most persons and collectivities vote and defend rights, even if within it they are also always at risk of losing rights, perhaps the goal of transnational thinking should not be strictly to deconstruct, supercede, or get free of the nation but rather to queer its history, avow its suppressed stories, and 

<b></b>

accept it as one of multiple venues of collective struggle. Creating narrative breaks where we expect freedom and closure, placing falls where we expect rises, tracing queer desire when we expect indifference, and, finally, making transnationalism part of the raced nation's story, many Atlantic modernists forecast the need for this flexible and complex vision. Their dredging up of an overpowering Atlantic sorrow and their very acknowledgment of a disavowed transnational past could be one step toward the imagining of a deracialized, collective, national and transnational future.  </p>

Like the other geomodernisms discussed in that collection, Atlantic modernism as I am discussing it here is self-consciously "placed," that is, situated (critically, anxiously, or otherwise) in the modern/colonial network, exactly so as to reconre the subjectivities within its geopolitical systems, especially as they are marked by race.

Ioanna Laliotou's <i>Transatlantic Subjects: Acts of Migration and Cultures of Transnationalism between Greece and America </i>(Chicago, Ill.: University of Chicago, 2004) wonderfully models an account of transnationalism that, for instance, places it in inextricable relation to the history of nationalism and migration; in her analysis, transnational migrations and identities provide what she calls a "dangerous supplement to" discourses of modernity and nationalism.

In saying so I do not mean to contribute to any theory that casts the United States as a postcolonial nation, an idea I find unconvincing, especially insofar as it distorts the spirit if not the letter of the term "postcolonial."

<p><a name="FOOT43" href="#REF43">43</a>. Instead of choosing to see this reenactment in Woolf as <i>either</i> a troubled repetition of this history <i>or</i> as a conscious critique of it, I suggest that it is both. When Woolf invokes images of "barbarian men," which appear throughout her fiction, she is both expressing and critiquing a fear. In particular, the fact that these res take on characteristics that recall her own memories of sexual violation at the hands of a stepbrother indicates the ways that this fear carries the interconnected histories of gender and transnational freedom plots. In "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf's memory of Gerald Duckworth's molestations are closely associated with "a horrible face&#x2014;the face of an animal," the latter phrase echoing verbatim her description of the squatting man of whom Rachel dreams (<i>VO</i>, 69). Woolf allows her own trauma to find expression within Rachel's colonialist imagery. See Louise Desalvo, for full consideration of the effects of sexual abuse on Woolf's life and fiction. For more literary discussion of this dimension of Woolf's imagination and in particular as it pervades this novel (though not in relation to colonialist imagery), see <i>Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on her Life and Work</i> (Boston: Beacon, 1989); Jen Shelton, "Don't Say Such Foolish Things, Dear': Speaking Incest in The Voyage Out," <i>Incest and the Literary Imagination</i>, ed.

<div class="fn">
<p>At the same time, as I argue in the book, without wholly escaping her own fears and investments, Woolf in several ways calls attention to the fact that these images are <i>re</i>presentations. My understanding of this double impulse in Woolf is most in accord with that of Robin Hackett in her reading of the links between imperialism and lesbianism in <i>The Waves</i>. Hackett sees imperialist imagery as "one aspect of the structure of Woolf's own imagination" (<i>Sapphic Primitivism</i>, 61). </p>
