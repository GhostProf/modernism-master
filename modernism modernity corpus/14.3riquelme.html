<p>My goal is to bring out the negativity in a characteristic stance toward authenticity among writers of the long twentieth century. That stance typically involves three moments: first, an evocation of wrongheaded attitudes and behavior that present themselves as authentic (true, pure, natural, and the like); often the attitudes are refused (or refuted); if they are accepted, it turns out that they would better have been refused; second, an evocation of an alternative that appears to be itself authentic, or at least preferable; finally, a self-correcting stance that recognizes the alternative as itself not authentic in any absolute, static sense but in need of being part of a process that does not replicate the refused ostensible antitype. The self-correcting stance can include the antiessentializing recognition that Roland Barthes 

<b></b>

 presents as knowing our own mortality, our situation in a historical process that will displace us.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Or we can think of the three moments as representing what Homi Bhabha and Judith Butler might agree is a shift from the pedagogical to the performative, a shift that recognizes the possibility of the performative lapsing into the pedagogical and of the pedagogical persisting even in attempts to reject its specific forms. Modernist negativity displaces the pedagogical, at times through a self-correcting, self-transforming merger of the aesthetic and the political. In that merger, the embodied, historical, fallible dimension of human experience becomes a basis for making defensible choices about values and actions.  </p>

<p>I had planned to focus in my paper on Oscar Wilde's notion of lying as one crucial origin for the process by which modernist authenticity rejects (and corrects) conventional, institutionalized, essentializing attitudes without itself becoming totalizing. For reasons of space, efficiency, and (primarily) compulsion, my paper wrote itself mostly about Yeats and briefly about Bob Dylan, specifically "Fergus and the Druid"  and "The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest" . There is no intention, or possibility, of overlaying these texts absolutely, but each gives us a version of a process involving literarily a dialogical, actually polylogical, situation in which apparently opposing perspectives are taken up into a potentially self-correcting dynamic that is represented or otherwise evoked. In sum: in this model, the modernist critique of authenticity involves a negative moment of corrective rejection followed by a further different kind of negativity that recognizes the corrective rejection's inevitable eventual lapse into bad faith (or ideological delusion, or inauthenticity). Among the many omissions below: no sustained exploration of androgyny as a relevant gendered dialogical form or of the complicated refusal in literary modernity of the cultural denial of death and the related technological imperative to master nature. Androgyny's relevance to the scheme is evident in Virginia Woolf's comments on gender and identity in chapter six of <i>A Room of One's Own</i> . There her swerve from the constrictive masculine "I" of some male writers (and of Italian Fascism) is not a turn toward a singularly gendered female identity; instead of the latter, which Woolf warns against, she turns to androgyny, a mixed state presumably involving unpredictable interactions within a process of emergence, as in Fanon's third stage of postcolonial nation building mentioned below. </p>

<p>The inherent fluctuations, or oscillating perspectives, of modernist negativity that I argue for in Yeats, Dylan, and Wilde occur as well in modern painting. Primed by Roger Rothman's paper on Salvador Dalí, our discussion began bringing out the connections. A move away from positive knowledge occurs in avant-garde painting, as well as in the writing I discussed. Magritte and Duchamp deserve consideration, along with Dalí. Of particular relevance is Magritte's famous series of paintings that simulate pipes along with the hand-written sentence, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."  </p>

<p>Evoking the difference between the material object and its apparent representation by means of the negative assertion, Magritte goes beyond the mere unmasking of visual illusion by introducing writing's mediations into the ostensible immediacy of visual perception. The unsettling effects emerge in a process that is cognate with the 

<b></b>

 unfolding of modernist authenticity in stages as I describe it below. The oscillations set up by the paintings can be understood with reference to Wilde's mention of the Cretan Liar in "The Decay of Lying," the paradoxical relations between voice and writing in modernist dialogues starting with Wilde, the simulacrum understood as a lie that stages a truth about experience, the aesthetics of the counterfeit (as developed by Hugh Kenner in <i>The Counterfeiters</i> [1968]), and the signed soup cans of Andy Warhol. In his monograph, <i>Ceci n'est pas une pipe</i> , Foucault links Magritte's paintings to Warhol's soup cans. Taking the argument in those directions extends to post-Dadaist art, and to key res of literary modernism, Walter Benjamin's claim in "Author as Producer" that "The revolutionary strength of Dadaism lay in testing art for its authenticity."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The testing for authenticity goes on before and after Dada and Surrealism, in Yeats's writing, in Dylan's, and elsewhere during the long twentieth century. The pseudonymous "Bob Dylan," that musically shape-changing re who turned himself into a pop star over the objections of his folk music fans, shares with Yeats's Fergus a resolute determination not to be a character in someone else's dream. As David Shumway rightly points out in his contribution, "Dylan has repeatedly refashioned himself, always giving the impression that the new Dylan is at least <i>an</i> authentic Dylan." Yeats's character and Dylan's persona are comparable, despite the fact that Dylan's work emerges at a later stage of commodity culture. Both writers face related risks of acceding to social pressures. Both project the dangers, along with possible responses involving self-correcting, self-transforming processes of refusal. 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>In "Fergus and the Druid," Fergus answers the Druid's question about what he wants by expressing his discomfort and desire. He wishes to: "Be no more a king / But learn the dreaming wisdom that is yours."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  His answer is based on a belief that he can avoid being "but a foolish labourer / Who wastes his blood to be another's dream" ("FD," ll.28–29). Finding the role prescribed for him as ruler constricting, Fergus has abdicated by running off to the woods, where he opens, against the advice of the Druid, the bag that releases an uncontrollable multiplicity into his experience. The result brings not happiness but something negative: "But now I have grown nothing, knowing all. / Ah! Druid, Druid, how great webs of sorrow / Lay hidden in the small slate-coloured thing!" ("FD," ll.38–40). Fergus has the final word in the poem, but it is not definitive, except in so far as it raises questions rather than confirming his own answer. That is, Fergus is not Yeats's spokesperson. He is not a persona to be identified with the poet either here or in the other well-known poem about him, "Who goes with Fergus?" Empson placed the latter poem in category six of his seven types of ambiguity, identifying it as a kind of literary hurricane. The style that Empson notes early in Yeats's career, also evident in the dialogue form that Yeats refines over decades, embodies literarily the self-correcting aspect of the modernist critique of authenticity, including its own. Because Fergus in the dialogue poem is only one participant (though his style changes in the final stanza), not <i>the</i> voice of the poem, what he says and how he speaks are in dialogue with other elements and styles (the pressures of his people; the views of the Druid; the composite style of the dialogue in which he appears). As in "Who goes with Fergus?", the result is a question, or a process of questioning, that can yield various answers and perspectives. </p>

<p>Yeats evokes the issue of authenticity for himself and his character, who become comparable, but not merged, in related processes involving refusal and the experience of a potentially vertiginous, uncontrollable multiplicity that cannot be ignored or suppressed. The following several elements, all involving negation, combine to connect poet to character: </p>

<p>1. The poem's situation focuses on a re refusing to read the lines of a script provided by social convention. Fergus can stand in this regard for an array of characters and personae (many linked to the artist in some way) during the long twentieth century who say "no": including Hardy's poetic persona in his last poem and elsewhere, Wilde's Salomé, Stephen Dedalus, the Irish rebels of "Easter 1916," Dr. Aziz in <i>A Passage to India</i>, Mrs. Ramsay in <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, Thomas Sutpen, his children, and Quentin Compson in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, Toni Morrison's Sula, and some of Beckett's personae. These res cannot be reduced to a single shape, but they do have in common a noteworthy refusal that is one moment of modernist negativity responding to pressures to conform. </p>

<p>2. Yeats refuses in this work (and elsewhere) to rely on conventional mythic resources, including classical myth (which appears in some of his later works) and English national mythology. Fergus does not fit comfortably among either Homeric or Arthurian mythic res. Yeats says "no" to both traditions (and to English and European hegemony and expectations) by drawing instead on his own versions of Celtic myth. This political act 

<b></b>

 involves the poet's relation to <i>nation</i>, a relation that can be described with reference to Fanon's three stages of developing a postcolonial identity. For Fanon, nation building moves through stages of accepting and refusing foreign ways before reaching a "zone of occult instability" that enables something new to develop as an authentic nation.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Yeats contributed to bringing Irish mythology and an Irish nation to birth, not to recovering an authentic home that had once existed. He committed himself to helping write the history of the future for the Irish nation.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>   </p>

<p>3. Both stylistically and conceptually, Yeats refuses the lyric persona whose name in English is "I" by writing dialogical poetry that here happens to be literally a dialogue. The post-Romantic Irish writer is saying "no" to the English lyric tradition and to "I" as an adequate, that is, an authentic, name. </p>

<p>4. The poem evokes, beyond specific refusals and determinate acts of negative rejection or positive acceptance, a disruptive multiplicity, represented by the bag (reducible neither to Pandora's box nor to Aeolus's bag of winds, aspects of classical myth that leave hierarchies of power involving gender and social position in place). The effects of opening the bag can stand for the multiply framing, polyvocal tendencies of modernist literary discourse, whose ambivalences resist being reduced easily to a dominating, essentializing discourse. The multiplicity provides no single direction or set of directions for reaching home, lyric I, or the myths and styles that try to define the limits of meaning, value, and behavior.  </p>

<p>For shorthand, and as part of a refusal to forget Bob Dylan's refusal to be himself or to be anyone else's spokesperson, I group these and related aspects of Yeats's modernist negativity under the rubric "no direction home," from Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone" (used by Martin Scorsese as the title for his 2005 documentary). The phrase responds to pressures to conform, that is, to be authentic in prescribed ways with regard to social position, national myths, gender, selfhood, literary form, and even (particularly) logical coherence. Dylan's phrase suggests the condition of being homeless (a condition that can be more authentic and revealing than thinking you know what or where home is), and of being more, that is, less than homeless, a Beckettian lessness that is directionless about home through some indeterminate combination of refusal and incapacity.  </p>

<p>The pattern I discern in Yeats appears in varying truncated or otherwise modified forms in other writers and works, including Dylan's "Ballad": away from a socially defined role, home, self, and discourse toward a negating alternative that cannot become a place of rest (it's just a house, not a home, and definitely not Paradise, whatever we might want to think), lest it become itself in its turn a static, pre-scripted, limiting shape. The disruptive multiplicity creates continuing uncertainties and instabilities that keep the experience of role, home, self, and discourse sufficiently out of the territory of positive knowledge and unalloyed acceptance to turn all those elements into the names of questions. In Dylan's song, the dynamic, performative questioning of authenticity involves the interplay of negative language and reversals of language. These give rise to a fluctuating response that is unlikely to accept the "moral" formulated in the song's closing. The song's language expresses undulations and reversals particularly vividly in the exchange between Frankie Lee and Judas Priest about "house" and "home": <b></b></p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"What kind of house is this," he said,<br />
"Where I have come to roam?"<br />
"It's not a house," said Judas Priest,<br />
"It's not a house . . . it's a home."</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




 

<p class="continued">Coming (in order) "to roam" is an unexpected, unsettling locution, since it suggests ambiguously in context that Frankie Lee's roaming has come to an end at the house. The phrasing reverses the more direct and understandable <i>roaming to come</i> (home, or to the house). Instead of a destination, this house that isn't a house may represent the continuation of roaming (he's come there "to roam") or even the start of a new kind of wandering. Judas Priest's repeated negative assertion concerning house and home is taken further in the negative language of the song's closing "moral": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Well, the moral of the story,<br />
The moral of this song,<br />
Is simply that one should never be<br />
Where one does not belong.<br />
. . .<br />
And don't go mistaking Paradise<br />
For that home across the road.</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The emphatic negative repetition of "never," "not," "don't," and "mistaking" push hard in an apparently univocal way. But the putative distinction between "Paradise" and "home" repeats in a new vein the distinction between "house" and "home." As in the earlier passage, there is an unsettling reversal in the phrasing, which we could reasonably expect to be <i>mistaking that home across the road for Paradise</i>, rather than vice versa. The effect of didactically expressing the "moral" in negative terms and oddly reversed phrasing is arguably to generate resistance and uncertainty in the reader rather than acceptance. The heavy-handed character of the didactic moment produces an antipedagogical effect in our response, which is performative because of the negations and reversals. The song's language generates a dissonance within an assertion that, for Yeats's Fergus or anyone else who lacks a sense of belonging, makes the conceptual link in the rhyming of "home" with "roam" definitive. </p>

<p>Yeats's early poem has been central to this meditation, but the refusal of a stabilizing identity there and the impetus toward enabling future refusals that cannot be mapped in advance constitute together a nameless, unnamable direction and a directionless homing that are visible earlier and later in writers important for understanding literary modernity: ". . . no things but nameless things, no names but thingless names."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Dialogic literary form in the literal shape of dialogues has a significant origin in Wilde, whose twin concepts of lying and masking inform the literary modernity of writers in the long twentieth century. Wilde develops lying conceptually and aesthetically in "The Decay of Lying" as a memorable alternative to the distortions of self-proclaimed, self-congratulatory truth, realism, disinterested historical objectivity and accuracy, and morality; it makes the Cretan Liar, who may well turn out to be Irish, black, female, 

<b></b>

 or gay, an alternative to the Victorian sage. Lying embodies what Wilde calls in <i>Intentions</i> the truth of masks, the notion that "a Truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  With that Wildean compass, or its equivalent of their own modification or invention, Hardy, Yeats, Woolf, Ellison, Beckett, Heaney, Morrison, among others, and their readers are in less danger than they otherwise would be of thinking we've found Paradise, when the "home" across the road is really only a house. In this authentically modernist universe, all directions lead to roam.  </p>

I wish to thank Marie-Anne Verougstraete for her rendering of René Magritte's famous word picture, <i>La trahison des images</i>, which he produced and alluded to in numerous versions and variations in his paintings and drawings from the 1920s to the 1960s. Magritte's representation of the pipe that is not a pipe is the best-known visual meditation of the twentieth century on the enigmatic relations of art to truth and lying. As Magritte is reported to have remarked, ". . . if I had written on my picture 'This is a pipe,' I'd have been lying!" (reported by Claude Vial, "<i>Ceci n'est pas René Magritte</i>," <i>Femmes d'Aujourd'hui</i> (July 6, 1966): 22–24). As do Warhol's repeated images and signed objects, Magritte's multiple versions raise the issue of the counterfeit in modern aesthetic practice.  </p>

<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>. During the seminar, the question arose concerning the extent to which Yeats believed in the authenticity of the Celtic myths that inform his writing. The pattern I have outlined provides a basis for responding. By choosing Fergus, Yeats finds an alternative for aspects of British culture that are inauthentic for the Irish. He discovered and collected Irish myths and folk narratives, rather than simply inventing them, but they emerge explicitly as res, rather than found, unchanging realities, in his later poetry. This is the case in the middle section of "The Circus Animals' Desertion," where "'The Countess Cathleen'" is "the name I gave" to "a counter-truth," and Cuchulain is part of a "dream," one of the "Players." Yeats moves past the adducing of "counter-truth" in, among other ways, the fusing of Irish myth and non-Western forms and perspectives in his memorable plays influenced by the Japanese Noh tradition. The rejection of a British embodiment is still evident, but the Irish res have been taken up into a surprising transformational process. David Shumway claims that "Yeats found" authenticity "in Celtic mythology." Although that may have been the case early in his career, Yeats's writings include prominently a fully modernist version of authenticity.  </p>
