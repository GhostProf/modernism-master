<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  Using the careers of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein as examples, this article examines the creation of literary celebrity in the early twentieth century as a complex recursive process that involves authorial actions, the production of specific works, the promotion of texts and their authors, and audience reception. It ultimately contends that a more thorough exploration of this process can help scholars gain a better understanding of both the vocational sphere of authorship at the turn of the twentieth century and the texts produced at that time.

<div id="body">
<p>
      When F. Scott Fitzgerald submitted what would become his first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>, to Scribner’s for the third time in late 1919, young editor Maxwell Perkins had to deliver an impassioned speech to the board, effectively resigning over the book’s repeated dismissal, before <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span> was finally accepted for publication.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Fitzgerald had only one story published in a major commercial magazine at this point in his career and was largely unknown outside the coterie of literary friends he had made during his undergraduate years at Princeton. Within a year, the novel became an essential text for many teenagers in the United States and Fitzgerald was heralded as the voice of the younger generation.
    </p>
<p>
      Gertrude Stein labored for nearly three decades to find a major publisher for her output, labored, that is, until writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> in the fall of 1932. Much like <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span>, this book was an immediate success. After excerpts appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography</span> sold its entire first printing, more than 5,000 copies, nine days in advance of its official publication date.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The immense popularity Stein achieved as a result of the book allowed her to begin publishing pieces from her massive collection of manuscripts. It also laid the groundwork for a successful tour of the United States in 1934. Stein’s trip from France was front-page news in nearly every New York newspaper and she was surrounded by interviewers and curiosity-seekers the moment she stepped off the boat.
    </p>
<p>
      While such stories of near-immediate national renown might seem commonplace today, the speed with which Fitzgerald’s and Stein’s names traveled across a continent and the extensive  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> opportunities that fame afforded them were relatively new phenomena in the early decades of the twentieth century. These phenomena were made possible, in turn, by the massive restructuring of the U.S. cultural landscape in the late nineteenth century. The rapid development of new resources and technologies that have come to be lumped under the general term “modernity” brought many people physically and imaginatively closer together. They also gave rise to processes that enabled the widespread consumption of relatively homogeneous products and messages. Thus, F. Scott Fitzgerald, three weeks after the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span>, could script an “interview” with himself and send it to his publishers in hopes that it might be reprinted simultaneously in newspapers, literary inserts, and book reviews around the country. He could, for the first time in history, anticipate submitting his opinions almost immediately to millions of contemporary readers across the continental United States.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity and Modernist Studies</h1>
<p>
	The early twentieth century has been studied extensively by celebrity scholars.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Part of the reason this period has received so much attention is because it marks both the first appearance of independent public relations firms and the film industry’s earliest forays into star promotion. For all the consideration that has been given to these significant developments, more attention needs to be paid to the complex interrelations between U.S. print and celebrity cultures at the time.
      </p>
<p>
	Newspapers and magazines began to reach national audiences during the last decades of the nineteenth century. This development helped to lay the groundwork for the sophisticated publicity campaigns of the 1910s and 1920s. It also encouraged national conversations about literature, conversations that became an important part of most major news publications in the early twentieth century. The increasing amount of space devoted to texts meant that columnists and writers kept a close eye on literary developments and almost any event or interesting detail could receive mention. Literary supplements, which provided a direct source of information about books and authors, became more popular as well. Inserts like the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> literary section expanded early in the century to meet the increased demand for such information and several prominent reviews were formed shortly thereafter. Both the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Herald Tribune’s Books</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Review of Literature</span> first appeared in the 1920s.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Gossip columns and literary reviews were so important in the years after the First World War that press agents who could develop relationships with columnists, and occasionally influence copy, often received significant advances for their services.
      </p>
<p>
	Beyond promoting conversations about literature, national media outlets provided authors with new channels for constructing public personae and they allowed writers to communicate rapidly with audiences all around the country. Conversely, readers’ engagements with literary texts were increasingly mediated by new sources of information about books and authors. Audiences also had greater access to writers after the turn of the twentieth century as book tours, promotional appearances, and public lectures became more common.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Critics early in the century often ignored or downplayed the importance of these complex engagements, particularly in connection with certain types of “literary” texts. One obvious reason for this attitude is that some authors at the time reacted to the increasing interpenetration of business and art by positioning themselves, at least nominally, in opposition to the market. Both F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, for instance, often attributed economic rather than aesthetic motivations to pieces of writing when they wanted to speak dismissively of them. Fitzgerald regularly disparaged his short story writing by describing it as a means of support for his “real” work, crafting novels. In one interview given in 1927, the year after he published his short story collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">All the Sad Young Men</span>, Fitzgerald said, “I keep myself pure in regard to my novels. I have written only three of them. Each one takes two or three years. Of course, there are my short stories--but, then, you have to live.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Stein similarly distinguished between what she referred to as her “moneymaking style,” and her “really creative one.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> She invoked this distinction most frequently in the mid-1930s, as a way of differentiating between her accessible and immensely popular memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>, and her often obscure experimental writings.
      </p>
<p>
	Distinctions like these led some early scholars of modernist literature to propose that a select subset of authors strove to operate beyond the reaches of the marketplace or at least to create texts that were untainted by commercial impulses. While this extreme generalization can still be found in criticism today, many contemporary scholars, attentive to postmodern critiques of totalizing systems and poststructural disruptions of binary oppositions, have been highly critical of efforts to set “high” art in opposition to the mass market. Most critics reflecting on this shift, in what is now a well-worn story of the historical development of modernist studies, claim that the transformative re was Fredric Jameson. Jameson, in his widely-cited article, “Reification and Utopia in Mass Culture,” proposes that high culture and mass culture are interrelated and can only be understood through a historical analysis of their joint emergence under the conditions of capitalism.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> While some scholars have expressed unease with the wide acceptance of such a simplistic and linear narrative,<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> few would deny either the influence of Jameson’s work or the transformative effect that materialist critical approaches have had in the sphere of what is now called modernist studies. The last three decades have seen an explosion of volumes examining the various ways in which canonical authors, despite their occasionally dismissive rhetoric, have engaged with and been implicated in the marketplace.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Much as this work has complicated the traditional opposition between high culture and the mass market, many important developments continue to be subsumed into the more general operations of the marketplace. The increased cultural emphasis on celebrity personae in the early twentieth century is one area that needs more consideration. By the 1920s, there were enough products devoted to disseminating the images of, and information about, celebrities, from fan magazines to gossip columns to trading cards, that many historians and cultural scholars have unreflexively referred to the existence of a distinct “celebrity culture” during the era. Yet in Douglas Mao and Rebecca L. Walkowitz’s recent survey of studies devoted to “the marketing of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> modernism” in <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span>, celebrity did not even merit a mention.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> While this omission does not necessarily reflect a lack of interest in the topic, it does suggest the relatively unsystematic nature of contemporary approaches to literary celebrity. Much of the work in this area has emerged from studies of individual authors, either through close readings that examine the ways in which a particular re treated the subject of fame or surveys that explore how an author cultivated his or her persona. A relatively small number of texts focus on specific periods and even fewer pursue a general understanding of literary celebrity at a particular historical moment.
      </p>
<p>
	The following analyses lay the foundation for the latter kind of project by examining the creation of literary celebrity in the early twentieth century as a complex recursive process that involves authorial actions, the production of specific works, the promotion of texts and their authors, and audience reception. Subsequent sections briefly examine each of these forms of activity in order to demonstrate the impact that they could have on the image and reputation of writers. By emphasizing the potential effects that a wide range of res had on the production of authorial personae, this study seeks to complicate unreflexive conceptions that re a writer’s reputation as a static object readily discerned through the analysis of specific literary or critical works. In the increasingly media-saturated environment of the early twentieth century, public renown seems more usefully approached as the function of a dynamic process, a contested value that is continually renegotiated in multiple contexts by stars, fans, and a wide range of intermediary res.
      </p>
<p>
	To help contain my discussion of these issues, I will continue to use F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein as the primary examples in my analysis. I have chosen these two authors because they represent, by contemporary standards, “oppositional” career paths. F. Scott Fitzgerald received national recognition with the publication of his first novel and spent much of the next two decades struggling for critical respectability while writing for smaller and smaller audiences. Conversely, Stein spent decades generating cultural capital and cultivating relationships with influential patrons in the hopes of finding a publisher for her large collection of manuscripts. It was not until she was in her sixties, with a best-selling memoir to her credit, that she was finally able to secure a long-term publishing arrangement with Random House. Despite these different paths, both authors regularly engaged in self-fashioning efforts designed to influence responses to their work. Moreover, Stein and Fitzgerald shared a remarkably similar set of concerns about the potential effects such efforts might have on their reputations. In short, by focusing on the careers of these two res, I hope to illuminate the impact that celebrity media could have on authors regardless of their perceived ‘brow’ level or their cultural aspirations.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity and Textual Reception</h1>
<p>
	Many studies of the modern marketplace suggest the relevance that a systematic analysis of celebrity would have for the field as a whole, from Jennifer Wicke’s work on the dialectical relationship between advertising discourse and literature to Lawrence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Rainey’s examination of the material conditions underwriting modernist textual production. Rainey’s study in particular foregrounds the new strategies of authorial self-construction necessitated by economic and cultural developments in the early twentieth century. What these and many other works suggest, on the most general level, is that celebrity discourse, even in the earliest decades of the twentieth century, functioned as an important site for constructing meanings around texts.
      </p>
<p>
	Part of the reason this point has not been made more forcefully by scholars is that it stands in direct opposition to conventional theorizations of modernist textuality. Aaron Jaffe usefully elaborates these ideas in his study of modernist literature’s “promotional logic.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Jaffe argues that avant-garde writers were not removed from the scene of the mass market, but instead instantiated themselves indirectly in it by creating literary objects that bear a specific “stylistic stamp.” This stamp, or “imprimatur,” served the dual purpose of distinguishing a text from others in the marketplace and of sanctioning that text, particularly as the specific name attached to it began to accumulate value in the literary sphere. The endpoint of this “logic,” then, is that modernist authors successfully operated in the marketplace by turning themselves into “formal artifact[s].”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Jaffe’s book provides a useful account of one way in which writers accumulated cultural capital while at times remaining overtly opposed to the market. His focus on this particular form of “promotional logic,” however, moves his study away from any direct evaluation of the influential publicity efforts that such a logic dismisses as secondary. It would be difficult to argue, for instance, that T. S. Eliot, a major re in Jaffe’s study, gave public lectures in order to promote himself as a formally dispersed textual object, even though, as Jaffe would assert, both Eliot and the New Critics would have considered any publicity generated by the lectures irrelevant to the study of Eliot’s work. It is in part by dismissing these activities and focusing attention on the “masterpiece,” theorized as an autonomous repository of literary value, that many authors and critics were able to cultivate an air of objectivity and supposedly insulate their work from the corrupting influence of promotional activities.
      </p>
<p>
	One important consequence of these theories is that they help to deter questions about the potential influence marketing efforts could have on readers and critics. A brief look at the publicity surrounding F. Scott Fitzgerald in the early 1920s will demonstrate how useful such an analysis can be. Initially, Fitzgerald was promoted as both a brilliant writer and a representative example of the impetuous young adults that populated his early work. Advertisements, interviews, and Fitzgerald’s own autobiographical essays all emphasized his youth, his fast-paced lifestyle, and his literary talents. Over the next few years, as Fitzgerald’s antics kept his face in the newspapers and reinforced his image as a debauched young man, many of the articles written by and about him reiterated other aspects of his persona. Fitzgerald himself was quite fond of emphasizing how effortlessly he produced his popular stories. In one piece, Fitzgerald uses his experience writing the short story “The Ice Palace” to explain his “theory that, except in a certain sort of naturalistic realism, what you enjoy writing [and thus write quickly] is liable to be much better reading than what you labor over.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> In another autobiographical article, he implicitly applies this theory to all of his early short stories, claiming, “the quickest [was] written in an hour and a half, the slowest in three days.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	The success of this powerful media campaign can be seen in highbrow critics’ responses to Fitzgerald’s first two novels. Reactions to <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>  were incredibly diverse in tone and content, ranging from the lavish praise of H. L. Mencken, who calls the book “a truly amazing first novel--original in structure, extremely sophisticated in manner, and adorned with . . . brilliancy,” to the ambivalence of R.V.A.S., who applauds <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span> as “fundamentally honest,” but finds “the intellectual and spiritual analyses . . . sometimes tortuous and the nomenclature bewildering.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> By the time <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span> was published in March 1922, however, many highbrow critics had reached a consensus about Fitzgerald’s work: the always-lively Fitzgerald certainly had talent, but he had not worked hard enough to master his abilities.
      </p>
<p>
	Gilbert Seldes, writing in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dial</span>, asserts that Fitzgerald’s flippant attitude towards art overrides his considerable skill as a writer and severely damages the book.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Similarly, Henry Beston, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, writes, “The present endeavor marks no advance [over <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>] in either method or philosophy of life,” though “the book is alive, very much alive.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> John Peale Bishop, an established poet and friend, wrote a particularly scathing review of the book in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Herald</span>. Bishop begins by claiming that the protagonist, Anthony Patch, is “a re through whom Mr. Fitzgerald may write of himself,” and then launches into a series of attacks on Patch/Fitzgerald, mentioning, among other problems, his “inherent laziness” and his “illusion that he is rather superior in intellect and character to the persons about him.” This belief, however, is not true according to Bishop because Patch/Fitzgerald is merely the sort of man who “spent his time among many books without deriving from them either erudition or richness of mind.” Finally, after listing a series of more general problems with the book, he concludes, “these are flaws of vulgarity in one who is awkward with his own vigor.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The uniformity of these reviews is startling, especially given the wide variety of responses to <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>. In just two short years, this particular group of critics, many of whom railed against the ever-expanding celebrity media outlets and bemoaned the credulity of undereducated audiences, had come to an implicit consensus about Fitzgerald based in part on his media-generated persona.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The only significant difference between Fitzgerald’s self-presentation and reviewers’ depictions of the author was the standard they used to assess his persona. These critics all seemed to agree that Fitzgerald did, as he repeatedly claimed, have a natural talent for writing. Yet, for men who used education and an aura of sophistication to garner both cultural and financial capital, Fitzgerald’s supposed gift was not something, in and of itself, worthy of praise. They valued instead the industrious learning and knowledge of tradition that set them apart from more popular and, in some circles, less respected writers. Fitzgerald’s public disdain for just such labor, then, is precisely what prevents his work from being considered “True Literature,” a title that highbrow critics considered themselves uniquely able to confer.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Critics, of course, were not the only ones influenced by such large and sophisticated marketing campaigns. Knowledge of public personae could help to guide general readers’ interpretations of texts and, in more extreme cases, could even be said to replace  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the need to read altogether. Janice Radway has demonstrated how some texts in the 1910s and 1920s were promoted as objects of knowledge rather than as literary works that contained inherent value. Thus, educated middle-class readers who were anxious about remaining “current” could potentially reap social benefits by knowing about the currently fashionable literary titles rather than actually reading them.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Similarly, authorial personae functioned as an important site of knowledge production that could ultimately displace the texts upon which a writer’s fame supposedly rested. For instance, when Gertrude Stein came to the United States for a lecture tour in 1934, newspapers tracked her movements and some of the major papers even ran extended commentaries on the trip. Yet the focus was rarely on Stein’s writing or the content of her speeches, which had at least nominally occasioned the notices in the first place. Her clothes, her demeanor, and her effect on audiences regularly took precedence. (<span style="font-style:italic;">For more on Stein’s lecture tour, particularly her time in Chicago, see Liesl Olson’s article in this issue.</span>)
      </p>
<p>
	In addition, while people came in surprising numbers to hear Stein’s lectures, very few of them demonstrated a desire to learn more about Stein’s ideas. In one oft-told story, the author fired her tour organizer, Marvin Ross, shortly after arriving in the United States because over 1,700 people had tickets for one of her opening lectures at Columbia University, far more that the five-hundred-person limit she had specified. The transcripts of her talks, however, subsequently published as <span style="font-style:italic;">Lectures in America</span>, sold poorly. In other words, this bold and mysterious woman who had long been a topic of conversation in the American press, gaining such nicknames as the Mama of Dada, Mother Goose of Montparnasse, the high-priestess of the Left Bank, the Mother of Modernism, and the queen bee of the expatriate hive, had managed to generate a significant amount of interest in her appearances without drawing audiences to her ideas. At the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, Stein’s memoir about the lecture tour, she explains this phenomena to her publisher, Alfred Harcourt: “Harcourt was very surprised when I said to him on first meeting him in New York remember this extraordinary welcome that I am having does not come from the books of mine that they do understand like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> but the books of mine that they did not understand.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity, Textual Production, and Promotion</h1>
<p>
	One danger of focusing on the reception of texts is that it often leads critics to oversimplify the production process and place an inordinate emphasis on the agency of particular individuals. It would not be difficult, for instance, to take Stein’s quote as an indication that her difficult texts were conceived as part of a larger effort to convince readers that she was, as she so often claimed to be, a “genius.” By extension, the high/low aesthetic divide can seem like little more than a tactical move perpetrated by authors trying to find a space in a thoroughly commodified literary marketplace. The complexity of a text certainly did have an impact on the way writers were categorized by readers; moreover, writers of all dispositions did attempt to shape the way they  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> were perceived by audiences. The efforts of individual authors, however, always exist within, even as they contribute to the formation of, a complex system of institutions and practices. The image of Stein that appeared in conjunction with the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>, for instance, was noticeably affected by the prevailing conditions in the publishing industry, a field which had long struggled with the gradual commodification of literary texts.
      </p>
<p>
	As business and art became increasingly intermingled in the emerging consumer culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many publishers remained committed to the idea that art could possess an inherent, and transcendent, value not dictated by the operations of the marketplace. George Doran, for instance, an early partner of Frank Doubleday, often complained that good literature could not be successfully promoted. By the mid-1930s, when even “high” modernist authors like Joyce and Stein had published best-sellers after notable publicity campaigns, Doran ruefully commented in his memoirs, “the great profession of publishing has measurably degenerated into a business of mass production where each highly enterprising publisher of the era seeks by advertisement and other ultra-modern methods to outsell his contemporaries.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Doran’s fear that advertising led directly to the degradation of literature was not uncommon at the time. Henry Holt, for instance, had made a similar complaint thirty years earlier in a review of Walter Hines Page’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Publisher’s Confession</span>: “Books are not bricks, and . . . the more they are treated as bricks, the more they tend to become bricks.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
	If the U.S.’s emergent consumer culture was already a concern for some established publishers at the turn of the twentieth century, the situation became far more problematic for those who attempted to form new houses in subsequent decades. Catherine Turner has demonstrated how, during the 1910s and 1920s, Donald Brace, Bennett Cerf, Alfred Harcourt, Donald Klopfer, Alfred Knopf, and Horace Liveright were all forced to mediate between the increasingly complex demands of an intensely competitive literary marketplace and the genteel notions of traditional publishing houses. A new firm could secure its reputation by supporting “quality” literature, that is, texts whose value did not, at least in theory, depend on sales. Yet, to remain competitive, the new firms had to employ the latest marketing techniques in order to promote both themselves and their books.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The contradictions that arose from such a position are readily apparent in Alfred Harcourt’s massive publicity campaign for Gertrude Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>. Advertisements appeared in all of the major literary supplements proclaiming Stein’s role as an “eminent American woman” at the forefront of contemporary artistic production. She had, many ads proclaimed, the knowledge to explain “why modern literature <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span>.” By implicitly constructing “modern literature” as something difficult, a phenomenon that needs explicating, Harcourt could draw on Stein’s reputation as an avant-garde author as well as on the gradually accumulating cultural capital of “modern literature.” Yet the ads also emphasize the readability of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography</span> and its sheer entertainment value. This memoir will be, the ads promise, both a major part of modern literature and a straightforward guide to the rarefied world of high art.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Such an advertising campaign reveals the complex interrelation of public personae, market conditions, and aesthetic theory in the early decades of the twentieth century. It also suggests how many different res in the book industry helped to shape the images that emerged before the public. While interactions among publishers, editors, and authors have been explored at some length in recent scholarship on the “marketing of modernism,” the impact that these people had on the cultivation of celebrity personae has received relatively little attention. Many other res crucial to the process have also fallen outside the purview of much contemporary scholarship, including literary agents and journalists.
      </p>
<p>
	If the previous example suggests one way that Stein’s image may have been inflected by external forces, Fitzgerald’s attempt to refashion his persona during the 1930s demonstrates how little control writers often had over their own personae. As noted above, Fitzgerald cultivated the image of an impetuous genius during the early years of his career and he was regularly characterized in the press as the voice of a new generation. By the end of the decade, however, Fitzgerald’s situation had radically changed. His alcoholism, on-going problems with <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender is the Night</span>, which would take him the better part of a decade to complete, and troubles with his wife Zelda, who was hospitalized in April 1930 and subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia, all began to take a toll on both the author and his career. Work became increasingly difficult for Fitzgerald and he spent considerably less time in, or seeking to be in, the public eye. In part as a result of these factors, Fitzgerald’s name retained its connection with the Jazz Age long after the Great Depression had redirected both public and literary discourse.

	To counter the perception that he was a washed-up alcoholic, Fitzgerald began consistently adopting the persona of a sober, reflective literary man in his autobiographical writings during the 1930s. “One Hundred False Starts” , a humorous piece detailing the various unfinished projects that fill the author’s notebook, serves as a useful contrast to his earlier pieces. Unlike his articles from the 1920s, which repeatedly emphasize how easy writing is, this article takes as its subject the countless pages the narrator must write or, in the racing metaphor that dominates the piece, the “days and days” he must “crouch” in order to create the mere handful of publishable stories attributed to his name (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 130). The overriding irony of the piece, that is, Fitzgerald’s ultimate ability to take these failures and create a highly amusing story out of them, enhances its humor and helps to undercut the darker implications that could be read into Fitzgerald’s many “false starts.” He appears not as a washed-up alcoholic stuck in a pattern of failure but as a fairly typical writer struggling with the difficulties of his craft. After reiterating that he is “in every sense a professional,” Fitzgerald concludes the piece by praising hard work and the extensive experience, gained through false starts as well as successful writing, necessary to make that work productive (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 131).
      </p>
<p>
	Ultimately, the narrator of “One Hundred False Starts” suggests that this new outlook has changed both the writer himself and the kind of pieces he is capable of writing. One of his notebook entries, “Article: Unattractive Things Girls Do, to pair with counter article by woman,” recalls an earlier set of pieces Fitzgerald did with Zelda for <span style="font-style:italic;">McCall’s</span> in response to the question, “Does a Moment of Revolt Come Sometime to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Every Married Man?” From his current position, the narrator cannot even put the topic into proper perspective and he narrows the title from universal female characteristics to those reflecting “a great majority” of women to “a strong minority.” He finally gives up the article fragment as a remnant of a distant “gilded age,” a decision that takes on even greater significance in light of the fact that the author rarely attempted anything like his earlier pieces in the 1930s (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 128).
      </p>
<p>
	Fitzgerald cultivated this reflective and, perhaps more importantly, sober image throughout much of the decade. His autobiographical writings, his literary commentaries, and even many of his interviews portray a thoughtful and committed artist that stands in sharp contrast to the brash young genius of his early publicity pieces. Despite these fairly consistent efforts, Fitzgerald’s previous image continued to follow him in various forms throughout his life.
      </p>
<p>
	The inability to develop a new persona was not entirely negative for Fitzgerald, in part because his name periodically resurfaced during the Great Depression in popular references to the Jazz Age. If such mentions often ignored his continuing existence and referred only to a handful of early accomplishments, they did help him remain visible to the larger public.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> However remote this success may have seemed, Fitzgerald was still able to cash in on these old associations in his later years. In the summer of 1937, a time when he was regularly earning only $250 for a short story and had made less than $3,500 in six months, Fitzgerald was able to find work as a scriptwriter for MGM at a salary of $1,000 per week. His first job, not surprisingly, was to help patch up the script for <span style="font-style:italic;">A Yank at Oxford</span> , a movie about a young American student in England.
      </p>
<p>
	The flip side of Fitzgerald’s lingering association with the past was that many of his contemporaries dismissed him. As Budd Schulberg, who worked with Fitzgerald on the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Carnival</span> in 1939, later said, “My generation thought of F. Scott Fitzgerald as an age rather than as a writer, and when the economic strike of 1929 began to change the sheiks and flappers into unemployed boys and underpaid girls, we consciously and a little belligerently turned our backs on Fitzgerald.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Moreover, when Schulberg, who had long been an admirer of Fitzgerald’s fiction, first learned they would be collaborating together, he was surprised to hear Fitzgerald was still alive.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> And Schulberg was not alone. When Fitzgerald gained some notoriety for a series of articles he published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> about having a nervous breakdown, editor Arnold Gingrich quipped that any publicity would help a man many people thought was dead.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Even Fitzgerald’s partner, British columnist Sheilah Graham, claimed that she had, at first, associated his name only with the 1920s.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity and Authorship</h1>
<p>
	Fitzgerald’s on-going struggle with his public image reflects the increased importance of promotional activity in the early decades of the twentieth century. Over his twenty-year career as a professional writer, Fitzgerald wrote dozens of autobiographical, or seemingly autobiographical, pieces for popular magazines, gave numerous interviews, scripted several “interviews” of his own, and he participated, particularly during the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> early years of his career, in many well-publicized spectacles that made good copy for the gossip columns. He also worked with his editor and agent on the production and promotion of his texts. A quick glance through any of his business correspondence will offer numerous examples of these efforts.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> He was particularly concerned with production issues, making suggestions to his publishers about everything from layouts and fonts to bindings and the use of blurbs on dust jackets. He worried about the timing and manner of publication, including forms of serialization, the use of book clubs, and the size of his volumes. Finally, he suggested marketing tactics that would maximize the sale of his books.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Stein was also an ardent self-promoter who spent several decades circulating her work in three different countries. She cultivated relationships with famous artists, writers, publishers, and editors. She sent copies of her books to popular reviewers and critics. She even began writing “portraits” of famous and influential acquaintances at least in part to help her work gain wider visibility.
      </p>
<p>
	In 1911, for instance, she wrote her well-known portrait of Mabel Dodge, a wealthy patron of the arts who had visited Stein’s studio the year before. Dodge liked the piece enough to have it published in a private edition, which she circulated among her friends in Europe and New York. Dodge subsequently wrote the first major explication of Stein’s writing in conjunction with the Armory Show, an art exhibit designed to increase the visibility of contemporary French, German, and Spanish artists in the United States. Dodge’s essay, entitled “Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose,” was first run in the March 1913 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Arts and Decoration</span> and then re-run, along with Stein’s portrait, in the June issue of Arthur Stieglitz’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Camera Work</span>. Stein had similar success a few years later with her portrait of art critic Henry McBride, who also had the piece printed in a private edition and helped to secure its publication in <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span>.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Again, such preoccupations with publicity were not uncommon in the early decades of the twentieth century. As Ann Douglas summarizes, “the dangerous business of attention management and exploitation fascinated all the writers of [this] generation, whether as subject matter or life-style or both.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> res as diverse as T. S. Eliot and Marianne Moore, Willa Cather and Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein all wrestled with the new media apparatus and emerging forms of promotion.
      </p>
<p>
	However, the claim that many, if not all, modernist authors deliberately engaged in some market activity is not necessarily as radical in its implications as some contemporary scholars might contend. Such a position does not mean that earlier work done on writers’ disdain for the market, or on the high/low binary that these studies frequently posit, must simply be discarded. It would be difficult to argue, for instance, that an underlying conception of “pure” art, existing outside the reach of a degraded and degrading mass culture, did not have imaginative appeal in the early decades of the twentieth century. Thus, as Michael Nowlin points out, Ann Douglas presses the point a bit too far when she applies Charlie Chaplin’s term “high lowbrow” as a general descriptor for a wide range of artists simultaneously seeking fame and critical acclaim in the 1920s. The situation was never quite as open or liberatory as this phrase suggests.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Many authors, like both Fitzgerald and Stein, participated in promotional activities while, at times, rhetorically distancing themselves from their own efforts. The year after Fitzgerald’s first novel made him a household name, he wrote his editor, “My one hope is to be endorsed by the intellectually elite &amp; thus be forced on to people as Conrad has.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> This statement is a striking bit of posturing for a best-selling author who had begun sending self-promotional blurbs to his publishers as soon as his first book was released.
      </p>
<p>
	Gertrude Stein also regularly downplayed her own promotional efforts, particularly when communicating with aesthetes. She frequently gave acquaintances the impression that she had no concern for publishing or selling her work, as when she wrote Henry McBride, a critic who saw success as a corrupting influence on artists, to deny that she had any intention of writing a popular autobiography. This particular letter to McBride was written just a few years before Stein began <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> and, when she wrote it, Stein had already given literary agent William Aspinwell Bradley the explicit directive to make her rich and famous. At the same time, she was advising young writers such as Paul Bowles about the importance of cultivating large audiences, advice that certainly contradicted her own supposed commitment to non-commercial art.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Perhaps the most commonly cited example of Stein’s highbrow posturing emerged from the notable success of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography</span>. In “And Now,” an article published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span> shortly before Stein left for her lecture tour, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, Stein’s account of the tour published in 1937, she claims to have suffered a bout of writer’s block after becoming a best-selling author. While these statements might, at first glance, support a reading of Stein as a stereotypical anti-market modernist, this interpretation becomes problematic when the larger context is taken into account. Stein is worrying about her popularity in texts written specifically for mass audiences. In light of this fact, it seems quite limiting to read her professed anxiety outside of its constitutive function in the sphere of celebrity discourse. In the process of proving she can be both a commercial and a critical success, Stein reasserts the existence of these two separate fields of value and suggests the conflict between them. In this way, her anxiety can be read not simply as a reflection of her internal struggle but as a rhetorical move that inscribes the category of “high” art in what is supposedly an antithetical form of discourse.
      </p>
<p>
	This reading is supported by Stein’s descriptions of her writer’s block. She does not attempt, in either piece, to show the psychological effects of a breakdown in her writing process, nor does she attempt to detail her own tentative steps towards a resolution to the problem. Instead, she emphasizes the act of <span style="font-style:italic;">reflection</span>, which is to say she depicts herself, in a characteristically even tone, as someone who has overcome her difficulties. This position allows Stein to navigate between what Pierre Bourdieu has called “the field of restricted production,” in which artists produce for a coterie of elite consumers, and “the field of large-scale production,” in which artists produce for a more generalized “public.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> On one hand, Stein is crafting pieces that are intended for a mass audience. On the other, her supposed psychological difficulty with this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> process reflects a commitment to the values of the avant-garde, even as the posited state of resolution implicitly assures her audience that these issues have no bearing on the piece at hand. Put more simply, the trope of writer’s-block-overcome allows Stein to emphasize her status as an elite artist who has strong reservations about the literary marketplace while she is simultaneously writing pieces that will be marketed to a broad reading public.
      </p>
<p>
	This example demonstrates how an examination of celebrity media can do more than expand our historical knowledge of textual production and consumption at the turn of the century. It can also revitalize analyses of a wide range of texts produced during this period. The latter point is particularly important for scholars attempting to push beyond earlier binary approaches to the same material. The previous examples should make it apparent that traditional oppositions between “high” art and the marketplace do not sufficiently account for some of the major strategies of self-representation employed by Anglo-American writers in the early decades of the twentieth century. Authors who aspired to acquire cultural capital often found themselves negotiating between the supposedly degraded aesthetic forms of the mass market and the dictates of an increasingly prominent celebrity culture. Such writers did not want to be associated with the often anonymous hacks creating so-called “production line” pulp novels, nor did they want their output to be controlled by either the whims of the marketplace or publishers’ marketing machines. These conditions necessitated a distinct authorial presence to ensure the integrity of a given work. Yet authors could not simply market themselves and allow their personae to propel sales, as that would ultimately undermine claims about the autonomy, and the supposedly transcendent value, of “true” art.
      </p>
<p>
	Thus, even a basic understanding of the modernist author represented through “style,” as the selective consciousness suffused throughout a work but never directly represented in it, requires a tacit acknowledgement of the importance of public personae in aesthetic theories and practices during the early twentieth century. When put in these terms, it seems plausible to argue that the changing strategies of authorial self-representation at this time were as much a function of developing celebrity media and increasing public fascination with famous personalities as they were of changed epistemologies or the expanding circuits of consumerism. Pressing such discussions further could allow them to intersect with other contemporary critical conversations about representation, the relationship between modernism and postmodernism, the status of authorship, the regulation of aesthetic categories and hierarchies, the relation of print media to visual media, and the space of the “literary” within the larger cultural field. In all of these areas, celebrity could function as a useful interpretive paradigm, both from a historical perspective and as a unifying concept for textual analyses. On more traditional grounds, it provides a basis for rethinking key elements of modernist culture even as it points to new ways in which binary models can be expanded to better reflect the complex position of writers in the early twentieth century.
      </p>
<p>
	The emergence of a whole subset of cultural artifacts devoted to disseminating information about stars, both real and potential, raised many challenges for people working in the literary field. Yet the complex ways in which writers and other intermediary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> res responded to these difficulties, and the ways in which their efforts were received by an increasingly fragmented reading public, suggest many fruitful areas of inquiry that remain underserved by contemporary modernist scholarship. Both Stein and Fitzgerald attempted to cultivate recognizable images and promote their work to a wide audience. At the same time, they aligned themselves in many ways with elite conceptions of art and often denounced the very tactics they employed. These messages were then refracted through the work of various promoters and publishers before being taken up and/or transformed by journalists, critics, and readers, whose responses, in turn, often inspired more authorial posturing.
      </p>
<p>
	By tracing the specific historical contours of this recursive process, scholars can gain a better understanding of both the vocational sphere of authorship at the turn of the century and the texts produced at that time. Such analysis can also provide benefits that extend well beyond the field of modernist studies. A more systematic engagement with celebrity during this period, and the ways in which particular forms of celebrity media developed, will offer valuable insights into the subsequent restructuring of the cultural field in the latter half of the twentieth century. Understanding the shifting values associated with certain types of public personae might even help to explain the seemingly diminished space afforded to popular authors’ personae in recent decades. So, through more sustained analysis of modern celebrity, we can not only come to a better understanding of a world where Stein’s public appearances and Fitzgerald’s drunken antics were prominent news items, but we can also more readily approach a culture in which writers are rarely afforded such attention.

	  I do not mean to suggest that Fitzgerald’s publicity exerted a simple deterministic force on critics.

	    Any discussion of Fitzgerald’s personal feelings about these references would take me far outside the scope of my argument. I will merely say that evidence suggests he was quite ambivalent about his lingering persona. On one hand, he still clearly felt pride in these notices and collected clippings until his death. For relevant selections from Fitzgerald’s scrapbooks, see Matthew J. Bruccoli, Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, and Joan P. Kerr, eds., <span style="font-style:italic;">The Romantic Egoists</span> (Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 1974), 204–205. On the other hand, Fitzgerald was not always pleased by these mentions, in part because they conflicted with his efforts to construct a more “literary” image. In a semi-autobiographical piece published in late 1936, “Afternoon of an Author,” the narrator stops to listen to music and bitterly remarks, “so long since he had danced, perhaps two evenings in five years, yet a review of his last book had mentioned him as being fond of night clubs; the same review had also spoken of him as being indefatigable. Something in the sound of the word in his mind broke him momentarily and feeling tears of weakness behind his eyes he turned away. It was like in the beginning fifteen years ago when they said he had ‘fatal facility,’ and he labored like a slave over every sentence” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 181).

	    The two main published collections of Fitzgerald’s business letters are Matthew J. Bruccoli, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">As Ever, Scott Fitz-: Letters between F. Scott Fitzgerald and His Literary Agent Harold Ober, 1919–1940</span> (Philadelphia, PA: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1972); John Kuehl and Jackson R. Bryer, eds., <span style="font-style:italic;">Dear Scott/Dear Max: The Fitzgerald-Perkins Correspondence</span> (New York: Charles Scribner’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Sons, 1971). Several other collections of Fitzgerald’s correspondence have important letters left out of these collections. For example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Correspondence</span>, contains a much quoted letter to Max Perkins, not included in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dear Scott/Dear Max</span>, where Fitzgerald complains that reporters “twist [my words] to make an idiot out of me.” Matthew J. Bruccoli and Margaret M. Duggan, eds., <span style="font-style:italic;">Correspondence of F. Scott Fitzgerald</span> (New York: Random House, 1980), 92. See also Matthew J. Bruccoli, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">F.

	  During the months just prior to the publication of any of his books, nearly every letter he wrote to his editor contained suggestions about publishing or marketing. His letter on February 5, 1934, shortly before the book publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Is the Night</span>, provides a telling example. First, he reminds Perkins that the indentations and the layout of his name on the cover should correspond with all of his other books. Then he warns against playing up the fact that some of the action in the book occurs in resorts on the Riviera, as the setting would only feed misconceptions of his work as trivial. He also discourages the use of blurbs because “the public is very, very, very weary of being sold bogus goods.” Finally, he suggests mentioning that several scenes were cut when the book was serialized in <span style="font-style:italic;">Scribner’s</span> magazine to entice people who had already read it. Fitzgerald and Perkins, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dear Scott/Dear Max</span>, 191–2.
