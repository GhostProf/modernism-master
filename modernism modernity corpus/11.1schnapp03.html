It is difficult for us to imagine that archaeology is a relatively recent
discipline, whose establishment dates to the middle of the nineteenth
century. Its development has been so rapid and the interest elicited
by its discoveries so strong that it seems to be a science as ancient
as it is canonical. We should not be misled, however: if the taste for
the past, the passion for collection, the observation of the earth,
are practices as ancient as the earliest humans, archaeology in the
modern sense of the term was only constituted as an autonomous and
recognized discipline at the moment it was able to emancipate itself
from bric-a-brac, from the impossibility of dating objects and monuments
with certainty, from the barrier that separated the history of man from
the history of nature. The moment of that rupture, which transformed the
old antiquarian quest into actual archaeology, coincides with the middle
of the nineteenth century and the advent of the positive sciences. It
consists in an upheaval of the first order affecting the humanist domain
as well as the natural sciences, anthropology as well as geology or
paleontology. It is interesting to examine the conditions under which
research in Antiquity, traditionally dependent on philology, was able to
elaborate its own model of development by freeing itself from the primacy
of text over monument, from the cult of the work of art in favor of the
history of material culture, from the centrality of universal history
in favor of the diversity of regional and local histories.
<p>
This work, begun in Germany with Johann Winckelmann, in France with
the Comte de Caylus, in England with the "Society of Dilettanti," took
shape in a private international society founded in Rome in 1829. The
"Instituto di Corrispondenza


<b></b>


Archeologica," created by Christian von Bunsen, the Prussian ambassador
to Rome, and supported by a host of scholars and aristocrats including
the crown prince of Prussia (the future Friedrich Wilhelm IV), Count
Metternich, the Duc de Blacas, and a young German scholar, Eduard Gerhard,
is the ancestor of all our modern archaeological institutions. It embodies
a universal model of knowledge that owes its style to Alexander von
Humboldt and its tradition to Gerhard.
<p>
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, passion for Antiquity was
expressed by collection, imitation of ancient works of art, and study of
literary sources: the collector, the artist, and the philologist were
the three symbolic res of antiquarian curiosity. Gerhard, born in
1795, knew this milieu well, having frequented it first while studying
in Breslau and Berlin, and then especially during his numerous stays in
Italy. A student of Friedrich August Wolf and August Boeck, he displayed
impeccable philological erudition (in April 1815 he was the first doctor
"<i>rite promotus</i>" of the brand new University of Berlin). Above all
this admirer of Goethe and close friend of Alois Hirt and Ernst Toelken
at the Prussian Academy of Fine Arts exhibited an obvious sensitivity
for art. In this city which openly claimed its royal destiny, the fine
arts were one of the elements of urban and political development. The
Hohenzollern family was moreover heavily involved in the development
of museums and the support of the study of Antiquity. The patronage of
the crown prince and the close friendships that Gerhard had formed with
the milieu of Roman connoisseurs naturally played a decisive role in
this context.
<p>
Gerhard was at once a dedicated scholar, a museum curator, and a
university professor. His professional career lived out the different
stages of the institutionalization of the discipline: he was first a
secondary school instructor, then a simple Prussian grant holder in
Rome, before becoming the secretary of the Institute he had founded,
returning to Germany in 1833 as "archaeologist" of the Berlin museum,
and finally being named professor at the prestigious university in
1844. But his uninterrupted activity did not exhaust the man's ardor:
a member of the Berlin Academy, he promoted great learned enterprises
like the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i> and the inventory of
Etruscan mirrors. The founder of several scholarly journals, he directed
for years the <i>Arch&#x000E4;ologische Zeitung</i> he had created. He
was no stranger either&#x02014;which seems surprising today&#x02014;to the
ancient art trade, from which he was able to make a profit. However, if
we add that he donated all his collections of books and antiquities to
the University of Berlin and that he willed a large sum to the Academy
for the creation of a research grant, we see that the man in his diverse
facets incarnated a type of scholar very different from the aristocrats
or the abb&#x000E9;s of the eighteenth century.
<p>
Published in 1850, thus three years after the first volume of Boucher de
Perthes's <i>Antiquit&#x000E9;s celtiques et ant&#x000E9;diluviennes</i>
and nine years before Darwin's <i>Origin of the Species,</i> the
<i>Archaeological Theses</i> can be considered the emancipation program
for classical archaeology and the establishment of its new course. At this
time Gerhard was fortified by the experience acquired in the creation
of the Instituto, whose three types of publications, <i>Bolletino,
Annali,</i> and <i>Monumenti,</i> were intended to provide the scholarly
public with a complete panoply of editorial tools. The <i>Bolletino</i>
was dedicated


<b></b>


to current information, to following the news; the <i>Annali</i> were
to receive scholarly communications from the corresponding members;
and the <i>Monumenti</i> (which took up an old idea of Winckelmann's)
were designed to offer detailed publication of the monuments and great
series of objects of Antiquity. Around these three tools, an international
community of scholars and patrons worked to provide the Istituto with
an effective editorial and documentary structure.
<p>
It was a project at once universalist (even if limited to the
Mediterranean world) and functionalist: only systematic publication
of antiquities would allow for their understanding and their
protection. Gerhard and his colleagues&#x02014;of course, he was not
alone&#x02014;saw in the Istituto an instrument for the dissemination
of knowledge with the goal of saving the archaeological patrimony
of Antiquity in the way Renaissance scholars had made accessible, and
oftentimes rediscovered, textual sources. When Gerhard invented the term
<i>monumental philology</i> to characterize his project in opposition
to traditional philology, he positioned himself as the inventor of a new
approach to antiquity, just as Alde Manuce and Guillaume Bud&#x000E9; had
revolutionized the history of the classical tradition. Emancipated from
a weighty indenture, archaeology participates by other means in the same
goal as philology. Faced with the activity of artists and collectors,
archaeologists seek to acquire a concrete knowledge of objects and
monuments. Antiquity should not remain a model to imitate, but should
become a source of innovation. The archaeologist's task will be to
observe the great ancient corpus with positive methods of description
and analysis.
<p>
Gerhard's <i>Archaeological Theses</i> are the product of a positivist
overturning of the curiosity for the past, seeking not only to
establish rules of description, but to give archaeologists indices,
tools, techniques, in short the entire arsenal of an independent
discipline. To that end, archaeology must have the right means. At
the University of Berlin Gerhard created, against the advice of the
philologists, a <i>Lehrapparat:</i> a collection of books, iconographic
volumes, ancient objects, and casts designed for pedagogy. It is at the
University that future archaeologists would henceforth learn the rules
of their profession, before objects that they would be allowed to touch,
to see, and to see again.
<p>
Gerhard insisted on this material and technical side of archaeological
education: <i>"Monumentorum artis quis unum vidit, nullum vidit, quis
millia vidit, unum vidit."</i> (He who sees one art monument sees none;
he who sees thousands, sees one.) He was not the founding father of
a new discipline, for others before him, and after him, brought their
contribution to the establishment of archaeology, but at a century's
distance from his illustrious predecessor the Comte de Caylus, he was
able to express in a concise and effective formulation the intangible
rules of the profession.
