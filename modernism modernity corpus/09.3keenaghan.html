<p>
In 1913, young Wallace Stevens confessed to his wife Elsie, "[M]y habits are positively lady-like." This epistolary admission launches Frank Lentricchia's <i>Ariel and the Police,</i> a study of continuing importance to gender readings of the poet.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Lentricchia cites the remark to indicate Stevens's discomfort with Gilded Age precepts, inculcated by his father's admonitions, about masculinity and the "effeminacy" of writing verse. By rooting the poet's career in a classic family drama framed by a period's gender ideologies, the critic re-masculinizes his subject and ascribes him to the role of anti-patriarchal poet, "the potential subverter of his official role as a young American male."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Yet because Lentricchia relegates Stevens's gender struggle to its documentation in private letters and expression in confessional lyric, the poet's "subversion" is limited to a fixed set of psychological strategies that restructure his <i>individual</i> relationship to gender identities as they are formed in familial oedipal dramas.

<p>
<i>Ariel and the Police</i> secures Stevens's place as an archetypal modernist, a solitary poet who re-creates history and society in his own image and on the page, even if his yawp is lacking some of the requisite barbarism. Any depiction of his gender trouble as private psychologism, however, risks minimizing the public function that Stevens himself ascribes to poetry. Although nested away in private notebooks, the <i>Adagia</i> (1934-c.1940) constitute his earliest attempts to formulate an explicit statement of this function, later finding their way into many of his public speeches and programmatic poems. In his notebooks, Stevens distances 
<b></b>
his work from lyric's supposed confessionalism when he states that "Poetry is not personal." (This insight is later repeated with a slight variation, "Poetry is not a personal matter").
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Its publicity stems from its propositional qualities, its embodiment of "the statement of a relation between a man and the world" (<i>OP,</i> 197). Another adage adds, "The real is only the base. But it is the base" of the poem's relational statement (<i>OP,</i> 187). Through an important simile, Stevens compares the relation between the poet and the actual world to heterosexual eroticism: "A poet looks at the world somewhat as a man looks at a woman" (<i>OP,</i> 192). A gender reading of Stevens can begin by combining these choice <i>Adagia</i> into one proposition: Poetry is a public discourse derived from the poet's imaginative reconstruction of and erotic engagement with a "real," or social, "base." Because they are imaginative, poems never exist apart from elements of privacy and psychology; yet Stevens intuits that poetry's social effectiveness depends upon its ability to create correlations between private interests and the desires of large communities.

<p>
Stevens's minor qualification that poets only engage the world in a "somewhat" erotic manner lays bare how poetry's progressive public function is capable of reproducing some social asymmetries. Although he argues throughout his career that the imagination introduces change, Stevens's simile precludes any reimagining of gender binaries or epistemological structures that privilege masculine subjects as the entitled beneficiaries of a heteroerotic gaze. Consequently, I would advise a cautious approach to reading Stevens's redefinition of gender. Rather than reading him as an anti-patriarchal or subversive poet, it would be more accurate to characterize his work as arguing only for a <i>selective</i> revision of gender roles. That selection hinges on an identification of private desire&#8212;his private oedipal struggles against the Father and his resultant anxieties about the "effeminacy" of writing&#8212;with a larger community's interests. And time and again, Stevens defines that community along racial lines; in the early part of his career, his virile poet speaks only to white North America, to which he appeals to revise its precepts of masculine identity.

<p>
He does not mention race and gender together in any one essay, but the literary and social significances he separately ascribes to each suggest that they may be interrelated in his poetry. For example, in response to the 1938 questionnaire from <i>Twentieth Century Verse,</i> Stevens claims that "[t]he relationship between Americans is at least approximately racial, and does not pretend to be anything else . . . In short, there exists a clear sense of what is American" (<i>OP,</i> 308). Five years later in his essay "The re of the Youth as Virile Poet" , he would conclude that poetry's historical force was determined by its masculine qualities. "The centuries have a way of being male. Without pretending to say whether they get this character from their good heroes or their bad ones, it is certain that they get it, in part, from their philosophers and poets."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Stevens's ideal virile poet is conscious of "his obligation" to "the larger society"; he "must be the master of our lives" and is responsible for re-visioning society ("FY," 66). Race and gender are complementary terms that mediate poetry's imaginative negotiations of social narratives. Stevens's own desire and individual worldview could be thought to link the two as analogous functions, but even that mediating desire
<b></b>
is as discursively structured as his poetry's topical "base" of social referents.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 In the "Virile Poet" essay and in the <i>Adagia</i>, Stevens never contends that poetry challenges existent ideologies (as in Lentricchia's reading); instead, a "virile" poetic ensures that "invisible" and perhaps unconscious currents of thought become "visible," concrete, and stabilized social realities.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Given his and the period's cultural logics, his proof of white poetic masculinity's potency depends on poetry's ability to manage racial differences so as to intercede in debates about national identity.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>


<p>
A heightened consciousness of African American presences pervades Stevens's writings, and he often misconstrues racial subjects as unsettling the desired fixity of the poet's stance in relation to the world. When he introduces race, the poet's position is no longer just "somewhat" erotic; his narrators' perspectives become <i>overdetermined</i> by what his contemporaries would interpret as perverse forms of sexual desire, ranging from miscegenation to voyeurism to homosexuality. I do not read this perversion as a simplistic return of the racialized repressed, or as evidence that Stevens unsuccessfully suppresses African American culture or his desire to possess it, in either an appropriative or a sexual sense. In fact, he usually openly and directly addresses race. If it is inaccurate to read the erotic disruption that coincides with racial res as a symptom of a conflation of sexual and racial anxieties, it is best to read it as an indicator of social hierarchies, a glitch in Stevens's poetic that reveals his ideal of progressive poetic potency and actually necessitates a preservation of some social asymmetries. Discomforted, Stevens's narrators attempt to turn readers' attention away from African American res in order to dampen the visibility of their desire, not for racialized sexual objects, but for a controlling virility that reproduces some of the masculine qualities that Stevens hopes to change. Eroticism is the "tell" that reveals that the poet is <i>managing</i> social factors, even though he cannot let on that he is doing so for fear of making art collusive with a Fordist business ethos and of revealing that the supposedly democratic poet cannot simultaneously be egalitarian and virile.

<p>
An early depiction of the management of race occurs in "The Silver Plough-Boy"  (<i>OP,</i> 17). Only the title makes it clear that the poem presents a tableau of labor. The first line inscribes the eponymous worker in a racialized picaresque episode; he is a "black re" who "dances in a black field." As a "re" (rather than the titular "boy"), the worker is reified, an effect pronominally concretized in the lines that follow: "<i>It</i> seizes a sheet," "<i>It</i> wraps the sheet around <i>its</i> body," and "<i>It</i> dances down a furrow" (emphasis added). Rachel Blau DuPlessis reads the plough-boy as an "impish" muse who enables Stevens to recast "certain political tragedies [i.e., lynching and the KKK] policing African American life into blurry mythoi outside of time or space" because the sheet erases the black male body.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 I would venture one step further and suggest that the pronoun "it" neuters the plough-boy and preemptively defuses any eroticism. If the sheet should fall, his black body would no longer blend into the background of the "black field" since the impending arrival of the dawn's "early light" will illuminate him. By beginning three consecutive lines with the word "it," Stevens's narrator trains his reader to see this laborer as a dehumanized and de-eroticized object artfully rendered.



<b></b>

<p>

Yet, ambivalences surface. Although the sheet prophylactically hides the laborer's body, it also paradoxically imports an erotic valence. Only its silver color distinguishes the body from the pre-matinal background. In a sense, the covering makes the reader more aware of the laboring body, even if that body's maleness and race are erased by the impromptu costume's formlessness. The very banality of the object also generates sexual associations. The location from where the plough-boy "seizes" this ordinary sheet, "spread" outside by "some washer-woman," is of no small significance. "It seizes a sheet, from the ground, from the bush[.]" The second prepositional phrase ever so slightly adjusts and raises the first index, so that the sheet is taken from some location not on ground level. The word "bush" connotes an inviting female sexuality, especially when combined with the verb "spread." These associations multiply rather than contain the poem's perverse possibilities. Is this black boy in a sort of drag, wrapped in bedsheets once spread over a female anatomy? Or is the sheet a fetish? What is the race of the person to whom these sheets belong? There is a class difference between the black plough-boy and the sheet's presumed owner, since it is spread by another worker, "some washer-woman"; these differences might invite the reader to imagine an interracial sexual encounter. And should the sheet fall before a male reader's gaze (or the male poet's or a male narrator's), then he, conditioned by the poem's erotic elements, will see the boy's revealed body as a homoerotic object. A banal sheet expands multiform "perversions"&#8212;homoeroticism, transvestism, fetishism, miscegenation&#8212;that the narrator can neither anticipate nor eliminate.

<p>
The image of the plough-boy's linen-wound body eerily echoes W. E. B. DuBois's description of the color line as a Veil of double consciousness in <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> . Contrary to DuBois's expectations, though, Stevens's poem indicates that it is possible for the Veil hiding the black subject to fall away in the white imagination. The narrator's prophylactic descriptions indicate a desire to restore the Veil, to direct the reader's attention away from the plough-boy's revealed body in order to make it clear the narrator evinces a manly control. When the sheet does fall, the narrator fixes the reader's attention on the Veil. "How softly the sheet falls to the ground!" Although the boy loses all agency ("the sheet falls") and his body disappears, there are still lingering erotic traces in the line's uncharacteristically Whitmanesque length, replete with a repetition of three separate and breathy exclamations. Voice the run-on line aloud, and hear the narrator's aspirated panting: "How soon," "How soon," "How softly."

<p>
When presented alone, African American res risk unfixing the virility by which Stevens measures a poet's historical force. A narrator who is reduced to panting does not provide an exemplary virile management of the racial subject for white consumption. In order to find some subject who can better model the possibilities for redefining gender by better controlling race issues, Stevens often turns outside the racialized turbulence of immediate domestic scenes to res of Hispanic&#8212;most specifically, Cuban&#8212;masculinity. When present in Stevensian texts that evoke blackness, Cuban res do the cultural work of binding the erotic excesses of racial difference.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Hispanic males function as North Americans' off-white brothers who can be invited into the national community and so prove that the boundaries defining "white masculinity" are somewhat malleable, even if texts exhibit adverse reactions to African American presences.



<b></b>

<p>

The earliest instance of Stevens's juxtaposition of African American and Hispanic tropes to negotiate masculinity occurs in a 1912 letter to Elsie, which tells of a circuitous walk from the Bronx's Van Cortlandt Park to Greenwich, Connecticut, and back to Manhattan (<i>LWS,</i> 177). The complexities of this private letter find resonances with his public poetry, so it is worthwhile to give this document some extended consideration. Stevens describes his marathon-length walk as a miniaturized gothic odyssey. "Walking through the dark, to a strange place, with that mystical lantern in the trees, I could hear the early bells, calling for vesper-services." The scene becomes more unsettling with the unexpected appearance of "two creeking stages full of negroes, returning from a pic-nic, with their arms etc. all intertwined." The strangers' unexpected arrival elicits an exaggerated sense of Stevens's seduction by, and even metamorphosis because of, their presence. "I flitted along-side unseen, for a long time, like a moth . . . I had my shirt turned back and my chemisette flung back, precisely like that corsair of hearts, le grand Byron, and I breathed!" By describing his metamorphosis through the image of a moth rather than the more conventional butterfly, Stevens emphasizes the significance of the <i>lure</i>, the raced subjects' erotic yet deadly flame. Drawn toward them, his body is set free (he "breathed!"), but such freedom can be fatal. The effeminate and accessorizing laciness of his imagined Byronic costume's loosened "chemisette" draws a close association between Stevens and the moth's textured wing; both are doomed because of their loss of will and their attractions to irresistable lures.

<p>
Prolonged erotic stimulation interrupts his epic walk and disrupts gender conventions, but Stevens confesses the need to hide his "exhilaration" upon returning to "town, and its sorrows, and civilities" so as to blend in "as neatly as anyone" and not alienate himself. He "put[s] a noose around [his] neck," a metaphor that evokes a more conventionally masculine accessory, a tie. Although it gestures toward an image of an urbane and comported businessman, this "noose" still recalls rather than eliminates race, enacting a symbolic self-lynching that exorcises the libidinal effects of his encounter with cultural difference. In order to become a better Manhattanite, Stevens assumes another masculine role. "In New York, I bought a piece of meat (wow-ow-oo-oo-ruh-r-r-r!) and a Belinda perfecto and limped down the Avenue, looking like a Spanish gentleman, and blowing great rings of smoke, lighted home&#8212;still by that heavenly flame." A return to an acceptable, "civilized" masculinity is made possible with the guise of "a Spanish gentleman." The letter's absurdity and eeriness is amplified by his confession that he "bought a piece of meat" and a Cuban cigar, phallic accessories that complete his masculine costume. His comic yet disturbing growl reveals that the erotic effects have not subsided even long after he returns home and composes the letter. The chemisette marks the erotic allure of the "stages full of negroes," a sign of the encounter's feminizing eroticism and of how the racialized presence obviates all recognizable gender limits. The Spanish costume's phallic props are more recognizably masculine, but Stevens's performance fails to pass because a symptomatic growl signifies a persistent and uncontainable eroticism, something about gender that still lies beyond his performative control.

<p>
Over the course of his career, he refines the 1912 mask of the "Spanish gentleman" and shifts his Hispanic res from Iberian to more identifiably Latin American representations.
<b></b>
Latin American and Caribbean res recur in Stevens's poetic oeuvre, and their functions shift from poem to poem and from period to period during his career.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 In <i>Harmonium</i> (1923, revised 1931) and <i>Ideas of Order</i> , he specifically deploys that Hispanic culture with which he was most "familiar"&#8212;the Cuban&#8212;to shore up a sense of poetic virility.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 This southward turn, though, introduces new complications that exacerbate rather than mitigate the social asymmetries underlying his gender project. As Louis Zukofsky once remarked, even the most imaginative of Stevens's poems "somehow suffered the history of the Americas."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 By and large, Stevens is open to the possibility that Cuban cultural differences need not be interpreted as power hierarchies. The "base" for his imagining, however, is founded upon North American ideologies and practices of imperialism. Despite his best intentions, his work is limited by the material realities of economic and cultural imperialism; his narrators often exhibit a need to manage <i>lo cubano</i> (Cubanness) in order to ensure that it does not produce unbecoming destabilizations of white masculinity resembling those effected by black res. Eroticisms and perversions still surface as symptoms of the impotence of Stevens's virile poet and of his inability to allay very real social asymmetries.

Cuba, the Platt Amendment, and the Historical Basis for National Poetic Virility

<p>
Stevens's frequent recreational and working vacations to Key West did establish an early attraction to nearby Cuba, an interest augmented by his two visits to the island nation in 1923 and then renewed by his correspondence with essayist, translator, and editor Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez Feo in 1944. His private fascination, however, provides insufficient explanation for why Cuba is culturally important to his pursuit of the virile American poet. In fact, we can get a better sense of Stevens's "private" fascination if we situate it in a "public" socio-historical context that structures his desire. Cuba itself was an object of the United States' imperial desire long before <i>Harmonium</i>'s publication. Throughout the nineteenth century, the U.S. was not at ease with Spain's strong colonial presence on the Caribbean island since Cuba's close proximity posed a security threat and the colonial government prohibited the expansion of North American foreign markets. Since the start of the Ten Years' War in 1868, Congress openly debated whether it was in the best interest of the U.S. to annex Cuba or to help it win its sovereignty. The debate would not be resolved until the Spanish-American War of 1898, in which President William McKinley spearheaded the anticolonial war effort to quell nationalist activity that threatened to prevent the U.S. from ever developing market interests in Cuba.

<p>
After the war's conclusion, the United States sought to protect its political and economic investments in the Cuban Republic by appending the Platt Amendment to the new nation's 1901 constitution. Historian Louis A. P&eacute;rez, Jr., notes that the Platt Amendment embodied an "adequate if imperfect substitute for annexation" because "it served to transform the substance of Cuban sovereignty into an extension of the U.S. national system."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Politically, the legislation rendered the island vulnerable to military intervention 
<b></b>
and intercessions in the development of foreign policy. Economically, it promoted an early form of neoliberal expansion and lay the groundwork for the Reciprocity Treaty of 1903, which "accelerated the integration of the Cuban economy into the North American system" by eliminating tariffs and flooding the Cuban market with U.S. capital and goods (<i>C,</i> 122). Land speculation increased, followed by what P&eacute;rez calls "the onset of large-scale colonization schemes" that resulted in the establishment of "agricultural colonies"(<i>C,</i> 123, 124). North Americans' economic and cultural presence produced what the historian elsewhere refers to as "ambivalence and antagonism" concerning "the means by which Cubans experienced cultural authenticity." He elaborates, "So thoroughly had North American forms penetrated the structural order of daily life that it was often almost impossible to make a sharp distinction between what was properly 'Cuban' and what was 'North American.'"
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>


<p>
Although P&eacute;rez focuses almost exclusively on how the North American presence affected Cuban national culture and identity, his documentation of nineteenth-century annexation debates and early-twentieth-century expansionist activity provides a correlative sense of how the Caribbean nation impacted the North American cultural imaginary. In both countries, contentions over the Platt Amendment gave rise to accusations of U.S. imperialism, resulting in the growth of a confused public discourse about the nature of imperialism. In order to get a brief impression of this open discourse during Stevens's early period, we need only turn to a 1928 publication by political scientist Leland Hamilton Jenks.

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
It is my firm belief that these facts [about the nature of Cuba's relationship to the U.S.] are not well understood in the United States . . . I have myself encountered an American Master of Arts who thought Cuba was a territory, an infantry sergeant who thought the island was in 1926 occupied by American troops, a Washington official who thought that Havana was a seaport of the United States. The relations between Cuba and the United States have been such, or have been so construed, that it is a widespread popular belief that Cuba is part of an incipient American Empire.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
When trying to clear up the public's confusion, Jenks refuses to characterize Cuban-U.S. relations as imperialist largely because he feels that "Cuba's story is only incidentally a matter of politics. It is fundamentally a matter of economics."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 It is fallacious, however, to distinguish between political and economic modes of imperialism, and U.S. policies at the turn of the century evince a desire to protect <i>both</i> its political and economic vested interests. Each of Jenks's supposedly misguided interviewees actually grasps different aspects of the North American presence in Cuba, a presence that the Platt Amendment rendered what might be called <i>ambivalently imperialist</i> until its 1934 repeal by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. During the first three decades of Cuba's independence, the United States repeatedly reinterpreted this "organic document," as P&eacute;rez calls it, in order to justify military interventions that aided successive Cuban regimes' defense against nationalist, anti-imperialist insurgences that would threaten North American market and political influences; yet the rhetoric of the document and of political pundits supported the spirit of anticolonialism and Cuban independence.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>




<b></b>


<p>
For the duration of the Platt Amendment, public discourses revised U.S. borders, which oscillated between inclusion and exclusion of Cuba. The document's general intent was to establish a Cuban protectorate, and two of its articles especially contributed to the indeterminacy of what we now, in this age of NAFTA, presume to be firmly established (and heavily defended) national boundaries. The anticipated migration of residents and consumer goods between Florida and Cuba rendered boundaries so permeable that the legislators who drafted the amendment saw fit to mandate the improvement of Cuban cities' sanitation systems in Article V, "thereby assuring protection to the people and commerce of Cuba, as well as to the commerce of the southern ports of the United States and of the people residing therein." Article VI designates the Isle of Pines, located off the Cuban mainland's southwest shore, as a nationless limbo. The isle "shall be omitted from the proposed constitutional boundaries of Cuba, the title thereto being left to further adjustment by treaty." This article left the determination of the Caribbean republic's boundaries contingent on the unpredictable needs of its North American "protector." It was only after the Isle of Pines' harbors were discovered to be too shallow for a naval base that Congress ratified the Hay-Quesada Treaty in 1925 and remanded proprietorship to Cuba.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>


<p>
The Platt Amendment's legislation of mutable borders continued to have felt effects on both nations long after its repeal. Novelist and cultural philosopher Waldo Frank remarks that F. D. R.'s repeal was only a symbolic though "well-intentioned" gesture because "the dependence of Cuba on the United States was by then a structural fact which only a blow against the structure itself could shatter."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 That blow would not come until the Cuban Revolution of 1959, four years after Stevens's death. The clear infrastructural, political, and cultural boundaries existing between the two nations today are products of that fateful break. Cultural differences now are so sharply defined that they make it difficult to recall or even to imagine the extent to which these two countries' geopolitical boundaries were once subject to flux. For the entirety of his life, however, Stevens knew Cuba only as a space that simultaneously existed <i>both</i> as a part of and apart from a North American cultural identity.

<p>
As Jenks's study exemplifies, there was enough indeterminate discussion about the ambivalent status of Cuba's relationship to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s for writers and other cultural producers to trope the island in order to address seemingly unconnected domestic issues. To do so, writers needed to resolve for themselves what Cuba "was." For Stevens, the island nation was both inside and outside his imagined North American community. In order to contain any possibly disruptive eroticism, Stevens imagines Cuba as an exotic space of ontological difference outside U.S. borders; set apart, his narrators effectively manage the difference originating in this space. In order for Cuba to retain any utility for his domestic project, though, it is more common for Stevens to play with the idea that Florida might serve as a metonym evoking the long-debated possibility of Cuba's annexation. Because the Platt Amendment rendered national boundaries fluid and permeable, the archipelago of the Florida Keys is easily imagined as forming a "borderlands" that blurs national limits and extends North American cultural spaces into Cuban territories. A foreignness, then, can 
<b></b>
be found on domestic soil. Stevens plays with the ambivalences opened in definitions of national integrity, determining when and how it would be "safe" for him to evoke Cuban cultural difference when constructing the re of a more virile (North) American (white) poet, with a minimum of reference to political asymmetries.

<p>
Before I discuss Stevens's Floridean borderlands, I will close this section with one example of his poetic containment and distancing of Cuban culture. In his poem "The Revolutionists Stop for Orangeade" (c.1930), Stevens dehistoricizes Cuba, erasing evidence of the material conditions of neoliberal expansion and Cuban nationalists' insurrection, in order to render the island nation a more plastic poetic resource.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Ironically, this puts him at odds with his own imperative that poetry register social reality (albeit a reality filtered through the imagination). His struggle to trope <i>lo cubano</i> produces an ambivalent synthesis that can recognize the social realities of imperialism only by comically refashioning them so that this foreign space might become a "harmless" site in which he stages his poetic imaginary.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Because his poem has been included in the <i>Collected Poems</i>' version of <i>Harmonium,</i> the chronology of its composition may be misleading. Joan Richardson includes "Revolutionists" among those poems written around 1930 for inclusion in the second Knopf edition of <i>Harmonium</i> , seven years after the first edition's 1923 publication.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 The poem's chronology is significant in that it underscores how Stevens imaginatively revises events of his social "base" to demonstrate his poetic virility.

<p>
Who are the original historical "revolutionists" to whom the title refers? Determining their identity necessitates reading the poem through the narrator's polyglot speech. Spanish words enter his lexicon&#8212;"capit&aacute;n," "profundo," "pomposo"&#8212;all of which are homophonic calques of English words (captain, profound, pompous). Anomalous words&#8212; "bellissimo" and "geloso"&#8212;that are not from the foreign idiom also appear. The Spanish equivalent for the superlative "most beautiful" would be "bell&iacute;smo," not "bellissimo." Stevens seems to confuse an Italian cognate with a Spanish one; after all, he was very frank about not having much knowledge of Spanish.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 "Geloso" is also an Italian term (the Spanish is "celoso"). If one were to pronounce "geloso" not as a native speaker (x&eacute;!lo!so) but as an English speaker (g&eacute;l!ous!o), then it would "sound" like a homophonic "translation" of "jealous." Stevens's neologistic homophone indicates a forcible introduction of Spanish (or Spanglish) despite his lack of familiarity with the language, the adoption of which indicates that the revolutionaries are either from the populist Mexican Revolution (1910-17) or one of Cuba's many nationalist resurrections. The latter is more likely given the time of the poem's composition. After his 1925 election, the administration of Cuban president Gerardo Machado faced much opposition because he amended the constitution to extend his presidential term, conducted antilabor movement campaigns, imprisoned political opponents, and ignored high unemployment produced by the global depression of 1929 and the subsequent inflation of U.S. tariffs on Cuban exports. Insurgences included an aborted revolution in 1931&#8212;the year when Stevens's poem appeared in the revised version of <i>Harmonium</i>. The Cuban political crisis would have been very much on the minds of Stevens and his readers.



<b></b>

<p>
Encrypted in the poem's title lies a reactionary headline&#8212;"Revolutions Stop Foreign Aid." The pun of the title registers how interventionist policies often were presented as "foreign aid" intended to help a newly liberated nation maintain its supposed sovereignty. The ludicrous situation of revolutionists stopping for orangeade introduces the reader to a site of leisure in which Stevens's narrator functions as a mask through which the poet can play with a foreign tongue. But there is a gravity, what the narrator calls "pith," in such linguistic play. His parodic interpretation of the Spanish idiom is a substitute for the revolutionary role that defines the narrator and his peers. By questioning the captain's demand that the soldiers "sing standing in the sun," the narrator postpones and intervenes in the battle. As an alternative activity, he suggests a "song of serpent-kin" sung in a costume of "clownish boots," "breeches," a "Coat half-flare and half galloon," and a "helmet." The coat is to be only "half galloon" (half trimmed by lace or metallic embroidery) and "half-flare[d]." Its incompleteness suggests an impoverished version of an outmoded, seventeenth-century Spanish colonial fashion. The helmet is to be worn "without reason, / Tufted, tilted, twirled, and twisted," a dandyesque accessory, complete with the extravagant nonchalance of "a feather by your eye." By introducing a vaudevillian lapse into a leisurely yet "pithy" play with recognizable signs of Spanish conquistador culture, the narrator interrupts the revolution that historically could have unseated Machado. When a revolution would succeed in 1933, the Cuban Republic's sovereignty would be disabled, resulting in a North American intervention that would usher in the proliferation of goods and influences in political and economic markets. The anachronistic choice of costume itself is significant since it suggests the narrator's neocolonial identification yet interrupts an anticolonial and anti-imperial epic political moment "in the sun" and even prevents the eventual development of a North American neocolonialism.

<p>
We cannot read "Revolutionists" as either an endorsement or protest of any international politics. Stevens maintains an ambivalent political stance because his primary objective in this poem is to produce an imaginary space that revisions embodied masculinity in a domestic space. It is strange that the narrator of "Revolutionists" first suggests "the breeches of a mask" for the parodic costume. Covering, costuming, and masking the body's nether-regions forcibly circumscribes the male subject's eroticism. Whereas the body would be put on well-lit display in all its corporeality ("Hairy-backed and hump-armed, / Flat-ribbed and big-bagged") if the captain's command were to be carried out, the narrator imagines hiding a borderline grotesque male physique under a costume's shabby finery and outdated extravagance. It may be dandyesque, but the performance also includes "singing in a voice / Rougher than a grinding shale," a hypermasculine vocality that counteracts any effeminate associations with a failed colonial enterprise. Vaudeville itself is a <i>North American</i> cultural form popularized abroad during this time in such Havana cabarets as the Tropicana, which catered to North American and European tourists. The revolutionist's suggested vaudeville refashions colonialism and imperialism so that it loses political significance and better suits the aesthetic interests of a North American masculine subject whose sense of gender identity could be compromised if the anatomical "base" of virility&#8212;the male body itself&#8212;is laid bare for all to see.



<b></b>

<p>

Most probably, the nullification of the historical potential of Cuban insurgence is an imperialist effect, not an intent, of Stevens's poem. His primary interest lies in shoring up North American poetic masculinity. The unruliness of the revolutionist's body has less to do with international politics than it does with gender constructs. The narrator's conquistador mask functions in a similar way to the sheet of "The Silver Plough-Boy": both try to erase the observed male re's physicality, yet end up calling attention to it. In "Revolutionists," the narrator's reference to "serpent-kin" evokes an Edenic stage, a mythological space antedating historical and political time. The narrator is not only Adamic because he tries to control his surroundings through a poetic naming but also because he is subject to temptation and the awakening of desire. The song he desires to hear will be delivered by vocalists who wrap their "Tongues around the fruit," an alimentary and sexually suggestive image that continues the Edenic conceit and reminds us that the song's sheer staginess would put his and other males' bodies front-and-center. The narrator keeps emphasizing the details of the gaudy costume in an attempt to shift attention away from the performing bodies and toward the exotic and paradisal production of a Cuban romance.

<p>
Evidently, Stevens is struggling to move beyond things as they are. In order to make this performance of <i>lo cubano</i> a successful tool for revising North American masculinity, the revolutionist's charming and harmless comic relief must minimize any real political threat to the prevailing social order, whether that order be under the auspices of Machado or an intervening North American protectorate. Instead of political threats and crises, "Revolutionists" performs cultural difference in a romanticized way that allows the reader to imagine new possibilities for masculinity. But the poem's surface play with language and its performative gender roles are themselves enabled by an ambivalent dependence on an imperialist "base." In some ways, the poem's ideological composition is not unlike a legislative structure like the Platt Amendment, which disavows imperialist asymmetries even while enacting them. To insist on the "breeches of a mask," to disguise a cultural rift (breach) under fantastic costuming (breeches), Stevens puts himself at odds with his own imperative that we measure the poet's virility by the historical force of his work. His revolutionist's strategy of aestheticizing the battle at hand is escapist, rather than epic, and it produces an unsatisfactory and counterintuitive Edenic mythos. The dramatic assemblage of the poem suggests that Stevens needs to lay bare the mechanics and material conditions of history, but the suggested performance is caught between an incompleteness that would produce a Brechtian alienation effect and an unwitting revelation of the poet's own motivating anxieties. In later poems, Stevens reduces his mythologizing tendencies by producing Cuban interlocutors transplanted from the Caribbean's political turbulence into the securely domestic yet topographically "foreign" space of the Floridean borderlands. In that topography, his white and Hispanic interlocutors form a community that embodies a spectrum of whiteness and renders new "American" masculinities imaginable.

Stevens's Florida Poems and the Borderlands of American Modernism 
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Rethinking the relationship between American modernisms and imperialism demands a reconsideration of the "borderlands" and other key critical concepts from border theory and postcolonial studies. In her theory of subaltern resistance in the Southwest, Gloria Anzald&uacute;a defines a borderland as "a vague and undetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural boundary. It is in a constant state of transition. The prohibited and forbidden are its inhabitants."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 The indeterminism of this space is embodied by the mestiza, an interracial female re whose "plural personality" allows her to adapt to her changing environment "by developing a tolerance for contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity," and by "learn[ing] to juggle cultures."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Whereas feminist, queer, and Chicano/a studies have found Anzald&uacute;a's borderlands theory invaluable because it posits a site and mode of cultural resistance, modernist studies can equally benefit from her observation that these are forcibly produced cultural and geographical territories that owe their existence to material and discursive histories of expansionism and neoliberalism.

<p>
Jos&eacute; David Sald&iacute;var refers to the borderlands as a "<i>transfrontera</i> contact zone," a "social space of subaltern encounters, the Janus-faced border line in which peoples geopolitically forced to separate themselves now negotiate with one another and manufacture new relations, hybrid cultures, and multiple-voiced aesthetics."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Sald&iacute;var stresses that hybridity and cultural negotiations are rooted in "the <i>uneven</i> power relations between national entities" (<i>BM,</i> 14; emphasis added). In his analysis of the writings of the nineteenth-century re Captain John Gregory Bourke, he suggests that North American ethnographic discourses have historically reinforced cultural asymmetries through an "objectification of everything alien and weird and exotic about the contact group"(<i>BM,</i> 166). Most frequently, Sald&iacute;var argues, that reification is accomplished through Africanist tropes which, thanks to ethnographic anthropology and colonialist expedition, are culturally legible as representational modes grounded in power hierarchies. Bourke Africanizes the borderlands' indigenous population and topography, and so projects his primacy as observer and generates a decontextualization of both "the African jungle and the <i>frontera</i> of Nuestra Am&eacute;rica [that] all but effaces the local inhabitants of both continents"(<i>BM,</i> 167). Well into the era of literary modernism, poets as diverse as Stevens, Hart Crane, Elizabeth Bishop, and Charles Olson negotiate the strategies and asymmetries of representing cultural differences in the Americas via Africanist tropes.

<p>
Stevens presents a peculiar case because his "fabliau of Florida" exoticizes the southern borderlands in order to render tropicality more familiar to white North American audiences. During his first visit to Miami in 1916, Stevens wrote to his wife that he thought Florida was foundationally strange and alien, but one could quickly adapt to the terrain's apparent tropical differences. "You soon grow accustomed to the palms. The soil is utterly different from ours" (<i>LWS,</i> 192). Two days later he would feel comfortable enough to conclude that "Florida is not really amazing in itself but in what it becomes under cultivation," and adds that "the ordinary jungle is not impressive" (ibid<i>.</i>). Unlike the Africanist primitivism of "The Greenest Continent" (<i>Owl's Clover,</i> 1936), 
<b></b>
Stevens's Floridean "jungle" does not resemble "spangling greens," nor is it populated by "fallen forest-men / Forever hunting or hunted" in "the jungle shine"; indeed, Florida is curiously depopulated (<i>OP,</i> 86). Without an indigenous or a racialized population, Stevens can turn it into a screen upon which he can poetically project his own desires. It is a tabula rasa which he imagines to be set apart from the rest of the South and free of the unnerving racial encounters that Stevens experiences during his travels elsewhere.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 As such, Stevens can "cultivate" Florida and enlist it as a space where he might address the gender dimensions of his national project, a space where he can prove that the virility of his ideal modernist poet is unimpeded by the specters of race.

<p>
But race is not wholly erased; instead, the space of Florida itself assumes traces of racial overdetermination due to Stevens's persistent use of primitivist tropes. For instance, the narrator of "Fabliau of Florida" (c.1919) tries to sublimate race by urging a "Barque of phosphor" harbored at "the palmy beach," "Fill your black hull / With white moonlight" (<i>CP,</i> 23). He orders the ship's platonic transformation to "Move outward into heaven," to ascend from sea to sky, from reality to image. As it moves from a tableau to a fabliau, the ship leaves behind the scene's "black" social foundations. In its wake, "Sultry moon-monsters / Are dissolving," an observation that poetically associates actual climate conditions with an eroticized fairy-tale monstrosity. In these two short lines, Stevens strongly invokes <i>The Tempest,</i> a romance of art's confrontation with colonialism, slavery, and resistance. His "moon-monsters" allude to Shakespeare's Caliban, the "mooncalf" of African descent (his mother, Sycorax, was exiled from Algiers), enslaved by Prospero for his attempted rape of Miranda. Because the "Sultry moon-monsters / Are dissolving," the narrator seems to have achieved a mastery of Prospero's art. Unlike the magus whose artful masque dissolves when he suddenly remembers Caliban's revolution (Act IV Scene 1), Stevens's narrator claims an art strong enough to dissolve the reminders of the social conditions' racial strife before it has a chance to interrupt the poem's aesthetic magic. Yet the apparent ease with which the poem seems to transcend the realities and romances of race is belied by the simple fact that the image is actually an illusion that will need to be repeated. "There will never be an end / To this droning of the surf." Florida's realities persist and supply an inevitable and inarticulate "droning" that will always have to be artfully sublimated. There is no reason to read blackness in the "droning of the surf," but the Floridean space becomes racialized by the same art and literary allusions used by Stevens to wipe it clean of signs of social strife.

<p>
Elsewhere, Stevens minimizes primitivism's racialized traces by relying less on romance and forcible literary transformation and instead realistically incorporating the cross-cultural elements of this borderlands. In a sense, the poet tries to let the borderlands speak for itself. In the apostrophic ode, "O Florida, Venereal Soil" (c.1922), Stevens attempts to salvage a catalog of "A few things for themselves," which will allow the borderlands to attest to his poetic virility without his need to resort to primitivist metaphor and its instantiation of racial asymmetries (<i>CP,</i> 47-8). The narrator prods Florida to speak of flora and fauna drawn from a variety of American spaces, ranging from a New England meadow to the Southwestern desert to the Florida Keys: "Convolvulus 
<b></b>
and coral, / Buzzards and live-moss, / Tiestas from the keys." Collected in the borderlands, these nouns are no longer mere natural markers of regional American identities; their juxtaposition accentuates how they could insinuate death and sexuality. "Vulva" is encrypted in "convolvulus" (herbs from the morning glory family), and the enigmatic "tiestas" misappropriates Spanish (<i>tiestos</i> are earthenware flowerpots) and encrypts the male genitals ("testes"). Gender and cultural differences are legible on the very surface of the words depicting North America's topographical heterogeneity, but their bricolage on Florida's "venereal soil" only subtly inflects them with undesired qualities. We hear erotic murmurs of the gender concerns underlying Stevens's poetic, but nothing is particularly indicative of his perpetuation of gendered power structures.

<p>
It would be fallacious to rely on the feminine personification of the landscape as an argument for the poem's apparent gender asymmetries. After all, Florida resists and refuses to give the narrator the sort of confession of her "nature" that he solicits. <i>Her</i> list of "A few things for themselves" details ethnic and racial populations, the "dreadful sundry of this world." Her answer exposes the narrator as desiring natural history so that his poem might avoid the perils of demographic documentation and undesirable social hierarchies. She tells him of,



<blockquote>

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[ellipses Stevens's]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the huddled masses who pass through Ellis Island, Florida's "dreadful sundry" are foreign presences that surface from within an American milieu. Personified as a "Virgin of boorish births," the borderlands nurtures a diverse ethnic brood that ranges from archetypes (The Cuban) to named individuals (Polodowsky). The African American "undertaker" is the most storied re. Handling dead bodies and fishes to "kill" a time measured in "corpses," his ominous and racialized presence produces a fatal distraction. Indeed, the ineluctable caesura visually manifest in the ellipse almost brings the poem to a premature end by forcing the amorous narrator into a preternatural pause. If the borderlands speaks for itself, it risks producing a distinctly American narrative of ethnic and racial diversity, but its "boorish" (swine-like, crude, insensitive) cultural production risks generating an undesirable, absolute foreignness proximate to aesthetic death.

<p>
Stevens's narrator rails against Florida, charging her with full responsibility for the racialized catalog. "Lasciviously as the wind, / You come tormenting, / Insatiable." His accusations confuse eroticism for the <i>cause</i> of the appearance of disidentificatory racialism when eroticism actually is an <i>effect</i> of the poet's decision to cultivate Florida as an erotic space, to project a venereal persona upon the borderlands' landscape. Stevens's invocation of William Carlos Williams indicates that even the lyric modernist desires an objectivist ideal for poetry, to become a "scholar of darkness" removed from a domestic racial scene and able to reflect upon it at a comfortable distance in tranquility. Spaces cannot 
<b></b>
speak for themselves if the poet is to fulfill his virile role as a forger of national identity. The disappointed narrator assumes an authoritative voice in the last stanza to control this "Donna, donna, dark." "Conceal yourself or disclose / Fewest things to the lover." In the end, neither option&#8212;to clothe her racialized "dark" self or to restrict what she discloses&#8212;is on the table. Florida is only allowed to "disclose" one thing: "A hand that bears a thick-leaved fruit, / A pungent bloom against your shade." An incredible masturbatory image, this onanistic phallus, under the direct control of the poetic hand, shields the narrator from and is wielded "against" the "shade" of Florida's proximity to American racial realities.

<p>
The borderlands do not provide a reliable resource that will corroborate one's poetic virility like a good "lover" because it nurtures unpredictable cultural differences with which a white audience may not be able to identify. Even if difference is born in a domestic American space, Stevens's target audience is not reflected in its archetypes ("The Cuban," "The Mexican women") or in its meaningless names lacking biographies ("Polodowsky"); the narrative of the only re possessing a semblance of a story ("the negro undertaker") is so moribund that it actually encourages the audience's disidentification. In order to make Florida useful, Stevens decides to align its tropical elements more closely with a Hispanic presence. These ethnically different actors can speak on Florida's behalf, preemptively disabling any erotic eruptions that make it evident that the poet has lost control of his subject as so happens when his actors are African American. Just as the boundaries between the two nations existed in a state of relative flux for three decades because of the Platt Amendment, cultural differences between <i>lo norteamericano</i> and <i>lo cubano</i> are permeable rather than absolute in Stevens's poetry during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The borderlands becomes a more familiar space, whose occupants provide res with whom Stevens's target readers can relate and with whom they might even be able to identify themselves. He moves away from primitivist representational strategies toward a <i>populating</i> strategy, which places Hispanic res on the same poetic stage as his white narrators.

<p>
Often his narrators urge Hispanic res to speak, an ability which would distinguish them from most of his African American res. Simple conversation promises to open possibilities for a truly intersubjective exchange that could have positive consequences for expanding definitions of American masculinity. In his early experiments with such staged dialogues, the poet relies upon indeterminate markers of racial difference that reproduce power structures and ultimately prevent Caribbean subjects who are still linked to a primitivist Floridean topography from speaking for themselves. One early example of such frustrated communication occurs in <i>Harmonium</i>'s "Two res in Dense Violet Night"  (<i>CP,</i> 85-6). The poem's speaker encourages the other, "Be the voice of night and Florida in my ear. / Use dusky words and dusky images. / Darken your speech." The racial implications of such "dusky words" are apparent, and they signal Stevens's consciousness that his social project might benefit from an appropriation of racial dialect that transgressively incorporates cultural difference and demonstrates the author's sovereign control over his materials.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Yet, he retracts the request right after he makes it.

<b></b>
<p>
Instead, the narrator opts to imagine an intercourse that refines his interlocutor's actual speech, and he "Conceiv[es] words" and speaks "perfectly" on the other's behalf, "in [his] thoughts." Using only the barest of resources, including the seascape's "<i>droning</i> sibilants" (emphasis added) (reminiscent of "the drone of the surf" in "Fabliau of Florida"), he is able to imagine a "serenade." The speaker even puts words into his companion's mouth: "<i>Say,</i> puerile, that the buzzards crouch on the ridge-pole," "<i>Say</i> that the palms are clear in a total blue" (emphasis added). Lacking sense ("the palms . . . / Are clear and are obscure") and erasing traces of the actual setting's sibilants (aspirated "s" sounds only occur in "say" and "obscure"), the narrator models a form of speech that evinces his power and command of language but fails to communicate any message. The reader may perceive a virile poetic potency, but how does such prosperous artfulness affect American social structures?

<p>
Set in that part of the South where Stevens rarely takes notice of African Americans, it is plausible that "Two res" wants to introduce a different sort of "native" speech&#8212;an hispanicized speech of the borderlands. However, the mere suggestion that such a Caribbean speech is "darken[ed]" disrupts the possibility of establishing Florida as a stable site from which Stevens might produce a poetic virility, to say what he and his narrator want said. Metaphorically rendered as an exercise in "<i>Conceiving</i> words, // As the night <i>conceives</i> the sea-sounds in silence" (emphasis added) the solicited process of shared poetic production is overdetermined by an insistence that this joint effort be reproductive, a <i>conception</i> rather than a <i>conceptualization</i>. Although we have no positive affirmation of the silent re's gender, the word "puerile" could be read as an appositive that bears Latinate traces of "boy" (<i>puer</i>). By forcibly maintaining the respondent's silence, the narrator wards off unnatural verbal intercourse, a consequence that would be as unseemly as taking the boy's "moist hand." His solicitation of "darken[ed]" speech is nothing less than a proposition, a language-game proposed in lieu of an averted intimacy between two res. If this is a scene intended to confirm poetic virility, it falls rather short of its goal. It is culturally comprehensible as "virile" only because the narrator wards off another male's possible sexual advances. This spurning does not truly straighten the narrator, though, since he continues to play flirtatious games that barely sublimate their meeting's erotic excesses. After all, he does ask his companion to whisper his racialized speech "in my ear"!

<p>
In his later writing, Stevens attempts to refine the failed dialogic model of "Two res" through explicitly Hispanic characters. If the interlocutors are visible, unobscured by any "dense violet night," the social significances of their interactions might be more legible and less subject to scurrilous interpretation. Consequently, they would provide more suitable testimony to the poet's virility. <i>Ideas of Order</i> is the apogee of Stevens's integration of Caribbean topoi into his poetry. No longer a disguise or a mask (as in "Revolutionists") or an archetype ("The Cuban" of "O Florida, Venereal Soil") or an implied presence (as in "Two res"), <i>lo cubano</i> is embodied as a distinct character who is addressed, engaged, and (most importantly) named. Preserving the integrity of Cuban individuals is tantamount to inviting them into a democratic exchange between familiars. In these poems, poetic virility is achieved by nurturing a 
<b></b>
cultural pluralism that reaches across the republics' boundaries to invite cross-cultural identifications, rather than insisting upon an overly controlling homogenization of American culture.

<p>
In "Academic Discourse at Havana" (c.1933), Stevens constructs intimate and personalized characterizations of Cuban individuals that facilitate a white reader's identification with a more expansive American community (<i>CP,</i> 142-5).  For instance, when he writes that "Grandmother and her basketful of pears / Must be the crux of our compendia," he suggests a kinship between the narrator and this woman simply by calling her "Grandmother." Due to the narrator's familiar and familial address, she is no longer apart from North American communities but connected to them via the transcultural poetic liason of the narrator. If the poet is able to preserve cultural difference without eradicating cross-identification, there is social legitimacy and virility to be found in poetic enterprise. The historical potency of the poet is guaranteed because he opens up vistas for reimagining national identity rather than constructing enclosures and exclusions that delimit identities and create rifts between factions of the national community. Surrendering some control, giving the individual reader's imagination more room for free play, reflects positively upon Stevens's primary concern for expanding the poet's culturally legible masculinity. In "Academic Discourse," the poet's speech really can stir his audience. "But let the poet on his balcony / Speak and the sleepers in their sleep shall move."

<p>
"The Idea of Order at Key West" (c.1935) moves the cross-cultural vignettes of "Academic Discourse at Havana" off the Cuban isle and into the Floridean borderlands (<i>CP,</i> 128-30). The narrator twice calls by name the Hispanic re with whom he shares his reflections on an anonymous singing woman. First, he is directly addressed as "Ramon Fernandez," a significant announcement of his ethnicity.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 When he is named a second time, he is simply called "pale Ramon." The modifier "pale" is superfluous in the poem's context of a casual conversation, but it does mark a difference in Ramon's and the narrator's complexions and indicates the interlocutor's <i>criollo</i> rather than possibly African descent. Ramon doubles for Stevens's own audience, the re with whom readers might identify and thereby implicitly expand the possibilities of North American readership. Stevens feels so secure in his narrator's distance from racial disturbances that the conversation is presented as a reflection upon a past event ("She sang beyond the genius of the sea"). If the poet felt that ethnic difference threatened the stability of his narrator's lyric position or his audience's ability to identify with Ramon, Stevens could have written about the spectacle as staged in the present. Two heterosexual men enraptured by, or perhaps struggling over, a common female object would defuse possible homoerotic readings inspired by perceived erotic excesses in a racially overdetermined relationship.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Coexisting without any need for the narrator to assert masculine superiority, the two res of "The Idea of Order at Key West" establish a vignette in which the borderlands is for once devoid of erotic symptoms of racial strife and social disorder.

<p>
The singing woman supplies reinforcing proof that it is possible to transform "venereal" Florida into a neutral American site. Because of her skill, her song and the waves 
<b></b>
remain independent entities, and the landscape is not touched by nor does it adversely affect aesthetic composition. "The water never formed to mind or voice, / Like a body wholly body, fluttering / Its empty sleeves." The songstress's identity as artist is not imperiled by the site at which she sings. "[S]he was the maker of the song she sang," and "The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea / Was merely a place by which she walked to sing." The spatially denotative prepositional phrases in the poem (the "at Key West" of the title; the "place by which she walked" above) do not bear any additional significances. Compositional sites are merely the locations of cultural production; as such, Stevens seems to have hit upon a depiction of the borderlands from which he might construct a virile poetic without stirring up destabilizing racial hierarchies or using primitivist tropes.

<p>
By describing the formless sea as "Like a body wholly body," the narrator acknowledges the fecund materiality of nature; yet he manages to negate its influence on the woman's song by using a simile that reduces the sea to an object that merely resembles a body. Because the sea waves its "empty sleeves," its materiality is erased and eroticism is inoculated. Stevens produces a sound stage of the borderlands where he can enact his gender drama in "Theatrical distances." Performed in this space, the woman's song is "more" than "the dark voice of the sea / That rose, or even colored by many waves." Descriptions of the setting as "dark" and "colored" register a racial presence, but the doubled sense of the verb "rose" suggests that the chanteuse widens the spectrum so that "color" moves beyond racial and toward aesthetic significances. Her ability to separate herself from a racialized and embodied borderlands is visually reinforced by an amazing linear disjunction:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[. . .] But it was more than that,


<br />
More even than her voice, and ours, among

<br />
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,

<br />
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped

<br />
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres

<br />
Of sky and sea.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was her voice that made

<br />
The sky acutest at its vanishing.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The geography's "dark voice" and its "meaningless plungings of water and the wind" evoke a sexual thrusting, but this sonic and copulative "plunging" is just "meaningless" murmuring that contrasts with the woman's articulate song, "uttered word by word." Since she has managed to keep her song distinct from and more audible than the soundscape ("it was she and not the sea we heard"), Florida is just a scenic backdrop of "bronze shadows," another indication of how her performance moves beyond racial toward aesthetic coloration. The two sources of sound are visually set apart by the fissuring of the line, where Stevens dramatically separates the background noise "Of sky and / sea" from "her voice." There is no danger, neither aurally nor visually, that race and aesthetics might mix: "The song and water were not medleyed sound."

<p>
The woman's song has a generative power not unlike the potent power of Stevens's idealized virile poet. She is "the single artificer of the world / <i>In</i> which she sang" (emphasis added), <b></b> and her act of aesthetic production creates her own space. Although her song is a theatrical production like the mythopoetic performance proposed in "Revolutionists," her song does not detract attention away from political events; instead, she masters her actual surroundings and endows "whatever self" the sea once had with a new identity, "the self / That was her song, for she was the maker." Furthermore, her song demonstrates an historical force because it continues to affect the narrator's and Ramon's imaginations. But her positive example raises more questions than it answers: Why is the most potent and "virile" of Stevens's early poet-res a woman? And why is it necessary for "pale Ramon" to be present at all if Stevens wants his narrator only to bear witness to the potency of her song?

<p>
The complexities of this meditation on the borderlands as a space of virile poetic production hinge on the poem's mediated nature, how the text itself intervenes in the reader's perception of the phenomenological event described by the narrator. Such graphic indicators as the fractured line that syntactically and graphically segregates "her voice" from the "sky and sea" draw the reader's attention to the degree to which Stevens manages his poetic material. As the narrator remarks, "it was more than that, / More even than her voice, and ours, among / The meaningless plungings of water and the wind" that lends her song its historical force. The poet is the external force who arranges the poem's telling; Stevens himself is the "more than that" who endows his materials force and supercedes the re of the singing woman as "the maker of the song she sang." Not unlike the mythic Orpheus, her song exists only in a second- or third-hand narration of its effects.

<p>
The presence of "pale Ramon" is necessary because he provides an audience who can corroborate the narrator's version of events and who can confirm that the borderlands may provide a transcultural aesthetic space unaffected by destabilizing racial associations. The two onlookers share the knowledge that the woman sings out of necessity. "As we beheld her striding there alone, / Knew that there never was world for her / Except the one she sang and, singing, made." Her example is the allegory through which Stevens conveys his message that aesthetic composition begins with an estrangement from the world. But the poem's mediation refocuses the reader's attention not on the singer or her song but on its reception and its effects, namely the secure homosocial alliance that redefines the nature of American community. During their reverie, Ramon and the narrator presumably share and communicate an empowering knowledge that art can facilitate the recomposition of the social order, and their commiseration concretizes the "reality" of this new order for the reader.

<p>
The mediated presentation of "The Idea of Order at Key West," however, contradicts its utopic message and exacerbates the social hierarchies upon which the poem rests. The poem itself is eerily prescient of one of the <i>Adagia</i>: "A poet looks at the world somewhat as a man looks at a woman." The lyric's series of mediations (a text that imagines a small community of men who imagine looking at a woman, who herself is capable of assuming her own powerfully imaginative stance in relation to the world) prevents any facile comparison of erotic or even of gender dynamics; however, the poem and the adage do share a reliance upon general asymmetries in intersubjective 
<b></b>
structures of experience. If the songstress's power is truly effective, the aesthetic space she creates should support a new homosocial community among equals. The narrator implores his companion to corroborate his story and to explain how material objects continue the work of the song. After the song ended, why did they believe "the glassy lights" of banal fishing vessels "Mastered the night and portioned out the sea, / Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles"? How did the solitary woman's song enchant the actual American borderlands and allow it to redefine its own limits and to transform signs of an incendiary eroticism into markers of civility? How might they continue to benefit from "the maker's rage to order," a power of language that enables the reimagination "of ourselves and of our origins"? Stevens's speaker pleads, "Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know." But Ramon remains silent.

<p>
This unbroken silence attests to Stevens's ambivalence about the borderlands, an ambivalence rooted in a nation's uncertainty about whether a Hispanic culture might be invited into North America's national community without further disrupting the sense of the nation's identity and historical force. Dialogue might indicate cultural differences. In a text that compares the borderlands to a theatrical stage, one cannot help but wonder, how would Ramon sound? Would he speak with dangerously "dusky words," as in "Two res"? Or, would he truly be able to elaborate cultural commonalities that cross divides of difference through the fantasy of "ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds"? Although this community consists only of two people (three, at the most, if we distinguish between Stevens and the narrator), it constitutes a microcosmic institution, an <i>idea of order</i>, articulated through the intimate discourse of two males who share some common ground. But Ramon's silence speaks volumes, indicating an uncertainty on the part of the poetic arranger, Stevens, as to whether the two diverse res can ever belong to the same community.

<p>
Through the period including <i>Ideas of Order,</i> Stevens introduces Cuban and Hispanic subjects to demonstrate that a national literature he believed to be defined in part by racial tensions could expand and cross cultural lines without referencing a racial distress that would disturb the poet's "virile," or historical, force. Capitalizing on the historical and discursive structures that blurred the borders between Cuba and the United States, he creates a borderlands space in order to find some community in his Americas which might help him successfully affect social identities. Certainly he tries time and again, in a number of different ways, to make the Hispanic an effective apparatus, even an effective companion, in these endeavors. But Stevens's poetry evinces an uncertainty as to whether the racial, cultural, and even topographical likenesses between North Americans and Cubans were sufficient to forge a new sense of American poetic masculinity. Even "The Idea of Order at Key West," which comes closest to containing racial difference, cannot shake its dependence on a forcibly expansionist production of the borderlands. In 1926, in the shadow of the land boom and almost ten years before he wrote "The Idea of Order at Key West," Stevens was already bemoaning Florida's loss of innocence. Then he felt that the "colonial period of five or ten years ago" was threatened, and he hoped that it might "re-emerge" so it would "be possible to be at one's ease again" (<i>LWS,</i> 247). A similar colonialist nostalgia inflects 
<b></b>
Stevens's later desire to give Ramon personality and voice. Hispanic masculinity still remains racially other (Ramon, after all, is only "pale," not "white"), and Cuba's political and economic infrastructures remain under the sway of U.S. cultural imperialism. Consequently, the very differences that Stevens may have found useful stand in the way of his ability to reimagine a new national community grounded upon an equitable and dialogic relationship between men across a cultural divide. Stevens's desire is structured and problematized by the ambivalences of the historical moment, and so he silences the Hispanic voice before it can interrupt his narrator's reverie with the "dusky words" for which he longed but was afraid to hear.

In <i>Genders, Races, and Religious Cultures in Modern American Poetry, 1908-1934</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001), Rachel Blau DuPlessis notes that "Stevens created his own Negro Renaissance&#8212;a pretend world peopled by colored res enacting muse-like dramas" . DuPlessis reads the general primitivism of these dramas as the poet's nullifying response to the New Negro movement's promise of social redemption; he composes "a new nation" that reverses the Great Migration and returns black Americans to the rural South from the urban North . For her complete reading, see pages 118-23. For an extended treatment, see DuPlessis, "'Darken Your Speech': Racialized Cultural Work of Modernist Poets," in <i>Reading Race in American Poetry: "An Area of Act,"</i> ed.

For a similar discussion of the conservatism underlying Stevens's "destructive character," see Andrew Lakritz's <i>Modernism and the Other in Stevens, Frost, and Moore</i> (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1996). Lakritz argues that Stevens illustrates how the "allotrope" (the writing of the other) produces "rhetorical strategies of dislocation and displacement&#8212;so that the normative stories we tell about our culture might be disrupted and liquidated" . His attempts to generate a new social order still rely upon a language that is embedded in the stereotypical myths of the "old" world. Any revolutionary or creative aim, then, depends upon some conservative rhetorical stance.

Historian Gail Bederman explains that discourses constructing white masculinity in the early-twentieth century revolved around the murderously violent control that white males exhibited over black men who were thought to be "uncivilized, unmanly rapists, unable to control their sexual desires." <i>Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880-1997</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995), 46. I am prone to read any signs of erotic anxiety in Stevens's poetry as an <i>effect rather than a cause</i> for the text at hand; his primary anxiety concerns a racialized struggle over defining "American" poetic virility. When eroticism erupts, it is an index, not an explanation, for a loss of control and a destabilization of presumedly secure power asymmetries.

On the surface, Stevens's troping of racial and ethnic differences seems culturally imperialist. According to Edward Said, "the formation of cultural identities [ought to be] understood not as essentializations (although part of their enduring appeal is that they seem and are considered to be essentializations) but as contrapuntal ensembles, for it is the case that no identity can ever exist by itself and without some array of opposites, negatives, oppositions: Greeks always require barbarians, and Europeans Africans, Orientals, etc." <i>Culture and Imperialism</i> (New York: Vintage, 1993), 52. Upon closer examination, though, Stevens problematizes Said's concept of the "contrapuntal" because he depicts a fraternity and a continuum of racial likeness between North American and Latin American res.

Explicit Hispanic elements can be found in "The Comedian as the Letter C" (and its earlier version, "From the Journal of Crispin"), "O Florida, Venereal Soil," "The Cuban Doctor," "The Idea of Order at Key West," "Academic Discourse at Havana," "The Woman Who Blamed Life on a Spaniard," "Arrival at the Waldorf," "Mrs. Alfred Uruguay," "The Search for Sound Free from Motion," "The Pure Good of Theory," "A Word with Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez-Feo," "Description without Place," "Attempt to Discover Life," "The Pastor Caballero," "The Novel," and the one-act play "Carlos among the Candles." Less obvious examples include "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction," "Infernale," "Architecture," "The Load of Sugar Cane," "A Duck for Dinner" (<i>Owl's Clover</i>), and the Florida poems.

<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
I read Stevens's treatment of the Hispanic after <i>Ideas of Order</i> as distinct from his earlier work. During his correspondence with the Cuban editor Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez Feo (1944-55), Stevens sees Cuba as no longer populated only by res who corroborate his "supreme fiction" of masculinity but by an <i>audience of other artists.</i> He subscribed to the vanguardist magazine <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> through Rodr&iacute;guez Feo, and the Cuban editor published several translations of his poetry. How <i>lo cubano</i> interfaced with sexual and gender identities in this later exchange is problematized by Rodr&iacute;guez Feo's homosexuality, which Stevens may or may not have intuited. The North American's poetic did provide a model for Jos&eacute; Lezama Lima and other members of the <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> vanguard who sought to "virilize" gay Cuban masculinity. For a full discussion of Stevens's middle period, Cuba, and masculine sexual identities, see Eric Keenaghan, "Wallace Stevens's Influence on the Construction of Gay Masculinity by the Cuban <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> Group," <i>The Wallace Stevens Journal</i> 24, no. 2 : 187-207.

As late as 1945, Stevens would treat Cuba as a foreign space related to but not wholly part of the United States. When commenting on <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> in 1945, he wrote Rodr&iacute;guez Feo that "<i>for the reader of the exterior,</i> what is of particular interest [in the journal] is the Cubans themselves." <i>Secretaries of the Moon: The Letters of Wallace Stevens and Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez-Feo,</i> ed. Beverly Coyle and Alan Filreis (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1986), 35; emphasis added. When he exteriorizes Cuba, he tends to dehistoricize its culture. For instance, he notes that "Mariano [Rodr&iacute;guez]'s happy little drawings" in <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> "touch" him. "Nothing quite so <i>unconcerned</i> has come my way for a long time. Man's fever is not present here" . His patronizing attitude dissociates the island from the global crisis ("fever") of World War I. Artistically, culturally, and politically, his idea of Cuba is a safe space to which one may turn to escape the present. This quasi-primitivist imperialism is tempered with a desire to see Rodr&iacute;guez Feo and the <i>or&iacute;genistas</i> abandon cosmopolitanism and develop an art that visibly marks their cultural differences from Euro-American modernisms.

Stevens never learned Spanish. In 1945 he wrote Rodr&iacute;guez Feo that he "wish[ed] with all the excitement of a real wish that [he] knew Spanish much better" so that he might be able to appropriate a certain "freshness" from Latin American cultures. "One grows tired of the familiar res and to be able to find a fresh mind in a Mexican critic [like Alfonso Reyes, whom Rodr&iacute;guez Feo had mentioned in a previous letter], or in the many writers in South America, and elsewhere in the Spanish-speaking countries, for which one would feel an instinctive respect would be a real excitement. It is, however, much too late for me to attempt to become really familiar with another language." <i>Secretaries of the Moon,</i> 40. His lack of knowledge, however, does not stop him from ordering Reyes's books, acquiring them as he had many foreign objets d'art. "True, I shall not be able to read them, but I shall get something out of them" . Despite his intentions, Stevens does not wholly escape the asymmetries of imperialism, since he culls Spanish-language texts for raw material that he can use to produce a "fresh" polyglot text in a hispanicized American English.

A sense of how Stevens associated Southern social decline with racial strife is clear in a 1930 letter he wrote to James A. Powers upon returning to Connecticut from Jackson, Mississippi. "I thought the town delightful&#8212;<i>so surprisingly neat and so unexpectedly full of vigor.</i> What a pity that <i>those people</i> don't have the knack of putting themselves across and of throwing the light of the truth on themselves! <i>A few demagogues ruin the reputation of an entire race</i>" (<i>LWS,</i> 259; emphasis added). His surprise at the "vigor" discovered in Jackson attests to his inescapable precepts about black subjects and what he felt to be their contribution to (or responsibility for) the decline of Southern culture. Stevens excises African American populations from most of his Florida poems in order to ensure a sense of stability for his own imaginatively ordered worlds.

In <i>The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language and Twentieth-Century Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), Michael North argues that such "dusky words" and "dusky images" in white American modernisms "advance racial and linguistic diversity as a wedge in [modernists'] campaign against English and New Englandish domination" by contesting those movements that sought to standardize American English . But these writers resort to "the racial alien" who functions as "a cipher" ("natural, primitive, life-affirming, and impatient of restraint") in order to disrupt culturally homogenous representations . For North, the discomforting paradox of "reproduc[ing]" "racial hatred" through the cipher is an <i>effect</i> of a poetic that attempts "racial cross-identification" . I believe, however, that we should credit Stevens and other modernists with some consciousness of the problems of the cipher and the re's reduction of the subject to ideological and stereotypical narratives that make him or her an "it" that is readily <i>legible,</i> totally comprehended upon sight. The poetic deployment of such ciphers would not be <i>useful</i> if modernists were not somewhat conscious of their implicit contradictions.

Ram&oacute;n Fernandez was an actual historical personality, a Mexican-born critic who contributed to the <i>Nouvelle revue fran&ccedil;aise</i>, the <i>Partisan Review,</i> and the <i>Criterion.</i> James Longenbach suggests that Stevens uses the politically outspoken critic's name to assert his own "interest in the ambiguity of ideas." <i>Wallace Stevens: The Plain Sense of Things</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 161. Despite the fact that "most of Stevens's readers will know that Fernandez was a critic familiar to Stevens" , I am seizing upon the very ambiguity of the <i>idea</i> of the <i>hispanidad</i> of Fernandez's name, his Latin American <i>personality</i> (Fernandez had dual citizenship in both Mexico and France), and his poetic transposition from Europe to Florida. In the borderlands, the actual Fernandez is a cross-cultural, Hispanic trope whose connections to French literature and culture only concretize the transnational continuities and cultural bridges connecting North American and Latino/Caribbean cultures.

I forgo the complexities that would arise if I were to read the poem in light of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's homosocial triangle, put forth in <i>Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), esp. 21-27. A better example of homosociality can be found in "New England Verses," in which Stevens immediately moves from the direct address of the "Dark cynic" in "The Male Nude" section to the objectified representation of Ballatta in the subsequent section, "The Female Nude" (<i>CP,</i> 104-6).
