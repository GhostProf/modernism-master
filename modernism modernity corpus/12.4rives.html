The second novel in Mary Butts's 1928 <i>Taverner Novels </i>series, <i>The Death of Felicity Taverner,</i> repeatedly returns to the topic of how to correctly possess things, lauding a style of ownership that blends "passion and detachment" . For Butts, one's affective relation to what one possesses defines an ethics and politics, a lifestyle. The Taverners, Butts writes, did "not tire of real things once they  . . .  got them home to play with" . In praising the family, Butts does not simply define their "real things" as authentic objects, instead of spurious imitations or copies. Rather, here Butts understands a "real thing" as an empirical surface, perceptible to touch, sight and smell:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

The polish on a horse's coat, the china-red lacquer of Adrian's car, two shots as a half-mirror, were to them surfaces as pleasant as petal or silk. . . . Like others of our age, they had re-discovered also the still-life, that, however it may get itself painted, it is not <i>nature mort</i>, but that each haphazard arrangement can be composed of formal perfections of shape and light&#x02014;plates on a table, a basket of folded linen, a sea-scape off the beach in a glass dish.

<div class="attribution">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
In describing these surfaces, Butts's prose lovingly creates its own still-life, placing each object in reference to a composition of "formal perfections." This formal symmetry occurs in a world 

<b></b>

where the walls of a habitation are "in their place again" when a "shining room" is "charged-up with pain" . For Butts, the affective life of an interior works paradoxically; in the ideal spatial scenario, the fixed, precise, and demarcated arrangement of concrete things encourages a more fluid state of empathic connection.  
</p>

<p>
Butts's concern for the lives of objects broaches a number of important critical and conceptual issues, both theoretically and in terms of modernism more specifically. The purpose of this argument is twofold: to understand Butts's significance to modernism and to determine what her presentation of object life might contribute to critical thought more generally. In what follows, I argue that Butts's fiction counter-intuitively emphasizes the role of a grounded or situated object-life in theorizing empathy as an idealized synthesis of "passion and detachment" . Butts's modernism consistently addresses how to properly place objects in order to develop a form of affective attachment that preserves the discrete integrity of those objects. However severe Butts's real-life affective failures, which ranged from her abandonment of her daughter to the hatefulness she directed towards her mother, her novels and short stories emphasize how humans might affectively attach themselves to the object world, particularly through a form of private possession that avoids reifying its objects.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In focusing on the art of placing objects, Butts's work foregrounds a second area of concern: the relation between empathy, the proper placement of objects, and an appropriate style of ownership. Private possession, it appears, is essential for objects to remain both soluble and intact in their boundaries. In creating a diffuse sense of boundary, Butts's etiquette of placement de-privatizes the world of objects and humans, refusing to uphold a demarcated sense of subject and object. Paradoxically, this solubility develops precisely from the kinds of relations that arise from specific styles of private ownership. Butts's description of Felicity Taverner suggests that objects only become "possessions" when they are the subjects of "choice," through an idealized process that builds, rather than severs, the affective relation between these objects and their collectors. The passage I quoted above directly links Felicity's admired "passion and detachment," or her empathic abilities, to this exercise of choice, to her careful claiming of an object as her own.
</p>

<p>
In suggesting that empathic connections between animate and inanimate worlds only develop from some degree of attached and private ownership of objects, Butts's writing supports a critical idiom that extends beyond the question of who or what consumes these objects. Generally, theoretical studies of objects have operated by building an all-too-resolute relationship between market forces, private ownership, and consumption. Furthermore, such arguments often develop from the assumption that both subjects and objects resist their inevitable reification, and that escape from the pervasive forces of objectification requires that they completely remove themselves from the bonds of private ownership.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  This logic continues to form the basis of a number of arguments that attempt to contest cultural and sexual normativity in particular. That is, the idea that any phenomenologically grounded appearance commodifies the object in question reinforces another commonly held assumption that distance from a "biological basis" correlates with the "potential for doing justice to difference."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Butts's work offers an 

<b></b>

alternative to the frequent contention that the only escape from the inevitable commodification of objects lies in their utter de-privatization&#x02014;or freedom from the bonds of possession. For Butts, an utterly de-privatized object-life&#x02014;which liberates both objects and social relations from structures of private ownership&#x02014;often disables affective and empathic bonds. Instead, Butts's short stories and novels respond to a modernity that, as Rachel Bowlby claims, has erased all reference points for a collective emotional attachment. Ultimately Butts sees the basis for collective forms of empathy in a particular style of private ownership that dissolves the self, rather than solidifies it.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The few critical articles about Butts have generally focused on her exclusion from aesthetic modernism, but her unceasing devotion to things plants her more solidly within a modernism that was obsessed with the dimensions and lives of objects. This modernism includes writers as diverse as Oscar Wilde, Wyndham Lewis, Virginia Woolf, and Elizabeth Bowen. Aside from noting the fact that Butts's innovative, if at times obscure, prose was rejected by more prominent writers such as Virginia Woolf as "indecent," or by Marianne Moore as "out of harmony" with the aims of <i>The Dial</i>, critics have said little in regard to Butts's vociferous fictional and critical commentary on modernism (<i>MB:SL</i>, 188). Fueled by Nathalie Blondel's impressive biography, attention to Butts's work has been largely biographical, focusing on her critical recovery as a rambunctious personality, a writer of obscure and experimental prose, and a hanger-on to rather celebrated groups of gay men, which included such luminaries as Jean Cocteau.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  However, Butts's significance to modernism extends beyond her importance as an object of feminist recovery, or her reputation as a notorious personality&#x02014;a drug addict who traveled "astrally," a bad mother, and according to Wyndham Lewis, a "big carroty anglish intelligentsia  . . .  and buxom heiress" (<i>MB:SL</i>, 188). The dearth of criticism is complicated by Butts's exclusion from, and subsequent <i>resentiment</i> of, prominent modernist circles such as Gertrude Stein's and Virginia Woolf's, particularly because she offered what Bruce Hainley has called a "big Shut Up to much of modernism's nonsense and hush-hush."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Consequently, Butts's work remains difficult to recuperate within any central modernist paradigm. Yet her literary career&#x02014;as characterized by its odd web of affiliations, its financial insecurity and social exclusion&#x02014;provides important commentary on the often conflicting strands of influence and resentment that created what we now term literary modernism. As a woman, Butts most often categorized herself with modernists such as Eliot, Pound, and Lewis, who would later come to signify hygienic masculinity, rather than with her female contemporaries. In particular, Butts's prose tends to rework a set of issues that emerged much earlier in the discourse of imagism, concerning the relationship between the object world, scientific detachment, and aesthetic form.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In this process, she tends to re-situate this rather imagistic approach to the object-world within the parameters of the domestic sphere, reclaiming a space that, because of its connection to the feminine, had traditionally been repudiated by much of avant-garde cultural practice.
</p>

<p>
Critics of modernism have generally termed imagism's concern for the direct and grounded appearance of objects "empiricism." We are reminded of Ezra Pound's call 

<b></b>

in 1918 for "Direct treatment of the 'thing,' whether subjective or objective," and consequently tend to associate this ideal with detachment and masculinity.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Yet some of modernism's most virulently masculine res, such as Wyndham Lewis, tended to fault this excessive detachment. For example, in <i>Blast I </i>, Lewis opines that "lofty detachment from any utilitarian end or purpose" accounts for the deficiency of Picasso's latest series of sculptures, "[s]mall structures in cardboard, wood, zinc, glass string, etc."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In seeming contrast to Pound's call for "[d]irect treatment of the 'thing,'" Lewis suggests that little is gained from treating objects "[s]o directly so."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Lewis's essay actually problematizes the fact that these objects stand too intact in their boundaries, exhibiting little solubility in their relation to the human world. Despite the ostensible difference in Lewis's and Pound's opinions, Pound's conception of what constitutes "direct treatment" coincides more with Lewis's than one might expect. That is, his understanding of things does not function by severing the human and object worlds, but rather, by bringing them together.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
My concern here is not with whether Pound was rightly an empiricist, but with why his understanding of the "thing" is necessarily read as a doctrine of hygienic masculinity that separates subject from object. For example, Douglas Mao suggests that Lewis in particular affiliated himself with imagism, "which could look like yet another variety of insufficiently virile empiricism because it appeared to enshrine discerning perception and accurate transcription as the foundations of literary value" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 81). However, Lewis's understanding of empiricism was more complex than Mao would suggest, particularly in terms of gender. Mao tends to position Lewis within a gendered binary that inadequately characterizes modernism in terms of its treatment and theory of objects, so that a less direct treatment of the "thing" becomes characteristic of a more "feminine" style of perception. I argue here that intellectuals such as Butts further disturb the gendered binary assigned to the direct and indirect treatment of things, since she institutes her own brand of empiricism and "discerning perception" to build empathic relations that both narrow the gap between subjects and objects and preserve the discrete value of each being.
</p>

<p>
This critical politics&#x02014;which both genders empirical detachment and characterizes modernism as conservative and reactionary&#x02014;attends both classic and recent studies of modernism. Perhaps the most basic claim of Peter Nicholls's classic <i>Modernisms: A Literary Guide</i> is thatmodernism promoted detachment and apathy by affirming subject-object distinctions in its need to strengthen an "ironically anti-social position."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Nicholls's version of modernism, which too rigidly demarcates social and aesthetic space, has influenced a number of more recent studies that attempt to salvage modernist writers from accusations of such overt conservatism. In direct response to Nicholls, Mao claims that modernism often concerned itself with ensuring the "extra-subjective integrity" of the object, so that it could "take the part of this radical other without subordinating it to consciousness" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 10). This kind of ethical engagement with the object reveals anxiety over the "troubling <i>extensiveness</i> of human power" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 10). Such extensiveness may either invade the discrete territory of objects, as does Wyndham Lewis's command that we actively "substitute ourselves everywhere 

<b></b>

for the animal world," replacing the "tiger and the cormorant with some invention of our mind, so that we can intimately control this new creation," or conversely, it may encourage an overly detached and distanced relation to objects, designed to justify their exploitation. Both positions fail in managing a relationship to the object that is neither overly detached nor too invasive, a necessary aspect of maintaining an empathic relation to things.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Empathy continues to be read by many critics of the term as merely a form of sentimental and affective identification. For example, in analyzing abolitionist sentiment in nineteenth-century America, Saidiya V. Hartman defines empathy negatively as a "projection of oneself into another" that solidifies the self and exploits "the vulnerability of the captive body as a vessel for the uses, thoughts, and feelings of others."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Certainly, Hartman is right to fault this method of identification, but her version of empathy amounts to little more than a sentimentalized version of transference. Psychoanalytical accounts, such as Freud's, also tend to undermine the possibilities of empathy by focusing on acts of identification as castrating, invasive, or debilitating&#x02014;violent acts that cripple the productivity of affective bonds. The modernist version of empathy I employ here can be best understood in relation to questions of space&#x02014;in the sense that empathy diffuses the boundaries that separate objects and stabilize their identities. The work of philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty proves especially useful in illuminating these forms of empathy, particularly because phenomenology addresses how the precise arrangement of objects creates a sense of meaningful space&#x02014;space that coheres at the same time that it preserves the value and integrity of its separate components. In its critique of the Cartesian tradition, which separates the thinking subject from the external world, a phenomenological account of space best illustrates an ideal of empathy that builds upon a carefully managed spatial engagement with the object world. For example, Merleau-Ponty faults our tendency to "disengage from the object" through a movement in space that turns the subject into "nothing more than what it thinks it is."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  For an empathic relation to exist, a subject must be able to extend its own boundaries, but in a way that dissolves the self and identity, allowing both subject and object to become more than what they think they are. Empathy thus functions as a strange intimacy, where subjects and objects demonstrate their attachment to each other while preserving certain distances. Consequently, an empathic relation demands that things occupy definitive placement or grounding in relation to each other, so that feeling can lodge around specific "sticking points" without usurping the particular positioning of the external world.
</p>

<p>
Generally, empathy has been related to humanist sentiments and subjectivity, which explains Hartman's antipathy to the term. However, modernist treatments of empathy, such as Wilhelm Worringer's 1908 treatise "Abstraction and Empathy," which proves especially useful for understanding how empathy might form the basis of an aesthetic practice, move beyond humanism in connecting the term to a de-centered subject. Worringer reads the traditional meaning of empathy as related to a Platonic form of aesthetic subjectivism whereby the subject finds beauty in his ability to live himself out pantheistically in the forms around him. Worringer complicates this manner of apprehending

<b></b>

art by suggesting that each urge to empathy entails a corresponding abstraction of the subject. That is, the subject's desire to expand the self in apprehending the beautiful also coincides with its self-alienation, an abstraction that dissolves the self.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  This process is best illustrated by examples from Bill Brown's <i>A Sense of Things: The Object Matter of American Literature</i>, where Brown describes the development of the "life-group" exhibit in many museums of the early twentieth century. This development "supplemented 'a poetics of detachment' with a poetics of attachment, establishing contact between the singularized material object and a materialized human body. . . ."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  According to Brown, such scenes replaced serial displays with the "recreation of a scene of use&#x02014;a woman holding a single jug to bring water to her child," for example (<i>ST:OMAL</i>, 92). Brown especially emphasizes the welded "physical intimacy" that such a scene fosters (<i>ST:OMAL</i>, 93); however, other aspects of this scene are significant to modernist theories of objecthood. What is also interesting in this scenario is that the jug acts as a prosthetic extension of the human body itself, and to a certain extent, also points out the inadequacy of this body in negotiating the transfer of nourishment from mother to child. The vessel thus serves an empathic, somewhat self-alienating function that accords with Worringer's version of empathy, resisting the Platonic sentimentalization of art.

<p class="noIndent">
Modernist texts such as Butts's even more firmly reject sentimentality as a factor in the "physical intimacy" that characterizes an ethical and empathic relation to objects. Particularly as it relates to modernist conceptions of object life, this dual conception of empathy as both affirming and alienating offers a way of re-thinking the relationship between commodification and the ownership of objects. For example, while certain critics would dismiss Ezra Pound's call for "direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective" as stringently masculine, and antithetical to the values of intimacy and empathy, Pound's very concern for accuracy in perception and representation of "the thing," as its environment situates it, features prominently in the work of a number of women writing within the modernist period.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Take, for instance, critics and journalists such as Janet Flanner, the famed American expatriate and contributor to magazines such as <i>Harper's </i>and <i>The New Yorker</i>, whose journalism exposes the extent to which the fate of humanity was tied up in the location of the object. In the memoir she published in 1957, <i>Men and Monuments: Profiles of Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Malraux</i>, Flanner opines that the collecting frenzy inspired by the new fashion of private ownership had actually devalued art, as prices were in reality much lower than they had been a generation before. However, Flanner appears hard-pressed to imagine an alternative to a marketplace based on prestige and personal possession. Ultimately, the dystopic alternative she depicts at the end of <i>Men and Monuments</i> completely de-sacralizes the art world by fully divesting it of ownership.
</p>

<p>
For Flanner, art lost its home through the Nazi looting of modern art collections, where the "physical act of carting pillaged beauty off to the homeland" transformed 

<b></b>

art into portable property.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The question of this "delicate military traffic problem," which entailed the literal displacement of art, trainload by trainload, quickly and literally bleeds into questions about the state of humanity itself in an atmosphere where people are constantly being displaced (<i>MM</i>, 220). The synthesis Flanner identifies, between the traffic of art and that of humans, suggests that humanity is at stake in the possession of objects. As Jews lost their property rights and national belonging, so too did art become "technically ownerless" (<i>MM</i>, 222). In her concern for Jewish property rights, and by extension, for the network of social relations created by the private ownership of art, Flanner suggests that some modicum of a private or personal relation to objects safeguards the value of both humans and objects.
</p>

<p>
Flanner's writing, which provides an idealized historical context for understanding the more abstract concerns about objects that influence the work of modernists such as Mary Butts, does not efface the significance of private possession, but rather transforms it as a stylized activity. The link Flanner observes between art's loss of ownership and the failure of human empathy represents the full culmination of a problem that Butts also understood, particularly in two overlapping ethical and aesthetic concerns that guide her work: England's connection with imperialist pillage, and the privatized exclusivity of intellectual privilege. Butts faults the intellectual circles that frequently excluded her with having circumscribed aesthetic space too tightly&#x02014;making it into a finely knitted web of privatized social relationships. Similarly, her prose tends to understand Britain's imperialist ethos in terms of space&#x02014;as wresting objects from the locations that might afford them more meaningful social and aesthetic relations. Texts such as Butts's 1928 novel <i>Armed with Madness</i> or her 1932 story "In Bloomsbury" underscore the relation that exists between imperialism and intellectual and cultural exclusivity. That is, Butts's work depicts what she sees as the genteel pretense of owning and managing culture and art as a direct outgrowth of imperialism's "grab and raid" mentality, and vice-versa.
</p>

<p>
As an alternative to this closed sense of culture, and as a means of creating a meaningful space for situating avant-garde politics, Butts frequently insists that art, or objects for that matter, require specialized physical and empirical placement as a sign of respect and as a means of promoting empathic relations. She persistently returns to the activity that creates both a peculiar category of ownerless objects and a failure of empathy&#x02014;pillage. For example, the plot of <i>Armed with Madness</i>, if one might call it that, follows a race to discover the questionable source of a jade cup, "a queer glass dish."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The narrative thus escalates through variously authored acts of inventing and describing the background of the cup, of placing or positioning it within historical space. Picus, the reported headmaster of this game, has supposedly stolen the cup from his acerbic father, a collector by trade. Intent on surrounding the cup with a mystical aura of ritual ceremony, Picus claims that the cup is an early church vessel, a Keltic altar-piece, which might "well have been part of a crusader's loot" . Other interpretations of the cup's origins abound: it may be the "poison-cup of a small rajah" in India , the Sanc-Grail, or nothing more than "an ash-tray in a Cairo club" . Ultimately, Butts suggests that the quest to authenticate such an item is a pointless one.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In demonstrating the futility of this search, Butts calls attention to the faulty logic of collecting that claims that the cup is inherently less valuable as a copy or replica than when it stirs the human imagination to envision it in differentiated forms. The text critiques the collector's logic of Picus's surly father, whose realist and dry cataloguing of the cup's origin as a "poison-cup" of a "small rajah" in India refuses to show respect for the more fantastic narratives of origin that Picus would dream up for it. Yet the narrative is correct in deeming the cup loot. And while Butts seemingly takes delight in divesting the cup of its sacred status, its protean amenability to numerous visual interpretations lends a nervous edge to her descriptions of the vessel. Firmly connected to no-one and nothing, the cup's detachment signifies a disease suffered both by itself and by the aesthetic community <i>Armed with Madness </i>invites its reader to examine. The characters' irreverent treatment of the cup, evident in its use as a prop in contests for power that consist of hiding it, stealing it from others, and consigning it to a life of immobility, divides their community. In one way or the other, the cup's status as loot, its placelessness, creates spacelessness&#x02014;an absence of community where the meaningful position of objects could be apprehended.

<p class="noIndent">
While <i>Armed with Madness</i> attempts to present an ideal aesthetic community that must vigilantly maintain itself against the forces that attempt to disrupt its self-placement, other examples of Butts's fiction mock aesthetic spaces that prove even harsher environments for a healthy object-life. Butts's story "In Bloomsbury"  savagely exposes the facile nature of <i>au currant</i> intellectualism by depicting a wealthy family whose "magnificent collection of jade" connects them to the British Museum.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The siblings certainly style themselves appropriately: one paints, one practices "elaborate dissipation," one has a "fashionable taste in sex," and all have received "admirable" educations. Likewise, they "talked the current psychology, dressed in the admired disorder of their world . . . had a true and just, if rather <i>faisande</i>, understanding of the arts" . Primarily, the narrative directs its derisive scorn at the family's inability, despite its status and education, to appropriately own the objects of its wealth. As affluent producers and consumers of culture, the family has not acquired the proper skills of ownership.
</p>

<p>
The Curtins are aptly named because their cordoning off or privatization of lived space disables a veritable object-life, despite all their efforts to appropriately acquire one. In the story, the name "Curtin" also functions as a pseudonym for the Bloomsbury intellectualism made famous by Virginia, Lytton, Clive, Leonard, et al. In contrast to the precarious balance between physical stasis and activity that structures the ideally lived space, the <i>dramatis personae </i>of both "Bloomsbury" and "In Bloomsbury" create a strict living environment that shrinks space, to invoke Merleau-Ponty, in a way that "leaves no margin" for determining the "physical and geometrical distance which stands" between the self and "all things" (<i>PP</i>, 186). In this specific setting, Butts appears to fault her much-resented contemporaries for arranging things both too strictly 

<b></b>

and too loosely. Such disregard for spatial management ultimately robs space of its meaning altogether. For Merleau-Ponty, space is only a reality when "the position of things becomes possible" (<i>PP</i>, 243). Space does not exist when things "float" aimlessly and without real attachment to a specified environment, or conversely, when their security is too bounded. "In Bloomsbury" accents the tense irony of a culture that values objects in their apparent detachment, yet fails to register how the ostentation of its spatial etiquette denies those objects proper placement.
</p>

<p>
This diffuse tale centers around the disturbance that transpires when the family's long-lost, racially ambiguous cousins come to visit, sparking the wildest nativist fantasies these London sophisticates can produce. The narrator, who appears as the Curtins' acquaintance, unites the siblings with their cousins while registering the irony of the Curtin museum connection and stellar collection of jade:
</p>

The narrator considers the <i>dur&#x000E9;e</i> of this beloved object, jade, and contemplates how the Curtins' obsession with their possession's legacy ironically cripples their roles as ethical owners of this beloved green substance. The truth is that the jade will outlast the Curtins and that their attempt to appropriate its organic immortality is also an attempt to block history. That is, the Curtins' belief in their sole ownership of the jade blindly shelters their own collection from the rape and pillage that has ultimately placed it in their hands. The narrator reads the jade as the quintessential representative of the ambiguities surrounding the modernist object. Jade is "secure" and jade is also "loot." By formulating this paradox at the heart of her critique of imperialism, Butts reveals her extreme fascination with the empirical substance of this material, perceptible both to touch and sight, and with its social status as a work of art. But rather than divorce the art work from its empirical status, Butts tends to see its subversive "objecthood" and its ability to solicit empathy as dependent on the very boundedness of its empirical structure. As a result, jade becomes loot in its ability to evade private ownership, even while the Curtins offer it the respect of their particular attachment. Ultimately, jade's transcendence lies in both its inorganic, or unloving nature, <i>and</i> in the social network through which it is exchanged and valued. 
</p>

<p>
As the quintessential modernist object, the particularly fortified yet vulnerable gem-like substance Butts features in her story solves one of the major modernist quandaries identified by Douglas Mao. As an object, the jade in Butts's story is able to fulfill its function of "intersubjective mediation" without sacrificing the value of the "thing itself or the realm of being."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  As loot, the jade exposes the hypocrisy of the Curtins' refinement and the frailty of the social space they attempt so delicately to cultivate. Because it evades ownership as a "thing itself," the jade's rootlessness disturbs the space the family purports to build around it. Its material security shrinks the social space that the 

<b></b>

Curtins have used it to build. The arrival of the South African cousins precipitates this spatial collapse, as they ratively reclaim the "loot" as their property. As the narrator records the irony of the wolfish cousins' entrance into the British museum, she wonders what it is they are going in to see: "What had they gone in to look at? They had entered like pirates who dare not swagger, who would loot if they could. Loot was their property and they would collect it. . . . Heartened by the thought of a smash and grab raid of the British Museum, I followed them inside" . By visually re-territorializing the loot as their property, the cousins expose the irony of how the Curtins and the museum have acquired their precious objects. The two men visually expand the strictly understood set of rules for placing oneself in the presence of important and sacred things. They redress the code of bodily conduct required of them during a formal visit to a museum and to the Curtins' Ashways estate, exposing how the set's particular style of ownership condemns their property to transient irresolution and aesthetic death.
</p>

<p>
The cousins dominate the Curtins' space because they understand their own status as objects. They present themselves as such, and the text appears both to mock the Curtins' empirically based but speculative judgments of their cousins, and suggest that the "two wolves" are an empirical reality. In keeping with scientific method, the Curtins had "decided to keep notes on anything we observed and report" . But it is the narrator who, by practicing a kind of seeing that "completed itself, image by image," as if "a cinema, an <i>actualit&#x000E9;</i>, infinitely prosaic," appears most interested in the cousins . The two men "lope in like powerful animals," and carry a landscape with them, a Yeatsian "desert with wild beasts" . The next "scene," which occurs on the "steps of the British Museum," is odd because the cousins panoramically carry their own situatedness in a manner that unmasks the fa&#x000E7;ade of the "scenes" of the museum. For the narrator, the primitive panoramic tableaux that occupy the museum both solidify and confuse the cousins' identities:
</p>

Down the narrow lit shaft of the Assyrian Room I saw them, looking at lions arrowpierced and stabbed. Their eyes were on the glance backwards. For what might be coming up behind? An animal or a man. One drew the attention of the other to points about lions. Neither was greatly interested.

<p class="noIndent">
The narrator's viewpoint centers the cousins both within and without the spectacle of the museum itself. Her own confused questioning of what the cousins would actually want to see in the museum occurs because she assumes the cousins are viewing replicas of their own brutish selves, enclosed in panoramic tableaux. Their feral presence completes or enlivens the museum by destabilizing its contents. On one level, their displacement occurs because they disturb the relations between spectator and spectacle. Accordingly, the irony of their visit to the museum lies in the sameness that exists between themselves and the stuffed beasts that occupy their gaze.  
</p>

<p>
But as evidenced by the lack of interest that each cousin ultimately shows for the Assyrian room, they never recognize their affiliation with the objects in the museum. The re-composed and re-structured bodies of dead animals do not elicit enough interest 

<b></b>

to achieve the status of objects. In terms of Worringer's construction of aesthetic modernism, the cousins invalidate the museum precisely because they do not empathize with any of its supposed objects. Since Worringer understands interested spectatorship as simultaneously self-affirming and self-alienating, the cousins appear to recognize no relation between their concepts of self and their observation. "To enjoy aesthetically," Worringer argues, "means to enjoy myself in a sensuous object diverse from myself, to empathise myself into it."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Apathetically lacking all interest or pleasure, they fail to project themselves into the scenes they observe.
</p>

<p>
This lack of empathy highlights the peculiar ways in which the powerful cousins, "with their tanned faces and great bones," function as objects while at the same time enlivening the story's critique of Bloomsbury. Within the museum, the cousins' disruption of the subject/object division that typically structures the relation between spectator and spectacle disparages how socio-aesthetic relations construct themselves around the apparently detached state of the object world. For Butts, true objects actually solicit interest. Thus, the cousins' disinterest in the Assyrian Room does more than simply disrupt the division between subject and object, spectator and spectacle. Their apathy condemns the museum exhibit, in its isolation, to the status of a non-object. As the narrator remarks, "inside were the mysterious treasures of the world, separate, almost sterilized but <i>there</i>" (43, emphasis in original). As long as these items remain displaced, uncannily "<i>there,</i>" separate from the social relations that produced them, they remain nothing more than loot. In its valuation of a specifically placed, empathic object, the story scrutinizes a culture that forms its social relations precisely by "seeing" objects that are socially detached.
</p>

<p>
Yet the detached, displaced "treasures" of the museum seem strangely well placed, as the narrator emphasizes, "<i>there</i>." In contrast, the cousins, whose bodies overpower the stylized space of the museum, appear monstrous within its manicured confines. The narrator's faintly erotic obsession with the corporeal aspects of the cousins' placement critiques the codes of spatial etiquette that governs a privileged life of aesthetic pleasure and consumption. The larger-than-life cousins overturn these rules of bodily and spatial conduct, as the question the narrator asks of them discloses her surprise at how their magnificent bodies could respond to a context so completely removed from them: "What had they gone in to look at?" . What could lure or exert its power over beings of this magnitude? In this frequent confusion, the narrator's obsessive cataloguing tends to focus on how actively the cousins move their bodies: they "lope in like powerful animals" , traveling "on the same stride that might side-step at any moment" , frequently "heavy in hand," like "visiting mountains in a delicate landscape, mountains that were even careful where they put their feet" . The cousins literally "impose their weight" on the Curtins' oversized egos, exposing the smirky inclusiveness of a shrunken space so delicate that it cannot withstand the intrusion of strangers.
</p>

<p>
The cousins' challenge to spatial etiquette directly involves their bodies. Butts's prose, abounding with attempts to sabotage the mores of the intellectual elite by aligning their aspirations with those of bourgeois culture, often fastens on the body to disrupt what she considers to be problem space. "In Bloomsbury" points to the problem of a 

<b></b>

spatial etiquette that is too strict, that reinforces only habit. According to the narrator of the story, habit orders an intellectual set in such a way that the sheer boredom it produces creates more dramatic expectations:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
No one had ever seen them enjoying themselves. . . . Not very long ago it was time for something to happen to them. In reality they had all been marking time, until something should happen in the world; something sufficiently vital&#x02014;that is to say, strange and oblique&#x02014;to catch their whole attention, exercise them, use them.

<p class="noIndent">
In keeping with Curtin hypocrisy, the siblings transform the stasis of habit into a performed action, which further excuses the inaction of literally "marking time." Although the Curtins do not seem to understand exactly what they're waiting for, the cryptic event occurs upon the arrival of their cousins, whose every movement, every facial feature, expresses a hard, almost crystalline sense of action. The cousins show "not a light" in their eyes but a "glint" . Even the reader remains unsure of the precise nature of this event, so that the Curtins actually appear to be expecting something more like a scene, or "atmosphere."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The cousins physically enable this development. In their fierce exactitude, they are a style, "fine brutes . . . dark, lean creatures," who carry no excess baggage or psychology to weigh down their imagistic immediacy" . The visual counterpart to Ezra Pound's imagism, they reveal a "sense of freedom from time limits and space limits," despite the precision of their demarcation.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Stripped bare, yet alarmingly steeled for invasion, the cousins erotically attract the Curtins', and the narrator's, attention. 
</p>

<p>
The primitive action of the cousins' bodies forces the Curtins into the submission that disrupts habit, and this is the event this family has really been awaiting. For example, Clarissa, the female of the group, muses over the effects of having an affair with one of them. But such an event, the text suggests, would have been too normal to produce the appropriate change to the Curtins' habitual regime. They require a more earth-shaking phenomenon, something that would physically change them, "exercise" their personalities beyond the limits of individual control . The Curtins await the arrival of an active object, which resists their efforts to "hunt" or objectify it, but which is in turn able to "exercise" them, to (quite literally) disrupt and rearrange the physical spaces of their bodies.

For Butts, narrative action depends on the rearrangement of the corporeal schema and of physical space more generally. Along with loot, Butts also links action, as exemplified in movement (be it carting, pillaging, or more positively, placing or loving), to her concern with the seriality of objects. In speaking of seriality, I do not simply refer to serially mass-produced objects, though Butts, like many modernists, was seriously concerned with the copy, and particularly the bad copy. Butts's obsessive interest in series of items appears to stem not only from her distrust of copies, but also from 

<b></b>

her interest in them. In attempting to move beyond individuality in character and occurrence, her work reaffirms seriality as it simultaneously disregards it.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  That is, Butts's fiction explores two related literary and aesthetic quandaries that characterized modernist theories of both detachment and empathy. The first concerns the difficulty of carefully nourishing an empathic life with soluble boundaries without sacrificing the value of the object's discrete and independent being. The second, metacritically broached by Butts's texts, in which objects constitute narrative itself, involves the challenge of constructing narrative around object-life. This problematic addresses the question of how a communicative and empathic object, lacking the boundaries that create individual security, provides the sticking points that maintain narrative development and organization.
</p>

<p>
In its placement of objects, Butts's story, "With and Without Buttons" foregrounds these issues in narrative development. Two sisters attempt to trick their cynical neighbor Trenchard by feigning the presence of a ghost in the old house they share with him. "With every door and every window open" to the world and to the earth, the house is "a female power asleep," waiting for the sisters to stimulate it into action.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The sisters' revenge against the dismissive cynicism Trenchard aims at their own, less conventional, belief systems, his "faith of disbelief as inaccurate as excess," consists in strategically "placing" the contents of a box of old gloves in Trenchard's part of the cottage, which is separated from theirs by a common wall . The sisters, who speak frequently from the mutual viewpoint of an impersonal "we," relate the success of their ploy to its apparent action and its ability to function as a series.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  When the narrator asks what the trick will be, the other sister answers that it does not matter:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Because before we begin we'll <i>do </i>something. Anything. A last year's leaf for a start, so long as it can go into a series&#x02014;on his blotter or his pillow. We're always in and out.

<p class="noIndent">
The sisters imagine the series as a specific placement of objects in the enactment of their "ill-doing" , as they will later describe it. This "doing," to which object-placement is central, will catalyze a series of events that will defy the sisters' original intention in placing the objects. The sisters also relate the series they build specifically to their narrative, or to their ability to produce a story and jointly author it through their "Signatures." That is, their placement of objects becomes a metaphor for narrative itself. The objects catalyze action, guiding the narrative's sequence and timing. The sequence and pacing of this plan is thus important to the sisters, who ascertain that their narrative will collapse if each occurrence in the series of events is exactly identical. Yet the particular force of their deception depends on how well they stage events that are similar enough to be called recurrences.  
</p>

<p>
The objects required to create these ghostly recurrences parallel the sisters themselves, who are slightly altered versions of each other. The gloves that provide the ruse of the tale are by no means artworks, but they copy themselves in such a way as 

<b></b>

to facilitate precision of placement as part of a serial action that organizes space. The content of these particular gloves is the same: "[a]ll one size  . . .  and for one pair of hands" . The exteriors of the gloves, however, supply the story's title: "With and Without Buttons," some gloves "have all the buttons and some have none and some have some" . Each glove is an inaccurate reflection of the next. They are not simply copies of each other, which would make them impossible to place, but designed slightly differently to enable the placement that builds narrative. Butts's narrative strategy maximizes placement as a code of action that energizes domestic life, bringing it into the collective, inter-dimensional and inter-subjective world, while simultaneously providing the kind of boundedness that meaningful space needs in order to exist.
</p>

<p>
To reiterate, I have argued thus far that space is meaningful and ultimately empathic when its structure preserves the forms of attachment that keep it intact. Space coheres when objects can clearly enunciate their locations, but not when these positions completely forbid movement. This kind of spatial resolve produces empathy. Meaningful space, as I have attempted to define it, tends to manage the full transfusion of boundaries that utter de-privatization&#x02014;or loss of exclusively attached object relations&#x02014;entails. For modernism, this particular version of space offers an ethical midpoint between an utterly detached "ironically anti-social subject position" and Wyndham Lewis's authoritative injunction that humans prosthetically replicate themselves in the external world. More generally, by synthesizing fixity and movement, this version of space presents a way of thinking about affective attachment that does not reify the object of attachment. Such attachments are symbiotic in nature, especially because objects mutually act on each other. For example, in "With and Without Buttons," the sisters are correct in viewing the privileged objects of their games as "stimulants" . As stimulants, they actually generate the appearance of other objects. For this reason, after the sisters "feed [Trenchard] a glove," they begin to realize that the "the gloves will feed themselves" . The observation is syntactically ambiguous. It both re-affirms the stereotypical role of women as caregivers and "feeders," distributors of empathy, while exposing the limits of those actions.
</p>

<p>
At the same time that they nourish and feed, the gloves compensate for a lack&#x02014;of sexual power. As the sisters point out, they could "have made [Trenchard] make love, to either or both of us, any day of the week" . Because they "wanted to have power over him, the power women sometimes want to have over men, the pure not erotic power, whose point is that it shall have nothing to do with sex," the sisters cannot accomplish their goal, which is to "suggest him into an experience," with only their bodies . Sex is plainly not an effective lure; what is required is a demonic attachment, a ghostly body that is at once a veritable body, and detached and strangely re-composed. In much of her work, including <i>Armed with Madness, </i>Butts suggests that women should move beyond their own bodies and sexuality to occupy a higher, more empathic and objective ground. The gloves of "With and Without Buttons" prove strange vessels for this type of empathy, particularly since the sisters are less than empathic in the ruse they devise for their captive, Trenchard. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
More accurately, the gloves that literally move Butts's story highlight the conceptual paradox inherent in modernism's conception of the object. However discretely placed, the gloves harbor an extremely diffuse, animate, and expansive power, that, detached from a veritable human hand, remains estranged from a unified self and ego. These items threaten a normative and gendered organization of space, as represented by the wall that separates the sisters' part of the cottage from Trenchard's. In particular, the gloves' strong odor breaks down this artificially erected boundary, working as a solvent that dissolves the tight security of Trenchard's "simple faith," which the text deems "pseudo"-rational and masculine . For Trenchard, the empirical reality of the gloves' smell, which reminds him of something he had smelled once "in Africa  . . . [b]ad skins," forms the most offensive aspect of their appearance . Trenchard repeatedly encounters the odor's potency, and desperately asks one of the sisters if she will retrieve the perfume she wears to mask it: "What's that lovely scent you wear?  . . .  I want to smell it. Get that" . But when the Parisian <i>parfum </i>appears, the stench triumphs&#x02014;the "sweetness, like a lady-like animal, of old kid gloves" . In terms of Trenchard's personal experience, the smell evokes the female body and Africa, what for him must be the most untidy, unhygienic female body of all, fiercely assaulting his European safety of immaculately pressed white linen shirts. While Trenchard's rejection of the gloves forms Butts's subtle critique of how English colonial ideology affects its valuation of the object, Trenchard's response to the smell also highlights his inability to empathize with the objects that surround him. Whereas the sisters' invasive control of the gloves suggests that they over-identify with these objects, Trenchard's willful alienation from them represents a gross detachment that drives him to his own insanity.
</p>

<p>
By focusing on the strange secretions of objects as forces that impinge upon the senses, Butts builds a modernism that emphasizes the permeability of both human and inanimate boundaries. In "With or Without Buttons," this movement across boundaries is depicted in the sisters' forceful attempt to alter Trenchard's acceptable range of imagoes and models for identification. However, the sisters do not fully understand their prank, which has taken on a life of its own that surpasses their intentions. The final blow delivered to Trenchard does not involve a glove, but a piece of "dark green cotton, dirty and torn," which literally attacks him, invading and staining his tongue and his mouth with its strange secretions . After the strange remnant is "dragged off" by the sisters, one is left to surmise that the unsightly fabric is actually a part of an old woman's undergarment, a petticoat. This petticoat, belonging to one dead Miss Blacken, had become a rather ubiquitous feature of village superstition, and the sisters use the story to fuel Trenchard's obsession. Significantly, the violation of space Trenchard experiences when this feminine delicacy wraps itself tightly around his head is not visual claustrophobia. "It was winding itself tight," he says. "But, oh God, it was the smell of it  . . . " . Trenchard responds to a shrinking of lived space where smell creates its own claustrophobia. In the special powers it holds over space, the tattered piece of fabric is elevated by Butts to the status of object <i>par excellence</i>. Not only is this object saturated with political and human meaning, its very objecthood represents a strange paradox for both the reader and the characters of "With and Without Buttons." It is 

<b></b>

important that both must work to identify the scrap of cloth as part of Miss Blacken's petticoat. The object is difficult to place but everything suggests that it is perfectly placed, with exceeding care, in its placelessness.

The power Butts confers on forgotten objects dignifies the unlovable or scrapped object, the Bachelardian refuse in the corner.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Throughout her work, Butts maps the distinction between the polish of the Parisian salon and the junkyard onto questions of gender and literary culture. Her critique of expatriate Paris is especially evident in <i>Armed with Madness</i>, for, according to the narrator's analogy, "If Paris is a lovely salon displayed for conversation, London is a lumber room to be foraged for junk, rubbish, white elephants, treasure" . Butts's irritation with the Parisian salon set coincides with Pound's, whose acidic poem denigrating salon life titles this section. Butts's embrace of the kitsch sensibility of junkiness she attributes to London "treasure" disparages Parisian salon culture as improperly owned and pretentiously "displayed," rather than ideally "placed."
</p>

<p>
Butts's 1932 story "From Alter to Chimney Piece" contains her most emblazoned attack on Parisian salon culture. According to Janet Lyon, the salon was "private" and "class-marked," a "pre-cursor to the public coffee house"; it "provided a forum for the enactment of ideal speech situations" at the same time that it "firmly controlled the directions speech might take."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In the case of Butts's story, the author's criticism targets not the "enactment of ideal speech situations," but the controlled enactment of "ideal" spatial situations. The text indicts what it sees as a modernist establishment based on inherited financial security and social prestige, whose unfeeling authoritarian control of both lived and literary space renders that space meaningless. The story, which Butts originally began as the "Gertrude Stein Song," describes Stein's salon and the webs of sociability it both supported and spawned (<i>MB:SL</i>, 304). A nexus for the various affiliations that characterized expatriate modernist culture, it attracted such renowned friends as Hemingway and Picasso, while demanding a fierce loyalty and reverence for its legendary proprietor.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The narrative itself follows a middle-aged English war-veteran whose obsession with a young American girl of questionable origin leads him to Stein, fictionally disguised as Miss Van Norden. Vincent, a bourgeois hanger-on with a lingering nostalgia for "high European life" follows his young American Cherry to Miss Van Norden's salon with some uneasiness, conscious that the girl will evaluate the success of his performance there in determining whether she will marry him.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  On one level, Vincent, like the other characters in the story, is the target of Butts's derisive pen. However, Butts privileges him through his ability to observe and reflect upon the 

<b></b>

odd formality of Miss Van Norden's "tea." After entering the salon, Vincent notices the visitors in "circulation" at an immaculately governed pace:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Exceedingly slowly they went, a flowing stream, turning their heads from left to right to look up at the celebrated collection of pictures, or down on to the tables, at books and manuscripts and <i>objets d'art</i>.

Butts's depiction of the room's tight order and self-conscious construction denies it the status of space. If Stein's salon, as Lyon has suggested, sought to cultivate "a collective visual aesthetic rooted in the act of scrutinizing [her] large collection of controversial anti-representational post-Impressionistic paintings," then Butts's story declares Stein's project a failure.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  According to Butts's critical eye, the seeing solicited by Stein's celebrated collection of pictures is ritualistic and rote, unimaginative and conditioned by socio-aesthetic training and tedious decorum. Butts describes an aesthetic code of behavior governed so strictly, a space so shrunken, that whatever action it creates is only valuable in its repetition. 
</p>

<p>
The passage at hand reminds one of <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> and Stein's claim that she tended to seat famous painters in front of their own paintings so as to force some kind of self-recognition. The paintings do produce self-recognition in the sense that they elicit social insularity and paranoia. The visitors' revolution around the tables yields only the sight of their counterparts' backs; Butts's criticism exposes the salon, ostensibly frequented as a room for looking, as it cultivates a paranoid fear of looking&#x02014;at other people. In stark contrast to the house in "With or Without Buttons," which opens itself to the world, this illustrious chamber possesses objects that do not perform their proper functions. Rather than expanding the self to encourage collective looking and empathic spectatorship in Worringer's sense, the items on display lack sufficiently critical recipients. Like the museum in "In Bloomsbury," the look elicited by these paintings does not free the self from its confines. In other words, Stein's salon forbids empathy. The room refuses attachment, and Vincent commits an egregious faux pas when he tries to speak to Cherry from <i>across</i> the long table, and even more shockingly, "when he anchored himself with a bun and more tea in a dim corner" as a stranger and an observer (252, 253). Considering the pride Stein took in her inventive seating patterns, Vincent's self-appointed action of seating himself violates the taboos that produce the anonymity and neatness of a void.

Conclusion: Object Lessons
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Because he indelicately locates himself as a point in space that others must notice and navigate around, even if he does only sit in the corner, Vincent's action is over-familiar, if not invasive. From the viewpoint of the salon set, he values himself as 

<b></b>

highly as the art objects that comprise the only other fixed points of attraction in the room. His perverse movement depreciates the value of the room, since seating oneself comprises one of the first steps in inhabiting it, or transforming it into lived space. In Butts's stories, this absence of lived space, characterized by a detachment that denies the objects on display any connection to the human world, evidences failures of both intimacy and empathy. Butts thus identifies the emptiness of a form of observation that is both affectively detached and disinterested. More specifically, she critiques an aesthetic decorum that attempts to separate the aesthetic realm from lived space, and which furthermore views this spatial etiquette as productive of some advanced degree of sociability. The assortment of hallowed paintings is placed too rigidly, and according to Butts, solidifies Stein's own great personality. It does not promote empathy, which results from an engaged form of perception that respectfully affirms the existence of the object and simultaneously places it. This understanding of empathy departs from many accounts in contemporary criticism and particularly queer theory which maintain that objects must be elusive or even "disappeared," must lack private grounding, in order to avoid their inevitable reification. In contrast, writers such as Butts emphasize the lessons that can be learned from the visible appearance and ethical ownership of objects.
</p>

<p>
Among these lessons is one about the inner lives of objects, which, like humans, possess interiors that they communicate through a phenomenological grounding <i>beside</i> each other. This sense of profile decenters the subject as the repository of a hidden psychology lodged within its secret recesses. Rather, empathy offers an opening into the external world that extends beyond individual psychology, subjectivity, and personality. As a result, Butts's work allows us to view a concept that has traditionally been claimed for humanism, such as empathy, from a post-humanist perspective. Whereas a humanist version of empathic exchange tends to see it as a transfer of subjectivity, Butts's literal profile of the object-world suggests that empathy is more a matter of surfaces&#x02014;"as pleasant as petal or silk" (not heart-wrenching or agonizing or self-involving).<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Empathy is not merely a matter of sentiment or psychological involvement, nor does it result from an attempt to possess or infiltrate the external world. Instead, Butts constantly negotiates the ethical and spatial distance that protects the integrity of the object without disregarding private possession altogether. As an alternative to the exclusivity of private ownership, her work advocates a mode of private possession where the relationships between subjects and objects are ultimately social, attached rather than detached, arising counter-intuitively through the precise placement of each object in relation to its surrounding world. This version of modernism both affiliates itself with and departs from the more masculinely inspired modernisms of Pound and Lewis. A more reflexive and ethically self-conscious version of Pound's imagism, Butts's modernism affirms the proximity of subject and object, dispelling identity in favor of a more soluble sense of self.

See Eve Sedgwick's list of a "few broad assumptions that shape the heuristic habits and positing procedures of theory today" in her <i>Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity</i> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2003), 93&#x02013;4. One such theoretical argument is exemplified by John Paul Ricco's <i>The Logic of the Lure</i> (Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, 2002)<i>,</i> a text which unites a queer theory that contests identity politics with the discipline of art history. As an attempt to offer an alternative to a theoretic practice that distinguishes too stringently between subject and object, this text explores the "middle grounds" of sociality, or "forms of sociability that do not require an object to either identify with or against in order to be viable" . Within Ricco's new "queer sex space theory," any form of phenomenological grounding ultimately acts as a device for the "circumscription or delimitation of space," inevitably reifying that object . As a response, Ricco advances the notion of a queer "disappeared aesthetics," which enforces the difficulty of determining "artifactuality, authorial presence, even form and content" (ibid). While I support Ricco's defense of a public sex culture of "passing intimacies" and "local encounters" against the communitarians who pathologize it, I wonder how the premised disappearance of the object acts less as an ethics of apprehending the object than as a dismissal of it.

I have modified Bowlby's statement slightly, which appears in her collection of essays on Virginia Woolf, <i>Feminist Destinations and Further Essays on Virginia Woolf</i> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997). In "Things," Bowlby claims that Woolf enumerates upon countless things&#x02014;aspects of interior d&#x000E9;cor, table settings, flowers, and fabrics, for example&#x02014;in novels such as <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and <i>Between the Acts</i> to suggest how the modernized world has lost "any fixed points of reference for personal and collective identity" . I would suggest that Woolf's fiction, and Butts's, for that matter, laments the loss of fixed points of affective attachment that dispel rather than solidify identity, a concept that neither writer demonstrates interest in affirming.

Butts compared herself explicitly to both Eliot and Lewis. While Eliot himself was not an admirer of Butts's writing, Butts professed in a 1927 journal entry that Eliot's work had been "before her," and, in a move typical of the self-aggrandizing alliances she frequently drew, stressed the similarity of their projects: "T. S. Eliot . . . the only writer of my quality, dislikes me and my work, I think. But what is interesting is that he is working on the Sanc-Grail, on its negative side, the Waste Land" (<i>MB:SL</i> 186).

For example, critics such as Daniel Tiffany argue that Pound often semantically inverts our general conceptions of subjectivity and objectivity, particularly as the terms relate to emotion and detachment, respectively. In <i>Radio Corpse: Imagism and the Cryptaesthetic of Ezra Pound</i> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1995), Tiffany suggests that the "'objective' image in particular raises interesting questions, since it emerges from a state of possession, an emotional seizure that Pound terms a 'vortex'" . Furthermore, Tiffany stresses that the 'objectivity' of the Image occurs not by purging emotion, but through the agency of emotion" . Following Tiffany's claim, I suggest that Pound's empirical relation to the image or the object incorporates the human, as opposed to blockading it.

This description appears in Butts's essay "Bloomsbury," edited by Nathalie Blondel and Camilla Bag and republished in  5:2 (April 1998), 32&#x02013;7. In her critique, Butts appears to draw from an often resentful hostility shared with other artists toward the set: "Say 'Bloomsbury' and then, on the Freud Game, only too often a string of words will follow, varying with the player: 'The intelligentsia in excelsis,' 'Oh, that lot,' 'those barren leaves,' N.BG. [No Bloody Good], '<i>faisandes,' </i>'awful warnings,' 'mental hermaphrodites,' 'brittle intellectuals,' '<i>that </i>bunch'" .

Mao identifies this conflict specifically in regard to Virginia Woolf and sees it as having been engendered by writing "which may outlive its author and evade the author's intentions yet seem to speak nonetheless . . . " (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 56). This writing makes it difficult to "live the belief that meaning resides only in relations between subjects, never within the thing itself or the realm of Being" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 56). I argue here that Butts's version of empathy synthesizes the difference between these two situations.

I follow Virginia Woolf in using the word "atmosphere." In her famous essay, "Street Haunting: A London Adventure," in <i>Collected Essays</i>, Vol IV (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1967), 155&#x02013;66,

Woolf uses the term to describe a phenomenological mood that the perceived object calls into being. This phenomenological ground is not always stable but is subject to various shifts. At this particular moment in the essay, Woolf describes a dwarf who enters a shoe store, accompanied by two women of "normal" proportions. By presenting the shopkeeper with her beautiful and "aristocratic" foot, the dwarf "changed the mood," having "called into being an atmosphere which, as we followed her out into the street, seemed actually to create the humped, the twisted, the deformed" .

See Pound's "A Few Don'ts By an Imagiste" in <i>Poetry</i> 1 (March 1913), 200&#x02013;6. Here, Pound explains that the image presents "an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time" . A "complex," Pound suggests, represents that freedom from "time limits and space limits" I mentioned.

However much Butts appears to render suspect the classical trappings of plot by confusing the reader and her characters about what "really" happens in the story, she does tend to create plot according to the model Peter Brooks identifies in <i>Reading for the Plot: Design and Intention in Narrative</i> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1984). Following Tzvetan Todorov, Brooks claims that plot "is constituted in the tension of two formal categories, difference and resemblance" . In Butts's story the serial appearance of the gloves creates the plot; their simultaneous similarity and difference organize the space of the story. As Brooks observes, this "same-but-different" narrative presents temporal form according to an "implicitly spatial" model .

While one sister in the story controls the narration, at the beginning it is not clear which one it is. In accordance with a style of narration that reduces the potency of the individualized "character," the pronouns "us" and "we" take center stage as the story unfolds: "It was trying to get out anyhow, but if he had not irritated us and made us want to show off, we would not have made ourselves serviceable to it. And it was we who came off lightly" . The "we" here, which reads as if the narrator literally suffers from multiple personality disorder, resembles a royal we whose power lies in the fact that it is not an "I." Indeed, as the story progresses, the sisters appear unable to operate independently. This confusion of identity functions as a means of enhancing their impersonal power, which develops through their de-individuation.

According to Shari Benstock's <i>Women of the Left Bank: Paris 1900&#x02013;1940</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986), Stein was "less restrictive" socially though equally "demanding of loyalty" as she had been before her career was established . Butts's "From Alter to Chimney-Piece" reflects this change, and is especially relevant to Benstock's claim that Stein was "particularly open to the young, to those whom she might influence, to those who could carry her cause to the younger generation" .
