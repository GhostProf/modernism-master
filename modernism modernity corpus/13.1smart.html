The catalogue to The Menil Collection, <i>The Menil Collection: A Selection from the Paleolithic to the Modern Era</i> <i>, </i>reproduces on its frontispiece Max Ernst's <i>Portrait of Dominique </i>[<a href="#1">re 1</a>], commissioned by John and Dominique de Menil in 1934. This was the painting they had left behind wrapped in brown paper on top of a closet when they left Paris during the war, not liking it sufficiently to ship it to their new home in Houston or to leave it in the care of friends. Indeed, before that, it had languished for more than a year at the frame shop since no one had cared to collect it and no delivery address had been left. It was not until the framer finally put the painting in his store window that a neighborhood priest recognized the image to be of Dominique and the portrait was claimed (de Menil 1964). Long since redeemed from its ignominy, the painting now forms the heart of what has become internationally one of the most significant collections of the work of Max Ernst, which itself forms a part of the 15,000-piece Menil Collection.
</p>

<p>
Acquired over a period of 45 or so years, The Menil Collection is the formerly private collection of Dominique and John de Menil [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], open to the public since 1987 in the form of a purpose-built museum, designed by Renzo Piano. Considered a very important collection of New York School painting and among the most significant Surrealist collections in the United States, its holdings include pieces from an array of cultural and historical traditions. They have an antiquities collection; a very well regarded collection of Byzantine icons; Oceanic and African art; colonial art from the New World; and the European moderns, including Matisse, Picasso, Braque, L&#x000E9;ger, Mir&#x000F3;, and

Klee. In 1995, it opened a freestanding gallery solely for the permanent exhibition of the work of Cy Twombly, and in 1997, construction was completed on a chapel built to house thirteenth-century frescoes (the dome and apse of a Cypriot church) that were bought and restored by the collection. Since November 1998, Richmond Hall, an adjacent building formerly used for storage and occasional temporary exhibits, has been opened to the public, housing three site-specific works by Dan Flavin&#x02014;which was to be Dominique de Menil's final commission.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Each of these initiatives furthers an intricate moral, political, religious, and aesthetic agenda to which Dominique and John de Menil had given early expression in their 1964 commissioning of the Rothko Chapel, the Philip Johnson-designed, non-denominational chapel named for Mark Rothko whose paintings were commissioned for it.

Ethnography of Aesthetics
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The narrative of the rejection and subsequent rehabilitation of <i>Portrait of Dominique</i> has become the story that is told repeatedly to conjure the extent to which the sensibilities of the de Menils were transformed.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  It is presented specifically as the story of Dominique and John de Menil's aesthetic conversion, but more broadly it offers an account of the redemptive character of art. 	As I will show, this idea of the efficacy of art, specifically in the rehabilitation of modern sensibility, is central to the project of The Menil Collection. The art object for Dominique de Menil is richly imbued, not merely a plastic form, nor just the conveyor of symbolic meaning. It is at once an embodiment of the artist's sensibility, a catalyst for certain modes of experience, and as such it may serve as an instrument of spiritual restoration (though conversely it may foster the kind of moral or spiritual degradation that she observed around her).
</p>

<p>
Alfred Gell, in his essay "The Technology of Enchantment," addresses the way in which art objects can participate in "securing the acquiescence of individuals in the network of intentionalities in which they are enmeshed" (1992: 43). Here he draws attention to art's agency. As Nicholas Thomas points out, Gell's project responds to the failure of the anthropology of art "to dissociate itself from projects of aesthetic appreciation that do for art what theology does for religion" (Thomas 2001: 2). This failure can be read overwhelmingly in the body of anthropological literature on indigenous art that takes the tone of connoisseurship. The familiar critical response to this kind of connoisseurship, of course, has been the sociological project of demystification, in which art is revealed as really a sign of something else&#x02014;most notably of distinction and of power. While attention to the ways in which art is called upon to serve the interests of power has offered important insights, this approach overlooks the specificity of art objects and, as Thomas and Gell both recognize, their particular efficacy. This has entailed a flattening of anthropology's analysis of art and of the institutional and social processes with which it is entwined. Current work in the anthropology of art has, as Fred Myers points out, begun to respond to this, to consider the particular work done by art objects "as <i>indices</i> of agency and effective in mediating social relationships" (Myers 2004: 204).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Gell's frustration with anthropology's projects of aesthetic appreciation has led him, however, to eschew attention to aesthetics altogether, as if to take it seriously would be to succumb to its mystifications. My own project shares Gell's insistence on recognizing art as an agent in social processes, but it sees the production of aesthetic domains and all the density of experience<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  that they afford as central to art's efficacy. At The Menil Collection, the aesthetic that has been so attentively crafted is intended to produce an affecting engagement between persons and objects that is charged with the compelling intimacy of possession. The larger ethnographic project from which my analysis here draws is not an ethnography of The Menil Collection as a place or of Dominique de Menil as a collector, but rather it is an ethnography of an aesthetic &#x02014;specifically, of the processes by which an aesthetic is created, materialized, and participates in broader domains of social practice. In what follows, I argue that the density of the relationship between persons and objects that possession affords is extended at The Menil Collection beyond the prerogatives of ownership to the museum's visitors, or at least that is the experience that the museum seeks to foster. Further, I argue that Dominique de Menil has wished to generate this kind of engagement with art in the interests not simply of asserting the collector's distinction but in the earnest pursuit of an alternative project of modernity, a "sacred modern."
</p>

<p>
Having left Paris in 1941, Dominique and John de Menil [<a href="#3">re 3</a>] took up residence in Houston, where John de Menil served initially as the head of Schlumberger operations in South America and the Middle East. He is widely held to have been a major force in the emergence of Schlumberger as one of the world's largest corporations in the 1970s, providing oil detection technology to drilling companies throughout the world, technology that had been developed by Dominique de Menil's father Conrad Schlumberger and uncle Marcel Schlumberger (Allaud and Martin 1977, and Auletta 1983a, 1983b).
</p>

<p>
The de Menils' collecting began only after their move to the United States, with John de Menil's 1945 return from a business trip to New York with a C&#x000E9;zanne watercolor, <i>Montagne</i> (ca. 1895). They proceeded to buy the work of L&#x000E9;ger, Rouault, Picasso, and Braque, only later being introduced to the Surrealist works for which the collection has perhaps become most distinguished. While their collection was acquired only after they had taken up residence in Houston, their early purchases were made in New York, in a New York art world recently transformed by the presence of a significant body of exiled French modern artists and dealers (Guilbaut 1983, Sawin 1995).
</p>

<p>
Dominique and John de Menil, by all accounts, found New York beguiling, appealing to their distaste for the stifling traditionalism of France or, rather, to their enthusiasm for progressivism.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  And certainly it must have presented itself as a welcome relief from the grim urgencies of wartime Europe.
</p>

<p>
Their initial interest in buying art was in response to their friendship with the French Dominican priest Marie-Alain Couturier [<a href="#4">re 4</a>], who found himself in North America at the outbreak of the war. He consequently stayed on for some five years, circulating among exiled artists and working on the intellectual refinement of his own project concerned with the spiritual restoration of French liturgical art, contributing centrally to what became known as the Sacred Art Movement.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
There are a number of people who have powerfully influenced Dominique de Menil's acquisitions and shaped their subsequent representations in the context of The Menil Collection. But the first, and surely the most foundational, was Couturier, whose aesthetic judgments were inevitably infused with moral adjudications. "The fervor of Couturier's words," Dominique de Menil observed, "borne by the gravity of what he had to say, transcends the ephemeral and touches us like the mark of the absolute" (de Menil 1989: 9). His judgments and their ideological underpinnings, then, informed not only the de Menils' strictly aesthetic preoccupations but also a much broader agenda of moral and political activism.
</p>

<p>
Unlike many collectors who characterize themselves as having always had a special appreciation for art, Dominique de Menil describes herself as having been awakened to it under the guidance of Couturier who, she has repeated in a variety of ways, "opened her eyes," and "taught her to see."
</p>

<p>
Couturier fostered not only Dominique de Menil's ability to "see" art but encouraged her to buy it also:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[H]e cured me completely of my puritanical block against collecting. He sort of made it a moral duty to buy good paintings. . . . I remember one summer [during a brief stay] in Paris, he was visiting us, and my mother was there. We had been offered a lovely Rouault and we were not going to buy it because the day before we had bought with Father Couturier a superb Japanese sculpture.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  So at least we hesitated and he said, "Well, you must buy it. If you can afford it, just buy it." I remember my mother interfering and saying, "But father, if they keep buying art they will have nothing to eat but crumbs." And then, completely undisturbed, he said, "Madame, let them eat crumbs and hang good paintings on their walls." So we bought the Rouault.

<p class="noIndent">
On their frequent business trips to New York, John and Dominique de Menil would accompany Couturier in tours around the New York dealers. Dominique de Menil was not immediately seduced by the work she was being shown and was anyway initially uncomfortable with the idea of spending significant sums of money on the purchase of art. Her reticence was short-lived, however, and she very soon joined her husband in actively acquiring works and continued to do so passionately for some fifteen years after her husband's death in 1974; "once you develop a taste, you only stop when you have to" (de Menil 1983: 37). The drive to accumulate expensive luxury objects may seem at odds with one who seeks spiritual restoration, but this identification of material acquisition with moral dissolution is a view more consonant with Dominique de Menil's Protestant upbringing than with her husband's Catholicism, to which she converted after their marriage. Her embrace of Catholicism was profound. She established a deep friendship with Jacques and Ra&#x000EF;ssa Maritain, she attended Yves Congar's lectures on ecumenicism and was deeply affected by them, and she was to develop a heartfelt longing for the reunification of the Church, a rapprochement between East and West.
</p>

<p>
It was, Dominique de Menil has commented, the austerity of her paternal Alsatian Protestant forebears that prevented her mother and grandmother from themselves buying paintings. "One did not indulge in what was considered 'luxury': no rare books, no 

<b></b>

antique furniture, nothing really expensive except perhaps some silver. Yes, one had to have silver but not paintings. Paintings were considered ostentatious" (de Menil 1983: 36). Dominique de Menil apparently did not share her father's puritanism: "Certainly I did not inherit a tradition of patronizing the arts, but I inherited the craving, the unfulfilled craving of my mother and grandmother" (de Menil 1983: 36); a craving articulated in her oft quoted comment, "What I admire I must possess" (quoted in Browning 1983: 141).

In dramatic contrast to the identificatory assertion that <i>Portrait of Dominique</i> constitutes as the frontispiece to the Collection catalogue but taking an equally prestigious position, on the page facing Dominique de Menil's Foreword, is a painting by Domenico Veneziano, <i>St. John in the Desert</i>, ca. 1445 [<a href="#5">re 5</a>]. It is not as a particular jewel of The Menil Collection that this work is reproduced in such a prominent position. It is not only not held by the Collection, but never will be. Once belonging to Bernard Berenson, it is now held in the Kress Collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In her Foreword, Dominique de Menil wrote this of the painting:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

A lonely adolescent is disrobing in the solitude of mountains; a gray landscape with brownish green bushes and a flash of dark ruby-red&#x02014;his cloak. I am so fond of this strange and miraculous little painting that I experience it as totally mine when I stand in front of it. And I think that in years ahead there will be those, unknown to me, who will take and "possess" works that I have acquired.

<p>
It is the strangeness of this choice of image that is the provocation for this paper. It seems at first glance a particularly brazen act of appropriation, or conversely, perhaps a strangely forthright marking of humility to draw attention to the limitations of her own collection. In any event, we read in the accompanying text of the collector's unabashed declaration of possessiveness which is ameliorated, in the next turn, by her sanguine recognition that objects in her own collection will be similarly subject to such impulses. Indeed, as we shall see, Dominique de Menil does not regard such possession as simply an unavoidable byproduct of others having access to the works in her collection, far from it. It is precisely this possessive relationship that she seeks to foster in those who engage with the collection. Without imagining this intimacy of possession, no matter how fantasized, the museum becomes a site of alienation where objects are paraded before us that can never be enlivened by the possibility of ownership. Dominique de Menil's reference to possession here speaks of the alchemy by which we might all become collectors, albeit vicariously, rather than merely passive consumers.
</p>

<p>
This notion of possession in the absence of ownership is taken up by the nineteenth- century essayist William Hazlitt when he characterizes the experience of possession as an impulse of envy and a process by which that envy is overcome in the recognition of the superior character of one's own engagement and appreciation. He offers by way of illustration an anecdotal account of the experience of "passing through a fine 

<b></b>

collection of pictures" as one of the "personal adoption" of the object of admiration, a practice that "always end[s] in a daring project of usurpation, and a determination to expel the actual proprietor, and supply his place so much more worthily with our own identity" (Hazlitt 1991: 193).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  While Hazlitt's somewhat snide characterization draws attention to the redemptive impulse even of this vicarious mode of possession, it also reveals in its ambition to displace the "actual proprietor" the disquieting aspect of this possessive relationship for the collector.</p>

<p>
What seems so surprising about Dominique de Menil's invitation to others to engage with works in her collection in a manner that is imbued with the intimacy of possession is that insofar as collectors experience a high degree of identification with their collections, one imagines that others "possessing" constituent works might be considered an affront, not only to the integrity of the collection but of the collector also. But, of course, possession for the collector enables not only the experience of engulfing intimacy but also the authority and control afforded by ownership. It is this compound notion of possession, Paul Holdengr&#x000E4;ber argues, to which Benjamin refers when he writes, "Possession is the altogether deepest relationship one can possibly have to things" (quoted in Holdegr&#x000E4;ber 1992: 96).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What I will argue is that while the Menil Collection should quite properly be understood as an instrument of the collector's project of self-fashioning, it is at the same time a very particular organization of a relationship between objects and subjects that can offer access to alternative projects of modernity.
</p>

<p>
The idea that there is a defining relationship between possession and personhood has been well established in the theorization of possessive individualism (MacPherson 1962) and has been further elaborated in discussions of collecting as an intensified form of this (Handler 1987, Clifford 1988). In this view, the collector's urge to possess is driven by a desire to materialize the self, whether as an expression of self, as a means to shore oneself up against loss, or as a technology of self-definition.
</p>

<p>
The collection is, as James Clifford notes, a "strategy for the deployment of the possessive self," an exercise in "making the world one's own, [gathering] things around oneself tastefully, appropriately" (Clifford 1988: 218). In this process the collector is not simply a consumer of objects but, as Susan Stewart notes, "generates a fantasy in which it becomes producer by arrangement and manipulation" (Stewart 1993: 158). While the ordering of objects within a pre-established series, the re-creation of a Victorian parlor, say, or the collection of seventeenth-century Italian paintings, suggests 

<b></b>

not so much production but the reproduction of a given form, the eclectic collection bears the sign of mastery:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Each sign is placed in relation to a chain of signifiers whose ultimate referent is not the interior of the room&#x02014;in itself an empty essence&#x02014;but the interior of the self.  
<p class="blockquote">
	In order to construct this narrative of interiority it is necessary to obliterate the object's context of origin. In these examples eclecticism rather than pure seriality is to be admired because, if for no other reason, it marks the heterogeneous organization of the self, a self capable of transcending the accidents and dispersions of historical reality.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The Menil Collection is such an object; a materialization of a heterogeneous self that allows a unified expression in the form of a signature, "the Menil aesthetic."
</p>

<p>
Donor-built museums, which open once private collections to the purview of the public, can, in this light, be understood as an extension of the collector's project of the self, wherein the content and style of the museum become part of a rhetoric of a distinctively constituted self. And, moreover, insofar as the museum bears the sign of permanence, it can be seen as a technology by which a transcendent self might compellingly be articulated.
</p>

<p>
While in donor-built museums it seems that the public is called upon merely to bear witness to the creation of the collector, the members of the museum's public in fact become drawn in as agents in the process of the collector's self authorship, as are the museum's trustees, its staff, media commentators, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the "multiple agents and agencies," to use Debbora Battaglia's phrase (1995: 8), involved in the self-fashioning of the collector who opens his or her collection to the public, the donor museum&#x02014;insofar as it appears to present the singular vision of the collector&#x02014;has the peculiar ability to convey a sense of the collector as a self marked by individuality and personal distinction.
</p>

<p>
This preoccupation with the self should, however, be set in relief, lest Dominique de Menil's exercises in self-fashioning appear as merely self-servingly subjectivist. In his characterization of the various formations of modern selfhood, Charles Taylor draws attention to a modality of self-formation that struggles with the flattening and distancing of the experience of modernity. This struggle, far from being simply therapeutic, is engaged in a more extended vision: "the search for moral sources <i>outside</i> the subject through languages which resonate <i>within</i> him or her, the grasping of an order which is inseparably indexed to a personal vision" (Taylor 1989: 510).
</p>

<p>
The de Menils and The Menil Collection itself have quite self-consciously participated in this struggle with the disenchantments of modernity. In seeking to create the conditions of possibility for a personal, resonant experience, they have sought to retrieve a moral engagement with the world that is governed neither by an "objective order" nor by a "procedural instrumentality," to use Taylor's terms. This kind of experience is conjured at The Menil Collection through the production of intimacy mediated by aesthetics.

Redemption
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The museum's galleries are constructed as more or less discrete domains that may be reached independently of each other from a central promenade [<a href="#6">re 6</a>]. The large galleries are themselves subdivided, some temporarily in response to the requirements of specific shows, others more or less permanently, to create more modestly proportioned rooms for some of the semi-permanent installations. What was sought in the interior arrangement of the galleries were intimate spaces, wherein a person might experience a visceral engagement, in which, as Dominique de Menil has expressed it, "one's territory is invaded by a work of art such that it demands a response" (de Menil 1968: 11). The intimate character of these spaces relies not only on their strictly architectural form, but also on a range of more ephemeral evocations [<a href="#7">re 7</a>]. Lighting is carefully attended to and there are no physical barriers between the artworks and the viewer, no lines drawn on the floor, and Plexiglas is used sparingly, and always with great regret. Works are hung considerably lower than at many museums, such that one meets them more or less at eye level. There are no didactic wall panels and labeling is spare; docents and audio guides are absent. And, moreover, there are no crowds.
</p>

<p>
In the architecture of the museum, through the installation of exhibitions, and throughout the organization and practice of the museum in, as I have elaborated elsewhere (Smart 1997, 2000, 2001), an economy of excessive care, The Menil Collection generates an aesthetic that seeks to rehabilitate the sensibilities of the viewer. The alienation that is expressed in the familiar attitude of silent veneration, might, in this construction, be overcome through the intimacy of possession.
</p>

<p>
In the context of The Menil Collection, then, art objects are engaged in a complex project of redemption operating across a range of registers. The notion of art playing a redemptive role is of course not new, but recognition of that role, in itself, does not offer much analytically. As Max Weber points out, "the meaning as well as the intended and actual psychological quality of redemption" has depended upon a systematic "image of the world . . . 'From what' and 'for what' one wished to be redeemed and, let us not forget, 'could be' redeemed, depended upon one's images of the world" (Weber 1958: 280).
</p>

<p>
This redemptive imperative can be understood in terms of Dominique de Menil's deep engagement with the French Sacred Art Movement and with Catholicism itself. Permeating her accounts of her spiritual and aesthetic commitments are expressions of longing, for experiences of immediacy in which sensibility takes precedence over reason, morality over instrumentality, and for the authority of the absolute. Indeed, what she desires, for herself and for others, is contact with moral sources taking a form not unlike the kind of epiphany that Taylor describes. Dominique de Menil was deeply invested in the idea that art, properly framed, could produce just this effect, and it is for this reason that she understood The Menil Collection to be engaged in a project of redemption, for herself, but crucially also for others, and for objects, too.

The Collector's Counter-Model
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Moreover, drawing on the work particularly of Walter Benjamin, collecting itself is revealed as an essentially redemptive impulse insofar as the collector's project is one of the salvage and liberation of objects. Contrary to the critiques of collecting that draw attention to the act of collecting as one in which objects are wrenched from their original circumstances and meanings and deprived of their use-value, Benjamin compellingly evokes the collector's counter-model, wherein the collection rescues and consecrates its constituent objects. Benjamin characterizes the redemption of objects as "perhaps the most hidden motive of one who collects" (Benjamin quoted in Holdengr&#x000E4;ber 1992: 112). Paul Holdengr&#x000E4;ber elaborates on Benjamin's insight here:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The great collector sets himself another Sisyphean task, the utopian and doomed duel with and against dispersion. This "struggle against dispersion," perhaps, one of many possible responses to a world in disarray, dispersed, whereby the collector is "moved" to take things in for repair, provide shelter, and thereby see himself as saving the destitute things of this world, cannot, he knows, last. It is the collector's hope that if he does not find immortality, his collection will, for things so patiently assembled should remain housed under the same roof.

When in "Unpacking My Library" Benjamin asserts, "to a book collector, you see, the true freedom of all books is somewhere on his shelves" (1982: 60), he sees objects liberated from such perfunctory relations of acquisition, re-enchanted through the engulfing intimacy of possession.
</p>

<p>
Didier Maleuvre makes a gesture toward historicizing the character of what he calls the "entanglement of subject and object found only in ownership" (Maleuvre 1999: 97).
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Bourgeois mentality in its early phase valued accumulation and ownership as the mark of social fulfillment. The early bourgeois subject saw the world in terms of possession and non-possession. It never occurs to Robinson Crusoe that the island on which he has just been stranded can be anything but his dominion. He relates to his objective environment first and foremost as an owner, thereby transforming it into an extension of himself as subject. That is why an attack on any part of the kingdom was construed as an attack on the king's body, that is, against the sacredness of the subject-object. By contrast, the owner in advanced capitalism is a mere plenipotentiary. From the president of a democratic nation to the private homeowner, the individual is just a <i>manager</i> of resources that, objectively defined, can be passed on to the next competent person. No longer to be eternally possessed

<p class="noIndent">
And of course this is precisely the circumstance of objects in most public collections. Indeed a possessive relation to the objects of the collection on the part of museum professionals or trustees is likely to be considered unseemly.
</p>

<p>
It is for this reason that Benjamin observes that while "public collections may be less objectionable socially and more useful academically than private collections," it is in private collections that "the objects get their due" (Benjamin 1982: 67). And surely Benjamin would include donor museums in this latter category, insofar as they assert the singular possessive vision of the collector and convey an air of the enduring permanence of that vision.
</p>

<p>
Whereas civic collections tend to be defined by their bequests and by the shifting agendas of their various directors, The Menil Collection has always conveyed the impression of a supervening identity&#x02014;if only articulable in terms of a certain singularity of vision. In this respect, as in others, The Menil Collection has been considerably more like a private collection than a public one. Historically, it has not been forced to accommodate the disparate interests of the trustees, who in civic collections must always be mollified lest they withdraw their support or dismiss the director, as so often happens. Right up until her death at the close of 1997, Dominique de Menil served as president of the Menil Foundation under which The Menil Collection operates and the board had largely been constituted by family members and personal associates of long standing who had a deep understanding of her project or were at least willing to defer to it. And while the Collection certainly has accepted gifts of works, most notably perhaps from artists and dealers with whom they have worked over the years, as well as from others with personal associations with the de Menil family, it had felt no obligation to accept gifts that it considered inappropriate or undesirable. Moreover, donors offered pieces fully cognizant, it would seem, of the extent to which their contribution would be subsumed by the "Menil vision;" gifts were seldom acknowledged on Menil labeling and the names of major donors to the museum were discretely inscribed in stone in Michael Heizer's <i>Charmstone </i> [<a href="#8">re 8</a>] that is installed outside of the building, consistent with what Walter Hopps, The Menil Collection's inaugural director, described as its policy of not naming donors within the museum itself.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  With the opening of the building in 1987, the transformation from a private to a public collection was officially complete, though in 1993, Paul Winkler, the museum's director, described it with evident satisfaction as still having "the identity of a private collection" (quoted in Kalil 1993: 24).
</p>

<p>
Now, some eight years since the death of the founder, the composition of the board has changed considerably, the now institutionally persuasive planning and development department has altered the terrain of benefactions, and since Paul Winkler's resignation as director and board member in 1999, there has been a less resolute position taken in response to potential donors. Thus far, however, this shift has been modest in its apparent effects. And certainly attention to the endowment and recognition of the need to encourage donors is by no means a new phenomenon for The Menil Collection.

Permanence
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In her later life, indeed right up until her death in her ninetieth year, Dominique de Menil became increasingly concerned with formalizing the management structures of The Menil Collection, bureaucratizing and depersonalizing what had hitherto been a resolutely 'familial' mode of organization. And while she had historically occupied the role of patron rather than recipient, she became now anxious to ensure the adequacy of the museum's endowment. The Menil Collection found itself, under the urging of the development specialist hired in the midst of this anxiety, having to demonstrate to potential donors its fiscal responsibility, read through the trope of efficiency. This imperative, however, runs counter to the excessive economy of care that has contributed significantly to the poetics of The Menil Collection. The scrupulous attention to presentation, the prestigious but expensive guest speakers, and the value placed on the meticulous, yet slow, realization of ambitious projects all became luxuries that could no longer be sustained, despite these characteristics being cited over and over as integral to the Menil aesthetic. </p>

What was taking precedence here over the character of the institution itself was, of course, another aspect of permanence that is concerned with the mortality of the collector. Insofar as the collection can be understood as a technology by which a coherent and enduring self might be constituted, it also gives material form to its inevitably contingent character&#x02014;it raises the specter of dispersion. The collection is a means 

<b></b>

of self-definition and stabilization, offering the prize of transcendence, while it is at once also an object of deep anxiety. In order to ameliorate this anxiety, the collector looks to securing the integrity of the collection. In this sense, Holdengr&#x000E4;ber notes, "The collector's struggle against dispersion" is not concerned solely with the redemption of objects, but is also, and perhaps centrally, "a struggle against time where the collecting subject seeks to attain through the collection 'victory over transcendence'" (Holdengr&#x000E4;ber 1992: 127).
</p>

<p>
This paradoxical character of the collection, simultaneously promising unity just as it threatens dissolution, lays the ground for a further contradiction with which The Menil Collection continues to struggle. In order to secure its long-term disposition, and thereby to secure the transcendent self of the collector, it is pressed to submit to precisely the imperatives of modernity that it has sought to overcome.
</p>

<p>
Certainly the most striking example of this was the hitherto unimaginable laying off of seventeen people just three weeks before Christmas in 1994. Among those whose positions were terminated were security guards and administrative and professional staff. Many had been working for Dominique de Menil for many years, at the Rice Museum, or for the Menil Foundation out of its offices in the various spare bedrooms and converted garages at the de Menil residence. Some had formerly worked for Schlumberger. The personal impact for those who found themselves without work was of course devastating, but it seemed all the worse to them and to those who remained because it had never been anticipated. Indeed, such a rationalization was "unthinkable." Menil operations had never employed such a model. It is true, however, that people had, over recent years, felt a change in the institution, recognition of which was typically expressed in the form of nostalgic narratives of a more energetic and integrated organization. But the lay-offs definitively drew an end to any identification with what had warmly been described as the familial organization of the institution.
</p>

<p>
The lay-offs were announced just weeks after the appointment of Dominique de Menil's goddaughter Susan Barnes to a new position as Chief Operating Officer of the Menil Foundation. Although her role was subject to a good deal of speculation, it became clear that her primary task was to secure the long-term disposition of The Menil Collection through increasing its endowment and rationalizing its practices in order to reduce operating costs. In this endeavor she joined Julie Gibbs, a development specialist hired just months before in conjunction with the 1994 launching of an endowment drive. Their task was an unenviable one, since they had been called, on the one hand, to overcome the widely held perception of wealth that had worked against a perception of need while, on the other hand, refraining from disrupting the appearance of permanence. Certainly, their internal rationalizations inevitably ran counter to much that had characterized The Menil Collection.
</p>

<p>
But despite the quiet advance of various forms of rationalization at The Menil Collection its intimate artifice had remained remarkably intact right up until Dominique de Menil's death. Indeed it has prevailed beyond that, but anxiety mounts for those who are invested in its resilience.

Self Possession
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
We have seen the collector here employing the museum to further, among other things, her project of self-fashioning, crafting the appearance of an enduring and singular vision, and in so doing producing the impression of the collector as an autonomous agent producing the conditions for her own transcendence. While self-fashioning may take the appearance of an expression of autonomy, Stephen Greenblatt, however, in his study of Renaissance practices of self-fashioning, showed that "fashioning oneself and being fashioned by cultural institutions . . . were inseparably intertwined." Indeed, every moment of "apparently autonomous self-fashioning" turned out to be "not an epiphany of identity freely chosen but a cultural artifact" (1980: 256). This insight is, of course, now a commonplace. I reiterate it here not to draw attention to the extent to which selves are "cultural artifacts" but to address instead the crafting of the appearance of the self's autonomy. The donor museum, particularly in the exemplary form of The Menil Collection, I have claimed, has the peculiar ability to convey a sense of the collector as a self marked by individuality and personal distinction. And at The Menil Collection the particular character of this distinction confers a kind of moral authority that furthers the redemptive project of the collection.
</p>

<p>
That the prerogatives of wealth that are so deeply imbedded in the identity and practices of The Menil Collection rest upon oil money, that from the outset the museum has been the recipient of considerable financial support from other foundations,<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  and that Dominique de Menil's aesthetic authority is underwritten by a deference to her French aristocratic origins, are always underplayed in the narratives of the Collection. Instead, what are repeatedly foregrounded are Dominique de Menil's preoccupation with spirituality; the moral worthiness of her modesty; her finely calibrated aesthetic sensibilities; and her humanitarian commitments. Each of these registers of eminence is taken up as a sign of her distinction and thereby as an expression of autonomy. They have long been established through press coverage of Dominique de Menil's activities, but they have their most authoritative articulation in the form of her various public projects. Houston was a city in which she and her husband could make a difference. They shepherded its burgeoning interest in modern art, lent their financial and social capital to the civil rights movement, and did much to fashion Houston's cultural institutions. Indeed, they extended their curatorial practices to the city itself. Together these commitments established a remarkably coherent expression of a unified self. But it is not only a unified self that was made possible but a remarkably unassailable one. In each of the domains of eminence I have identified and throughout the philosophical underpinnings of Dominique de Menil's projects is a sustained obscuring of the social structures of difference and a notable marking of personal distinction.
</p>

<p>
What is at stake here in the artifice of the autonomous self achieved through possession is, as Greenblatt points out, the desire, or rather, "the overwhelming need" to sustain the illusion that one is the principal maker of one's own identity (Greenblatt 1980: 257). But of course this is a distinctively modern impulse, insofar as it expresses a commitment to the freedom of the self. Throughout Dominique de Menil's commentaries on her self and her projects is a pervasive marking of personal distinction, 

<b></b>

rendered as a kind of cosmopolitanism,<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  in lieu of recognition of structures of difference and privilege. And this effacement of difference is expressed at the heart of her project, in seeking remedy for the disenchantments of modernity through recourse to sensibility, rather than through the more conventionally political project of the reform of social structure. Crucially, moreover, this distinction is asserted as a mark of one's freedom. In the modern world, Alain Touraine argues, "the criterion of the good is the individual's ability to control his or her actions and situation, to see and experience modes of behavior as components in a personal life history, to see himself or herself as an actor. <i>The Subject is an individual's will to act and to be recognized as an actor</i>" (Touraine 1995: 207).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The moral project of The Menil Collection and of Dominique de Menil herself, however, extends well beyond the modern injunction to exercise self-agency that Touraine identifies. While, as I have argued, The Menil Collection serves as an exemplary instance of the donor museum's ability to convey a sense of the collector as a self marked by individuality and personal distinction, in the case of The Menil Collection this self-fashioning participates in a more expansive moral vision. Seeking to enable access to what Taylor characterizes as the impulse to find "moral sources outside of the self," The Menil Collection binds the sacred with the modern in its attempt to create the conditions for redemption.
</p>

<p>
What is to become of The Menil Collection in the absence of the collector? As long as Dominique de Menil was alive, the artifice of intimacy was maintained not only within the museum's public spaces, but it permeated "behind-the-scenes" activities also and imbued the sensibilities of the staff. As the years have passed since Dominique de Menil's death, there has been considerable attrition of museum staff at all levels. As a consequence, the culture of the museum has shifted, with more recently hired personnel adopting a more strictly professional relationship to the collection. They have become its stewards rather than its owners. And as Maleuvre notes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
With the decline of ownership comes also an increased alienation between subject and object. Something that may account for the aloofness of art in the modern museum is the fact that it does not belong to anyone. . . . No doubt the emancipation of art from ownership means that art can begin to stand on its own, its artistic integrity no longer overshadowed by the collector's prestige. That art is not to be "had" agrees with the emancipatory thrust of art. On the other hand, the separation of art from ownership contributed to the autonomization of art and the frigid division of subject and object. Today the subject no longer has a place in the space of art, except one that is strongly marked by exteriority. Looking at art has become synonymous with being an intruder in the realm of art.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">

</div>

<p>
As I have argued, it is this alienation that The Menil Collection has sought to overcome in the interest of furthering Dominique de Menil's project of redemption. And the Collection endeavored to achieve this through the creation of the intimate artifice of possession. But this raised the question of whether this effect could be sustained now that Dominique de Menil is no longer alive and the operation of the museum has 

<b></b>

come to be understood more in terms of "stewardship" of the collection rather than "ownership," along with its concomitant formalization of relationships. And indeed, we saw signs of this toward the end of Dominique de Menil's life in response to the financial pressures that she faced in her attempt to secure the ongoing integrity of the project. As the collector anticipates a time when she will no longer be able to hold her collection together either conceptually or financially, her priority is to formalize legal and financial arrangements that will ensure the persistence of the collection in the future. Dominique de Menil was unequivocal on this matter. The Menil signature may find itself attenuated but sooner that than its erasure.
</p>

<p>
But, in truth, The Menil Collection has struggled with this since its inauguration. In the transformation of the private collection into a public museum, The Menil Collection has found itself subject to the imperatives of rationalization, to the very forces of modernity to which it has sought to serve as a counter-model. To manage a large, high-status public collection requires attention, if not adherence, to codified procedures, professional specialization, the formalization of human relations, and the strictures of efficiency and accountancy. Insofar as this contradiction was recognized, it overwhelmingly provoked a redoubling of efforts to mitigate its effect, to ensure that the seamlessness of The Menil Collection's intimate artifice was sustained. To the extent that it has succumbed to managerial stewardship, there will be no such effort to overcome its alienating effects.
</p>

<p>
This may be the fate of all donor museums that find themselves in the sway of managerial stewardship, as Maleuvre's argument suggests, but my intent here is not to articulate regret. Rather, it is to examine the manner in which a possessive relationship between persons and objects imbues those relationships with a deeply affecting density in the context of which, to reiterate Gell's characterization, the agency of art objects is intensified . But rather than following Gell in eschewing attention to the operation of aesthetics in this process, I argue that at The Menil Collection it is through the crafting of its seamless aesthetic of intimacy that a possessive relationship is quite intentionally fostered. Attention to aesthetic processes is, therefore, central to this analysis and suggests the possibility of a museum that is not "a lesson in compliance to authority and conformity" (Maleuvre 1999: 4), but which seeks to engage its public in a manner that has alternative ethical and political entailments.

That their critique of modernity was pursued in concert with their progressivist enthusiasms distinguishes their project from the kind of nostalgic anti-modern tendencies that Luk&#x000E1;cs  described as "romantic anti-capitalism." While the de Menils, like Lukacs' romantic anti-capitalists, regret the loss of the personal and immediate character of communal social organization, they do not long nostalgically for a return to pre-modern society. Rather, they imagine modernism itself as a means of rehabilitating the modern.

This project was developed around the design of the churches of Assy and Audincourt, and of the chapels of Ronchamp and Vence, and in his negotiation of highly controversial commissions for artworks for these sanctuaries from leading modernist artists, among them Matisse, L&#x000E9;ger, Rouault, and Le Corbusier.

Hazlitt goes further to argue that possession is to be desired in preference to mere ownership insofar as ownership confines one to a limited array of objects, whereas possession carries no such limitation.
