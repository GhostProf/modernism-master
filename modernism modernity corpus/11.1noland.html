<p>
Georges Bataille's <i>Lascaux, ou la naissance de l'art</i> (Lascaux,
or the Birth of Art) is a commissioned work.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
And, like all commissioned works, <i>Lascaux</i> bears the scars
of compromise. To a reader well-versed in Bataille's major works of
the 1930s, however, the large-format, lushly illustrated volume of
1955 appears almost lacerated, a patchwork of textual summaries (of
Johan Huizinga's <i>Homo Ludens</i> and Roger Caillois's <i>L'Homme
et le sacr&#x000E9;</i>, for instance) roughly stitched together at the
seams. Bataille seems to have set himself the ambitious task of fitting
all the pieces together, reconciling a generation of speculations on
Paleolithic image-making with his own already well-developed theories
on the implication of art in religious action. Many of Bataille's most
faithful readers have found his study of "prehistoric art" disappointing,
signaling a "retrenchment" rather than an advance.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
In Jay Caplan's words, Bataille's arguments in <i>Lascaux</i> are all
too "familiar,"
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
while for Michel Surya the work as a whole is "of less interest" than
the contemporaneous <i>La souverainet&#x000E9;</i>  or <i>Ma
m&#x000E8;re</i> .
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
In contrast, I will argue here that <i>Lascaux</i> is indeed a significant
book, not only in its own right but also as a precursor to contemporary
archaeology's most seminal meditations on images and signs. Bataille
is the first in a line of post-structuralist thinkers to exhibit a
fascination with the origins and the social dynamics of mark-marking
in general. That fascination is allowed greater scope in <i>Lascaux</i>
than elsewhere because the scientific discourse the French refer to as
"la pr&#x000E9;histoire" is the sphere in which questions concerning the
social function of mark-making,


<b></b>


mark-making's relation to art, art's relation to magic ritual, and
ritual's constitutive relation to "the human," can all be raised
in a scholarly and even forensic context. <i>Lascaux</i> is more
provocative than it first appears not because it overtly attacks or
transgresses disciplinary conventions, but rather because it engages
with an academic discourse in a way that is unprecedented in Bataille's
career and that therefore throws into high relief the hermeneutic value
of the interdisciplinary encounter. In <i>Lascaux,</i> Bataille is less
concerned with miming (to perverse effect) social science's methodology
and epistemology than he is with mining its resources.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
For the field of prehistory offered salient challenges to the dominant
Western conception of "art," fueling Bataille's larger goal of rethinking
aesthetic behavior within broad social contexts. Bataille's attitude
toward the academic discipline of prehistory&#x02014;a concoction of
archaeology, history of religion, ethnography, physical anthropology,
and art history&#x02014;is therefore not antagonistic when compared,
for instance, to the attitude he assumes toward the social sciences
in the early essays of <i>Documents</i>. And this is so not only
because <i>Lascaux</i> is intended for "le grand public" but, more
importantly, because the interdisciplinary field of prehistory forges
connections between different spheres of human behavior (such as art,
sacred ritual, mimesis, and trance) that confirm rather than contest
the primary impulses informing Bataille's own project.
<p>
Further, as opposed to <i>L'&#x000C9;rotisme,</i> which makes use
of some of the same materials, the Lascaux book anchors Bataille's
conceptual apparatus&#x02014;patchwork as it is&#x02014;in a specific viewing
experience. Bataille <i>looks</i> at the walls of the cave and this act of
vision does not support "a coherent interpretation" of discrete res,
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
but instead leaves him bewildered before a confusing tableau of tangled
and superimposed lines, a mass of indecipherable images leading
him to the very limits of vision understood as the discrimination
of forms in a bounded space. When he publishes <i>L'Erotisme</i> in
1957, he recalls only the most clearly defined depiction found in the
Lascaux cave, a stick re of a man beside a speared bison known by
prehistorians as the "Scene in the Shaft" (or "la Sc&#x000E8;ne du puits")
(<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Again in 1959 Bataille returns to this
depiction in <i>Les Larmes d'Eros</i> (The Tears of Eros), reiterating
an interpretation of the re that had by then been placed in question
but which fit with the theory of art as transgression that Bataille
was still pursuing.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<i>Lascaux</i>&#x02014;along with the preliminary drafts&#x02014;provides
the only record we have of Bataille's firsthand, eyewitness account of
the cave. The dominant impression it records is not one of conceptual
mastery over the decipherable depictions but of vertiginous confusion
before the "jumble" (<i>embrouillimini</i>) of superimposed res
(<i>L,</i> 55). Repeatedly, Bataille finds himself at a loss before the
"tangled [<i>enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;e</i>] and often almost illegible
engravings" (<i>L,</i> 47), the "heavy red bovines . . . which
encroach upon [<i>qui empi&#x000E8;tent sur</i>] the hooves and the
breasts of the bulls" (<i>L,</i> 59), and scenes in which one animal
is "covered over" by another, indecipherable re (<i>L,</i> 47)
(<a href="#2"> 2</a>). Curiously, however, the phenomenon of
superimposition as it is treated in <i>Lascaux</i> goes unnoticed by
critics of Bataille's work.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Yet superimposition, as an index of aesthetic intention, is at the
center of Bataille's reflections in <i>Lascaux</i> (and at the center
of many contemporary treatments of Paleolithic imagery as well). The
"Scene in the Shaft," which has preoccupied a large number


<b></b>


of Bataille scholars, is actually not the depiction at Lascaux that
Bataille's eyes find most compelling. And in the end, it is his eyes,
located in a viewing body, that reveal to him the aspect of Paleolithic
image-making most crucial to the affirmation of a more innovative theory
of art and its origins, one that links image-making to the rhythmic
repetition of inscriptive gestures.<br />

<p>
Critics such as Steven Ungar, Suzanne Guerlac, and Lars Iyer have in
part misconstrued Bataille's project in <i>Lascaux</i> because they have
read it exclusively through the lens of Bataille's <i>philosophical</i>
preoccupations, and, more specifically, only insofar as


<b></b>


these preoccupations can be situated within a Heideggerian aesthetic
tradition extended in the direction of Blanchot.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
When Bataille is seen to depart from a strictly Heideggerian tradition,
as in Denis Hollier's or Rosalind Krauss's readings, he is presumed
to do so only in order to replace the model of art's origins in
Greek architecture with a transgressive model of art's "primitive"
origins in graffiti-like defacements on the walls of French and
Spanish caves. Unfortunately, these critics have not sought to situate
Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> within the lesser-known context of archaeology,
anthropology, and the history of religion, the very disciplines with
which Bataille, in 1955, would have been in dialogue. Such a lacuna
deprives <i>Lascaux</i> of one of its most important insights (one that,
not incidentally, animates contemporary research in paleography as well):
that the origin of artistic behavior may lie not in the desire to depict
nor to alter, but rather in the urge to <i>move</i>, to displace the
body rhythmically, to model and expend kinetic energy choreographically,
and to leave traces of this choreography for a purpose that one may
choose to call "spiritual," "expressive," or "social," but which does
not necessarily, as Bataille discovers, manifest an urge to deface.
<p>
In short, previous critics have followed Bataille's itinerary
through European aesthetic philosophy or Durkheimian anthropology,
but they have neglected to trace his course through the scholarship on
Paleolithic image-making itself. I want to differentiate my own reading of
<i>Lascaux</i> from that of former critics precisely along these lines,
asking the questions, "How might Bataille be said to intervene in the
discipline of prehistory?" and "What effects might this intervention have
had on the development of Bataille's own understanding of art?" Reading
Bataille with the prehistorians, I will situate Bataille's argument,
methodology, and insights in relation to the disciplines specifically
concerned with ancient visual culture. My premise is that we will discover
more about the significance of Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> if we approach
it as grounded in and continuing the work of Paleolithic archaeology as
it investigates the cognitive and expressive conditions of possibility
for human mark-making on durable supports.

</blockquote>

<p>
The field the French invented at the beginning of the nineteenth
century known as "la pr&#x000E9;histoire" was, during the 1950s, one
that permitted a great freedom of speculation. Because so little was
known about cultures existing more than thirty thousand years ago,
the so-called prehistorians were obliged to integrate a large dose of
metaphysics into their empirical methodology. It is therefore misleading
to assume, as does Ungar, that Bataille, any more than his contemporary
prehistorians, was "motivated . . . by a fascination that removes his
inquiry from any claims to practical knowledge."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
On the contrary, among prehistorians, the search for "practical
knowledge" was very often propelled, for better or for worse, by a type
of fascination that bears a strong resemblance to that exhibited by
Bataille. Many renowned prehistorians, such as the Abb&#x000E9; Henri
Breuil (to take only the most famous example) were in fact priests,
a class of investigators that can hardly be considered immune to
metaphysical speculation. As Margaret Conkey has noted, "priests were
motivated to be among the first discoverers,


<b></b>


to perhaps 'control' the discoveries," which concerned, after all,
for them, the "origins of religion."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
A close reading of the pertinent literature demonstrates that Bataille
models his own approach in <i>Lascaux</i> on that typically assumed
by the priest-cum-archaeologist (an approach refined to perfection
by Breuil). To a large extent, he faithfully follows the narrative
conventions of archaeological accounts and combines in similar ways a
vast array of tools: empirical data provided by ethnography, conceptual
frames drawn from philosophy and psychology, scenarios suggested by
physical anthropology, and, last but not least, perceptual routines
prescribed by archaeology and art history.
<p>
On the second page of <i>Lascaux</i>'s preface, Bataille provides an
indication of what his relationship to the discipline of prehistory will
be. "I have limited myself," he states, "to taking up the archaeological
givens [<i>les donn&#x000E9;es arch&#x000E9;ologiques</i>] such as they
have been established by the prehistorians" (<i>L,</i> 10). Despite
this disclaimer, however, in <i>Lascaux</i> Bataille is <i>not</i>
simply "taking up," without modification, the "donn&#x000E9;es
arch&#x000E9;ologiques" such as they have been established by the
prehistorians. First of all, the "donn&#x000E9;es arch&#x000E9;ologiques"
are themselves often self-contradictory, and the prehistorians are by
no means united in their understanding of what these "donn&#x000E9;es"
imply. Second, Bataille himself engages in a careful and nuanced
reexamination of these "donn&#x000E9;es," evaluating them not only with
reference to his preformed aesthetics, but also against what he sees
on the cave walls. Bataille does not remain enclosed within either his
own philosophical constructions on the one hand, or the speculations
of the prehistorians on the other. His aesthetic meditations take on a
certain weight because he tests them against acts of perception that,
I shall argue, involve both his optical organs and the body in which
they are housed. In other words, as opposed to a critic like Blanchot,
Bataille doesn't use the caves as a point of departure for Heideggerian
fantasizing; he actually visits them.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
He observes, notebook in hand (see <a href="#3"> 3</a>),
and this experiential relation adds freshness to a perspective that
could easily have become congealed. Bataille's somatic experience of
the cave&#x02014;the fact that he not only examines the cave's surfaces
but also places his body between them&#x02014;gives him a knowledge he
would not otherwise have. It is this personal experience of the caves,
a sensual, somatic knowledge of them&#x02014;and not an unmediated
application of his favorite philosophemes&#x02014;that allows Bataille
to produce an original account of Lascaux, one that, as we shall see,
preres contemporary theories of ancient visual culture that encourage
us to see cave inscriptions not as "art," but as a type of ritualized
behavior, a set of gestures accompanying trance.
<p>
Originally published as <i>La Peinture pr&#x000E9;historique. Lascaux,
ou la naissance de l'art,</i> Bataille's book opens with a flurry of
introductory materials that frame the account of Paleolithic culture
he will provide. First, an anonymous blurb on the jacket provides
the major facts concerning the Lascaux cave: where it is located (in
P&#x000E9;rigord); how old it is (between fifteen and twenty thousand years
old); and when it was found and by whom (in 1940 by four adolescent boys).
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
After a title page there appears a short text by the editor of the
series, Albert Skira, who informs the reader that the volume contains
the first photographic record in color of the caves. Skira sounds a
note that will be

<br /><br />
echoed later in Bataille's text: the necessity of seeing the images
in person. The experience of visiting the caves is one that cannot
be replaced, Skira notes, even by the highest quality photographic
reproductions. "What the eye sees is not necessarily what the camera
registers," Skira laments. "Time and time again we thought that our
work was finished. However, as soon as the photographs were developed,
we decided to take new shots! . . . It has to be said: the paintings at
Lascaux are moving [<i>mouvantes:</i> unstable, undulating]" (<i>L,</i>
421).
<p>
According to Skira, then, even the best photographs of the Lascaux cave
fail to capture the "moving" quality of its images. Skira's choice of
the word <i>mouvantes</i> is appropriate, for throughout Bataille's text,
the word will reappear both in the nominative form (<i>mouvement</i>) and
the adjectival form (<i>mouvement&#x000E9;</i>). Skira's (and Bataille's)
use of the adjective <i>mouvantes</i> suggests not so much that the images
"move" the viewer in the rative sense (the appropriate French word
for indicating that the images elicit an emotional response would be
<i>&#x000E9;mouvantes</i>). Rather, <i>mouvantes</i> implies that the
images themselves are moving; they are subject, as Bataille tells us
later, to a "vaste mouvement" (<i>L,</i> 51). And this effect of mobility,
of instability, is due in large part to the relation of the images to
their support, that is, to the sloping, dome-like, but uneven surfaces
of the cave. Skira wants to impress upon the reader that the full effect
of the images depends upon them being seen <i>sur place.</i> In this
way, even before Bataille begins, the cave images have been sharply
differentiated from paintings executed on an easel, not only because
paintings can be more faithfully reproduced by photography, but also
because the peculiar nature of the cave images undermines the possibility
of a comprehensive gaze, one that could master all elements of depiction
and stabilize them securely within a perspectival grid. Looking at Lascaux
produces a kind of vertigo, Skira is suggesting, and this vertigo is part
of the viewing experience itself. "The images do not present themselves
as flat surfaces which one could see perfectly by positioning oneself
before them, two or three meters away," Skira explains to his readers;
"The artists of the grotto have made prodigious use of the relief and
the roughness of the walls, as well as the perspective of the halls. . . at each step, everything changes . . . What is the ideal point of
view? Each visitor must have his own, and the men of Lascaux had theirs,
which we have tried to comprehend" (<i>L,</i> 421). Despite the efforts
of his team, Skira concludes, the images will suffer from being reduced
to photographic reproductions. They might retain their perfection as
forms, but they necessarily lose their sense of movement and constant
vacillation before the eye.
<p>
Whereas Skira begins by emphasizing the specificity of the Lascaux images,
Bataille, curiously, opens his own account by attempting to assimilate
the cave's depictions into the "history of art and more generally. . . into the history of humanity" (<i>L,</i> 9). Bataille clearly
feels the need to establish a continuity between what he calls "l'homme
de Lascaux" (Lascaux man) and the modern viewer, and thus between the
cave images&#x02014;as strange as they might at first appear&#x02014;and Art
(with a capital A) as it is conceived within the European tradition.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
It is for this reason that Bataille breaks the mold of paleographic
scholarship and starts not by providing a detailed description of the
cave (as do Henri Breuil and Fernand Windels, two of the most prestigious
prehistorians of


<b></b>


his period), but instead by summarizing the works of "les
sp&#x000E9;cialistes" that identify the emergence of artistic behavior
with the birth of the human species itself.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Lascaux "communicates" with the modern viewer, Bataille claims, because
it transmits a "message" in a visual language we, as members of the same
species as Lascaux man, can understand (<i>L,</i> 12). In an effort to
establish the continuity of this visual language, Bataille considers
carefully the extant scholarship on prehistoric image-making before
turning in the latter chapters to his own viewing experience of the
caves. In the course of <i>Lascaux</i>, Bataille introduces forensic
evidence provided by paleontologists and physical anthropologists (Daniel
Peyrony, William Howells); he weighs the merit of competing theories
advanced by ethnographers and historians of religion (Saloman Reinach,
Kurt Lindner, Evelyne Lot-Falck); and he ponders the explanations
of image-making offered by various psychologists and philosophers
(Georges-Henri Luquet, Johan Huizinga). Ultimately, however, the approach
Bataille forges is guided by a profound perceptual experience of the
caves, one which is without doubt mediated by preconditioned responses
but nonetheless capable of providing him access to a variety of insight
that lends <i>Lascaux</i> its proleptic quality.
<p>
Although Bataille develops his own individual approach to Lascaux, his
account can by no means be considered immune to the kinds of prejudices
and fallacious assumptions that circulated in the archaeological
and ethnographic sources he employs. For the sake of his argument,
Bataille makes use of a broad spectrum of scholarship, much of which
would be considered by today's professionals in the field to be outdated
empirically and of dubious value heuristically. The very title of the
Lascaux book echoes one of the period's major (but false) preconceptions
that, as Breuil puts it in his famous <i>Quatre cents si&#x000E8;cles
d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i> (Four Hundred Centuries of Cave Art), the
paintings and engravings in the caves of the Pyrenees constitute the
"Origin of Art."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Bataille needs the emergence of modern man to coincide with the
birth of art not only in order to explain the power of Paleolithic
imagery to communicate across millennia, but also, and perhaps even
more importantly, to support his major thesis: that image-making is a
form of transgression, a sign, therefore, of the presence of the very
prohibitions that make humans human. Relying heavily on the authority
of the physical anthropologists, Bataille sets forth his argument
that "l'homme de Lascaux" represents "the achievement of the species"
(<i>L,</i> 20): "The name of Lascaux is the symbol of the period that
witnessed the passage from the human beast [<i>la b&#x000EA;te humaine</i>]
to the subtle beings [<i>l'&#x000EA;tre d&#x000E9;li&#x000E9;</i>] that we
are" (<i>L,</i> 22).
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
There is thus no doubt that Bataille's text is marred&#x02014;and
limited&#x02014;by the Eurocentrism and primitivism of the humanist
project. But while Bataille employs the mid-century archaeological
narrative of human evolution (as well as the ethnographer's account of the
"contemporary savage") in order to establish the birth date of something
he can call "art," he nonetheless refuses to accord credibility to the
account of art's <i>meaning</i> that the social scientists of the time
were advancing. Prehistorians during Bataille's period were limited
by the paucity of their tools (and of the evidence) to imagining
scenarios in which the depictions might have been produced. Many of
these scenarios were based not on the specific contents of the imagery
(which differed from


<b></b>


site to site), but on broad hypotheses derived from the study of
indigenous peoples still living in tribal conditions. It is important
to recall that Bataille wrote <i>Lascaux</i> approximately ten years
before Andr&#x000E9; Leroi-Gourhan began publishing his ground-breaking
structuralist studies of cave imagery, studies that would usher in a
dramatically different manner of interpreting the visual culture of the
Paleolithic by focusing on the internal relations among images rather
than on their hypothesized cultic or ritual functions.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Habits of viewing that would be developed by the structuralists of
the 1960s were, during the early part of the century, in an embryonic
state; in contrast, theories of the image's social and religious
functions had reached a high degree of elaboration. In order to
establish these functions&#x02014;since they could not be read in the
imagery itself&#x02014;prehistorians before Leroi-Gourhan had to borrow
heavily from comparative ethnography, a field that blossomed at the
turn of the century with the advent of Emile Durkheim's <i>Les Formes
&#x000E9;l&#x000E9;mentaires de la vie religieuse</i> , based on
the massive synthesizing studies of James Frazer, Edward Burnett Taylor,
and John Lubbock.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Evidence drawn from the observation of Native Americans and New
Zealanders, Australian Aruntas and African Bushmen was mobilized to
account for the location and content of cave imagery executed hundreds of
thousands of years earlier. The explanatory model that would have been
most influential upon Bataille when he visited the cave of Lascaux in
1952 was therefore one that insisted upon the necessity of understanding
the motivations of Paleolithic image-makers through the lens provided
by ethnographic research on indigenous groups referred to at the time as
"contemporary savages."
<p>
Until the discovery of Lascaux, research on Paleolithic image-making was
still very much under the sway of an ethnographic doctrine that emphasized
the utilitarian function of representation, its imbrication in rituals of
sympathetic magic. Basing their conclusions on the findings of research
conducted in areas remote to Europe, prehistorians such as Reinach,
Count Henri B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n, and, in their wake, Breuil, argued that
Paleolithic image-makers also engaged in aesthetic behaviors primarily
(if not exclusively) because they believed mimetic representation could
ensure the abundance and capture of animal prey. The impulse toward
image-making and mark-making in general was thought to be secondary to a
biological imperative; examining prehistoric images as works of art in
their own right would therefore have been considered to be misguided,
privileging an aspect of mark-making that "primitives" themselves
considered negligible. As Reinach, the comparative ethnographer and
historian of religion, wrote in his immensely influential "L'Art et
la magie" of 1903, for those living in hunter-gatherer societies,
"producing images was about assuring, by means of magic practices,
the multiplication of game, upon which depended the existence of the
clan or the tribe . . . the image of a being or of an object lent power
over this object or being; the author or possessor of an image could
<i>influence</i> the thing represented."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
The only conclusion that could be drawn concerning images found in
such caves as Altamira, it seemed to Reinach, was the conclusion he
had drawn about cave images produced by aboriginals in Australia:
they had been executed not in order to please, but in order to "evoke"
(<i>&#x000E9;voquer</i>) or conjure forth during a ritual of "hunting
magic": "Calling such


<b></b>


images works of art, in the modern sense of the term, is an anachronism;
the prehistoric sculptor was not trying to please<i>,</i> but to
conjure . . . the great flourishing of art during the Reindeer Age
[<i>l'&#x000C2;ge du renne</i>] is linked to the development of magic,
such as it is practiced in tribal societies of hunters and fishermen
today" ("AM," 135-6). Or, as B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n would put it, "once
man recognized the evocative and creative powers [of the image], magic
became the support, the essential foundation of art."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
It began to emerge during the next generation, however, that forensic
evidence (animal bones found in hearths) flatly contradicted Reinach's
theory: the species of animals depicted on the caves were not those that
the Aurignacians most frequently consumed. As early as 1931, Luquet noted
the presence of animals and scenes that had nothing to do with the hunt,
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
and a few years later, Max Rapha&#x000EB;l insisted that the depictions of
noncomestible animals were so numerous that an alternative explanation,
based on the singular attributes and contents of each individual site,
must be sought.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
In short, if it could be proven that aboriginals in Australia were
practicing sympathetic magic to attract prey, such a claim could not
be sustained in the context of prehistoric man. But this was only one
of the problems presented by a hasty recourse to ethnographic research
conducted in spatially and temporally alien fields. A greater problem
with the comparatist approach, critics would soon argue, is that it
drew attention away from the actual marks on the wall, discouraging
analysis of their individual properties and environmental contexts in
favor of large overarching theories of social function based on groups
that had no direct relation to hunter-gatherers of the Aurignacian
times or Cantabrian spaces. However, since, as Reinach himself noted,
there were no equally persuasive models available during the 1930s,
the comparatist account remained dominant (and still, despite the
intervention of structuralism, holds a strong grip on the field today).
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Additional support came from developments in French ethnography, which
was flourishing during the third decade of the twentieth century.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Predictably, then, the German ethnographer, Kurt Lindner, found an
eager French audience when he published his comparative ethnographic
study, <i>Die Jagd der Vorzeit,</i> in 1937 (translated as <i>La Chasse
pr&#x000E9;historique</i> [The prehistoric hunt] in 1941). In effect,
Lindner's work propelled the next wave of comparative ethnography
and helped shape the approach against which Bataille would argue in
<i>Lascaux</i>. Lindner followed in the footsteps of historians of
religion such as Reinach, arguing in even more forceful terms that
cave imagery was fundamentally instrumental in nature, dictated by the
exigencies of magic rituals that corresponded to the belief systems of
hunter-gatherer tribes. A true comparatist, Lindner based his theory
on the hunting practices of living Caribou Eskimos, insisting that, for
both contemporary and prehistoric "savages," a belief in the depiction's
power to be magically "possessed" by the spirit of the animal preceded
any interest in the depiction's aesthetic value.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
For Lindner, aesthetic considerations would have been almost entirely
absent in the production of images forged primarily to ensure the
survival of the tribe.
<p>
When Bataille moved from the Coll&#x000E8;ge de Sociologie to
archaeological sites in the Dordogne, this is the background of
scholarship he inherited. Given his audacious attempts in the 1930s to
rethink art through culture, it is significant that Bataille was


<b></b>


not more willing to absorb the ethnographic teachings of Reinach and
Lindner.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Their attempt to view the cave images within larger (albeit invented)
cultural contexts could conceivably have appealed to Bataille's own
concerns. Yet clearly, in <i>Lascaux</i> Bataille's greatest energy
is spent refuting the comparatist contention that in Paleolithic
image-making aesthetic considerations were subordinate to utilitarian
ones. Repellent to Bataille is the implication that art, at its
origin, is linked primarily to the <i>practical</i> economies of
survival, that it is in profound harmony, rather than provocative
tension, with the instrumental and profane world of labor. As
opposed to the ethnographers, Bataille strives in <i>Lascaux</i>
to remove representation from the category of survival economies and
culturally consolidating prohibitions in order to place it squarely
in the domain of expenditure and transgression. Bataille's strategy
is to resurrect and emphasize the aesthetic qualities of the Lascaux
cave images as these qualities strike the modern viewer. He does so,
on the one hand, by depending upon the work of two modern viewers,
Breuil and Windels, and, on the other, by trusting his own considerable
talents as an observer of the images themselves. If Bataille insists
in <i>Lascaux</i> upon the modernity of the cave's images, on their
ability to communicate their "message" over hundreds of thousands of
centuries <i>to us,</i> it is in order to disentangle this imagery
from its immediate function, from the uses to which, according to
ethnographers, it had been put (and by which its effects would logically
have been limited). Responding directly to Lindner's contention that
the entire value of image-making for prehistoric peoples resided in
the notion, attributed to sympathetic magic, that by making an image
of an animal one could control it, Bataille writes in <i>Lascaux</i>
that no "particular practical intention" can explain the existence of
art (<i>L,</i> 42). "Doubtless, we must acknowledge the existence of
a specific, practical intention [<i>une intention &#x000E9;troitement
mat&#x000E9;rielle</i>]," Bataille concedes; "In the minds of the men
of Lascaux, magic must have played a role similar to that which it
plays in peoples studied by ancient history and ethnography. It is
nevertheless worth protesting against the tendency to attribute too much
meaning to this desire for immediate effect [<i>cette volont&#x000E9;
d'action efficace</i>]," he qualifies. Admitting that a mark might be
made in order to serve a particular, localized purpose, Bataille goes
on to stress that "in every ritual operation the attempt to produce a
certain result, to fulfill a certain purpose, is only one among many
of the intentions of those involved: these intentions embrace reality
in its entirety&#x02014;religious reality, the reality of the senses,
aesthetic reality." For Bataille, the ultimate goal of image-making
is "the creation of a sensuous reality [<i>une r&#x000E9;alit&#x000E9;
sensible</i>] which modifies the world, responding to our desire
for something miraculous, extra-worldly [<i>une r&#x000E9;ponse au
d&#x000E9;sir de prodige</i>], implied in the very essence of what it
is to be human" (<i>L,</i> 37).
<p>
In this passage, Bataille rejects with some vehemence the utilitarian
model of image-making and proffers instead his own aesthetic theory or
rationale for Paleolithic representation. The "efficacy" model does not
account for a central objective of image-making, states Bataille, which
is to "modify the world" in such a way that it respond to our "desire for
the miraculous." It is unclear whether Bataille means that this desire,
essential to our humanity, is something that differentiates us from the
animals or, alternatively, brings us closer to them. It would seem that
it is both at once, for the


<b></b>


aesthetic impulse is the very sign that we want to recapture something
we, as humans who make the world into a world of things, have lost: the
<i>animal</i> sense of the world as not yet divided between subjective
consciousness and reified object, a world, in other words, that remains
profoundly sensual, penetrated by and penetrating our existence as
unbounded beings. As Bataille writes further on, the objectification
of the world made possible by man's naming of things "tears" man away
from an immediate sensual experience of them (<i>la sensibilit&#x000E9;
imm&#x000E9;diate</i>); but through art man can regain this sensual
immediacy and rediscover, on a visceral level, his continuity with
the world around him: "Man rediscovers sensation [<i>le sensible</i>]
if, by means of his labor, he creates, over and beyond useful works
[<i>des oeuvres utiles</i>], a work of art [<i>une oeuvre d'art</i>]"
(<i>L,</i> 30).
<p>
By associating the cave images with the retrieval of a sensual (animal,
immediate) relation to the world, Bataille manages to attack historians
of religion such as Reinach and Lindner on two fronts. First, his
emphasis on the sensual as opposed to the functional qualities of
the images themselves (the way in which they address needs that are
more than biological in nature) reverses the hierarchy established
by the prehistorians; Bataille subordinates utilitarian concerns
to aesthetic&#x02014;or <i>aisthetic</i>&#x02014;ones, and makes magic
(and belief systems in general) secondary to the ecstasy of creative
praxis, the unprofitable expenditure of energy. This is Bataille's way
of accounting for "the beauty that fascinates the visitor to Lascaux"
(<i>L,</i> 15): the fact that we still resonate to the images is proof,
for Bataille, that their (ritual) function does not exhaust their
communicative force.
<p>
Second, Bataille's approach to cave images contradicts the comparatist's
urge to forge analogies between Paleolithic man and other tribal peoples
living in distinct climes and temporalities. By insisting that cave images
are "oeuvres d'art," Bataille distances them further from ethnographic
scenarios and draws them into closer relation with what he considers to
be the most sophisticated artworks of European civilization. However,
Bataille's move to extricate the cave images from utilitarian scenarios
is facilitated by the evidence of Lascaux itself, which struck all who
saw it as containing forms of pictorial expression far in advance of any
that had been seen before. Reinach and Lindner were writing, after all,
before the discovery of Lascaux in 1940; had they confronted Lascaux's
more "polished" depictions, its scenes of rushing herds and grazing
couples that resemble in their <i>facture</i> and handling the iconic
traditions of Western illusionism, they might have found the comparative
gesture less convincing. On the other hand, Bataille pays a certain price
for refusing the comparatist gesture, for displacing the ethnographic
frame in favor of an implicitly acontextual, art-for-art's-sake kind of
approach. In his attempt to wrestle the images of Lascaux out of the
hands of "les sp&#x000E9;cialistes," MM. Reinach and Lindner, Bataille
ends up relating image-making itself, at its very origins, to "the
highest aspirations" of man:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
These are works of art [<i>oeuvres d'art</i>] like any other, and
they are no less beautiful [<i>belles</i>] than any other. . . . all
civilizations have had the same fundamental reason for constructing them
[<i>la m&#x000EA;me raison profonde de les &#x000E9;difier</i>], the basic
desire common to all men, of


<b></b>


whatever period or region, to be amazed
[<i>&#x000E9;merveill&#x000E9;</i>]. If we seize this aspect of things,
we can say without pause that, despite his extreme poverty, Lascaux
man was animated by the highest aspirations [<i>des aspirations les
plus&#x000E9;lev&#x000E9;es</i>].
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
"Belles," "&#x000E9;difier," "&#x000E9;lev&#x000E9;es"&#x02014;these terms
cannot but startle a reader familiar with Bataille's earlier essays on,
for instance, the "informe." Here, Bataille is practically forced by
the momentum of his argument to identify Lascaux with his b&#x000EA;te
noire, "Architecture," that monumental form of human productivity that
represents for him&#x02014;at least in 1929&#x02014;everything elevated
and orderly. Indeed, the portrait he gives us in <i>Lascaux</i> of the
"oeuvre d'art" as motivated by "the highest aspirations" seems the very
opposite of a practice of mark-making dedicated to retrieving the sensual
ambiguities and transgressive possibilities of "la sensibilit&#x000E9;
imm&#x000E9;diate."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
It is not surprising that readers enamored of Bataille's earlier writings
on art would be somewhat chagrined by this turn of events. But it is
worth pausing for a moment to ask how and why Bataille arrives at such
a curious point, for in reality he is navigating a precarious passage
through opposing but equally treacherous systems of explanation, each
of which exerted considerable force on the commissioned writer at the
time. Since these systems and their discursive conventions might not be
immediately available to readers unfamiliar with the history of research
on Paleolithic visual culture, I will briefly attempt to chart them here.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"<i>cet enchev&#x000EA;trement d'innombrables graffites . . ."</i>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
During the period prior to the discovery of Lascaux, and thus before
Bataille even began contemplating the Lascaux project, the discipline of
prehistory had been undergoing a rather dramatic transformation. While
still following the trail indicated by Reinach, paleographers were
increasingly applying methodologies to the study of cave images derived
not from the discipline of comparative ethnography but rather from
those of art history and archaeology. Even the terms for designating
the object of study had changed. For instance, after the authenticity
of the Altamira cave paintings was confirmed by &#x000C9;mile Cartailhac
in his famous "mea culpa" of 1902, images that had originally entered
the discourse of the social sciences under the heading <i>graffites</i>
suddenly came under the purview of art history as well as paleontology and
began appearing under a new guise&#x02014;as <i>dessins,</i> for instance,
and then as <i>peintures,gravures,</i> and, finally, <i>oeuvres d'art</i>.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
To be sure, accounts such as Reinach's still played a dominant role
in studies devoted to cave depictions; however, the sheer quantity
and variety of examples that were unearthed between the end of the
nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth produced
important alterations of the "art as functional" thesis.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Two voices were particularly resonant during the early twentieth century,
those of Breuil and Luquet, both of whom were well known to Bataille
by the time he offered Skira his book on <i>Lascaux</i>. As might be
predicted, these authors would have a profound influence on the way
in which Bataille approaches the question of why prehistoric man made
images in the caves.


<b></b>


<p>
Breuil's intervention in the domain of prehistory has had perhaps the
longest-lasting impact on the development of the disciplines concerned
with the Paleolithic. An ordained priest as well as a professor of
prehistoric ethnography at the Institut de Pal&#x000E9;ontologie Humaine
de Paris, Breuil studied Paleolithic cultural production in China, South
Africa, and Europe. He was present at the discovery of several major caves
in the Dordogne (Les Combarelles I and Font-de-Gaume [1901]), helped
excavate La Mouthe  and Trois-Fr&#x000E8;res , and, having
gained wide renown by 1940, was the first professional archaeologist
invited to visit Lascaux&#x02014;nine days after it was brought to light.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
Breuil never entirely abandoned the comparatist approach, and therefore
always assumed a continuity between the practices of contemporary
cave painters in Australia, his favored analogue, and those of
hunter-gatherers inhabiting the Dordogne hundreds of thousands of
years before.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
However, he offered the field a new orientation when he introduced a
strict system of classification that focused attention on aspects of
the images earlier ethnographers had ignored. Noticing incompatibilities
in execution among different types of images sharing the same support,
and conjecturing that these incompatibilities resulted from the use of
tools and techniques that varied over the course of history, Breuil
developed a chronology that separated the cave images into discrete
epochs or phases and emphasized the progressive refinement of depictive
techniques over time. According to Breuil, not only did the cave walls
provide a palimpsest of technically distinct depictions, but these
technical distinctions remained constant within a certain period. In
short, it could be said that each age possessed its own "style": "it
suffices to observe with care this constant order," suggested Breuil
as early as 1906, "to establish at once the relative chronology of the
diverse artistic phases that succeeded one another during the entire
duration of the Reindeer Age."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
In a sense, Breuil's "relative chronology" was responsible for ushering
"prehistory" into the domain of history <i>tout court</i>. Breuil
gave temporal thickness to prehistoric time. Further, his notion of
"diverse artistic phases" or successive "styles" allowed "prehistoric"
cave imagery to be assimilated into the same epistemology of chronological
classification that dominated art historical approaches of the period.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Breuil buttressed his tacit identification of Paleolithic epochs with
modern epochs by applying to the description of Paleolithic imagery a
descriptive vocabulary and a cyclical model of rise and decline drawn
from art historical discourse. (For instance, the "Upper Paleolithic"
was, for Breuil, the apex of cave image-making just as the High
Renaissance art of Leonardo and Michelangelo was, for Vasari, the
culmination of the Western tradition.) This cross-fertilization of the
two disciplines, comparative ethnography and art history, resulted in
the hybrid discourse we find in Breuil's and Capitan's studies of Les
Combarelles, for instance.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The ethnographic research of the same period did not remain
impregnable to the intrusion of these new discursive conventions and
classificatory epistemologies: as opposed to Reinach, who was writing
much earlier and thus had not read Breuil, Lindner, in <i>Die Jagd
der Vorzeit</i> of 1937, not only reiterates&#x02014;and thus tacitly
corroborates&#x02014;Breuil's chronological schema, but also insists upon
speaking of "oeuvres," "&#x000E9;coles," the "m&#x000E9;tier," and discrete
"styles" of Paleolithic image-making,


<b></b>


even while characterizing the producers of these "oeuvres" as
pelt-wearing, spear-launching sorcerer-magicians interested above all
in the capture of game.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, for prehistorians of Breuil's generation, the marks on cave
walls suddenly become chronotopic indexes of the discrete practices of
individuals, and not simply traces of homogeneous and unchanging cultural
rituals. Superimposed Paleolithic images, that is, lines crisscrossing or
res transgressing one another's boundaries (<i>empi&#x000E8;tement</i>)
within the same space (or upon the same picture plane), were understood
by the second wave of prehistorians to have been produced not only
successively but at widely disparate moments in history, although in
reality they had few tools for determining accurately which mark preceded
which. As the historian Marc Groenen has noted, Breuil merely shifted
onto a reading of the cave wall itself the archaeologist's stratigraphic
analysis of the cave <i>floor</i>, a type of analysis in which each layer
of earth (and therefore its contents: bones, pottery shards, and so on)
is taken to represent a different geological era. By focusing on the
superimposition of marks rather than the superimposition of soil layers,
Breuil had introduced a conceptual displacement, not a new forensic
technology. In Groenen's words, Breuil advanced "the prior acceptance of
a methodologically risky premise, namely, that <i>each recorded trace
materializes a distinct artistic phase of the Paleolithic Era</i>. To
establish his chronology, however, Breuil has to breathe a temporal
thickness [<i>insuffler une &#x000E9;paisseur temporelle</i>] between
each of the traces that compose the res. In reality, this temporal
thickness has no material substance [<i>n'est mat&#x000E9;rialis&#x000E9;e
par rien</i>]" ("PHP," 326; italics in original).
<p>
With the erection of Breuil's classifying system, the Paleolithic
artist was definitively ushered into the art historical pantheon. For
Breuil and his followers, the cave painter was first and foremost an
artist, not a libidinal child trailing his fingers across a cave wall
(<i>pace</i> Luquet), or a sorcerer engaged in a cultural practice
deriving its primary meaning from totemism or a ritual of sympathetic
magic (<i>pace</i> Reinach, Lindner, and B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n). However, if
Breuil successfully wrested cave imagery out of the fists of ethnographers
and historians of religion, thereby making it available to modernist
aesthetics and "imaginary museums," he simultaneously obscured the
specific cultural context of image-making, its imbrication in a set of
cultural practices that differed according to site, climate, community,
and so on.
<p>
Breuil's attempt to account for the superimposition of images
with recourse to an "&#x000E9;paisseur temporelle" may indeed have
lacked forensic or material support. Yet it spoke nonetheless to a
phenomenon that clearly demanded further consideration and study. With
the discovery of Gargas in 1906 and Trois Fr&#x000E8;res in 1916
(. <a href="#4">4</a> and <a href="#5">5</a>), it had
become evident to scholars of prehistory such as Breuil that something
unusual, something utterly foreign to contemporary artistic practices,
was at work in Paleolithic image-making. The fact that Paleolithic
image-makers superimposed one set of marks on another did not conform to
the simple widespread understanding of representation as governed by the
intention to imitate a preexisting re with a durable mark. Breuil's
chronology represented an effort to deal with the strangeness
of a phenomenon French prehistorians referred to in bewilderment as
<i>superposition,empi&#x000E8;tement,enchev&#x000EA;trement,entrecroisement,palimpseste,</i>
or simply <i>fouillimini</i>. The phenomenon

of superimposition that so intrigued the first observers of caves such as
Trois Fr&#x000E8;res and Lascaux could be neatly explained by recourse to
Breuil's narrative of temporal succession; different artists returned at
different points in history to redraw&#x02014;and, in Breuil's narrative,
to perfect&#x02014;the same limited vocabulary of res, sometimes
accidentally


<b></b>


covering over a portion of a previous rendering and thus creating
the impression of carelessness or lack of respect for what had come
before. But as convincing as Breuil's account might at first have
appeared, it was clear that it left many questions unresolved. In one of
his earliest attempts to describe the cave, entitled simply "Lascaux"
and published in <i>L'Anthropologie</i> in 1950 (an essay which left
a great impression on Bataille), Breuil is so stunned by the "tangle of
innumerable graffiti of deer, horse, and bison [<i>un enchev&#x000EA;trement
d'innombrables graffites de cerfs, chevaux, bisons</i>]" that he neglects
to apply his trusty chronological grid.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Although Breuil remembers to insist that "All that could not have
been the work of a single day or even a short period: generations of
artists worked there" ("L," 361), he tacitly admits a kind of exegetical
impotence when faced with the sheer quantity of interlocking, overlapping
res:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As one advances further, the state of the artworks improves,
although the painting still remains, in comparison with the first
hall, markedly weaker, even scarcely visible [<i>&#x000E0; peine
visible</i>]. Several layers are superimposed [<i>il y en a plusieurs
couches en superposition</i>]; the most recent are the best conserved,
the oldest are reduced to a tenuous shadow. This is true for the Great
Nave and the lower regions of the Great Dome where, <i>in infinite
number</i> [<i>en nombre infini</i>] hundreds and hundreds of engraved
res crisscross and recross&#x02014;immense brown steer, <i>visible
only from a distance and almost effaced</i>, or innumerable graffiti,
large and small, that benefit from the somber colors of the larger
beasts by exhibiting their incised white traces against the dark
background they provide. Generations and generations had to pass in
order to produce this accumulated <i>tangle of innumerable graffiti</i>
[<i>cet enchev&#x000EA;trement d'innombrables graffites</i>]&#x02014;of
deer, horse, bison&#x02014;amidst which I found a sole reindeer . . . While
contemplating this fading grandeur one experiences a feeling of amazement,
but also a certain sadness at finding such vestiges <i>at the very limit
of the visible</i> [<i>&#x000E0; la limite du visible</i>]. ["L," 360;
emphasis added]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Breuil alludes three times within one paragraph to the unquantifiable
plethora of res, "en nombre infini," "graffites, innombrables,"
"innombrables graffites." It is as though he were suddenly faced with
an incarnation of the mathematical sublime&#x02014;not up in the sky,
but beneath the earth, a cosmos turned inward or upside-down. There are
simply too many res, and they overlap with one another to such a great
degree, that the human eye is incapable of assimilating them. They are
"&#x000E0; la limite du visible," or "&#x000E0; peine visible." Breuil, of
course, is not entirely bereft of tools; in "Lascaux" he already produces
a rational explanation for the layering, or "superposition," of images as
the attempt on the part of later artists to "restore" the work of their
predecessors; "The Paleolithic artists thus restored certain parts of
the contours of animals painted before," he writes ("L," 360). What he
will term in <i>Quatre cent si&#x000E8;cles d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i> a
"veritable spider's web of graffiti of all dimensions" (<i>QCS,</i> 131)
may be due, he conjectures, to retouching. And yet this conjecture fails
to satisfy him. In the article for <i>L'Anthropologie,</i> Breuil simply
cannot encompass within scientific discourse the visual experience he
registers. The very hypervisibility of the res renders them barely
visible, "<i>&#x000E0; la limite du visible.</i>" Their alarming number
and diversity, the intensity of their entanglement, overwhelms Breuil's
narrative of viewing, and the exegetical force of the prehistorian's
temporal grid gives way beneath the weight of a kind of


<b></b>


a descriptive supplement, an overflow of superlative constructions that
reflect the observer's "wonder" and awe.
<p>
There is no doubt that Bataille was affected by this passage, which
does not, it is worth noting, appear in the same form two years later
in <i>Quatre cent si&#x000E8;cles d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i>.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
In a little red notebook marked "novembre 1953," which preserves
a record of the documents Bataille consulted while preparing
<i>Lascaux,</i> we find a telling allusion to Breuil's article. Beside
the reference&#x02014;"Breuil. Lascaux B.S.P.F. [acronym for <i>Bulletin
de la Soci&#x000E9;t&#x000E9; Pr&#x000E9;historique Fran&#x000E7;aise</i>]
t. 47 1950 no. 6-8"&#x02014;Bataille jots down the words "tr&#x000E8;s
important"&#x02014;a qualification which does not accompany any of the
other citations recorded in the notebook.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
As might be expected, elements of Breuil's account reappear in
Bataille's own description of the cave, especially, as we shall see,
in his description of the "Hall of the Bulls." Although Bataille is
clearly indebted to Breuil's more thorough account in <i>Quatre cent
si&#x000E8;cles d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i>, as well as that found in
Windels's <i>Lascaux, "Chapelle Sixtine" de la pr&#x000E9;histoire,</i>
it is Breuil's evocation of his own "&#x000E9;merveillement" before
the images, an "&#x000E9;merveillement" that registers the very limits
of visibility, that colors Bataille's own approach. "Marvel for the
eyes," Bataille writes in terms that recall Breuil (<i>L,</i> 43);
"At Lascaux, in the depths of the earth, what leads us astray, what
transres us, is the vision of the furthest distance [<i>la vision du
plus lointain</i>]. This message is, moreover, intensified by an inhuman
strangeness [<i>une &#x000E9;tranget&#x000E9; inhumaine</i>]. We see a
kind of round, an animal cavalcade, pursuing itself across the walls"
(<i>L,</i> 12). Breuil's "&#x000E9;merveillement" returns here as the
experience of being led outside of the self (<i>ce qui . . . nous
&#x000E9;gare</i>) or transred (<i>et nous transre</i>) by a
vision that transports us back to the most distant time, a vision,
one might say, of excessive distance itself (<i>la visiondu plus
lointain</i>), which fills us with amazement (<i>&#x000E9;tonnement</i>)
and admiration (<i>L,</i> 9). Without evoking the experience of blindness
(associated with gazing at "une &#x000E9;tranget&#x000E9; inhumaine"
in early essays such as "Soleil pourri"), Bataille nevertheless
accentuates the force of Lascaux as a visual spectacle, one that, at
least momentarily, overwhelms the archaeologist's interpretive grid. What
is communicated across the millennia&#x02014;for Bataille and for the
Breuil of "Lascaux"&#x02014;is less a composed scene than a confusing
palimpsest; the modern viewer sees <i>too much</i>&#x02014;too many lines,
too many forms&#x02014;and the eye reaches its own limit as an agent of
discernment (<i>&#x000E0; la limite du visible</i>) in an experience of
ecstatic visual satiation, or optical transgression, entirely familiar
to readers of <i>Histoire de l'oeil</i> or <i>L'Exp&#x000E9;rience
int&#x000E9;rieure</i>.
<p>
As Bataille proceeds to describe the cave in detail, however, he
will not remain in the role of ecstatic observer, but instead don the
hat of the scholar involved in sifting and classifying data. Moving
back and forth between the two roles assigned to him as author of a
commissioned volume, Bataille at one moment synthesizes the findings
of the "sp&#x000E9;cialistes" and then, at another, reconstructs these
findings with reference to his own optical impressions. The expressions
"give the impression" (<i>donnent l'impression</i>) and "to my eyes"
(<i>&#x000E0; mes yeux</i>) return insistently throughout the section
entitled "Description of the Grotto," indicating that Bataille is just as
concerned with recording what he construes to be an immediate response
to the spectacle as he is with accommodating the reader's demand for
scholarly synthesis. The following entry in


<b></b>


Bataille's little red notebook gives a sense of how Bataille was
negotiating between two exigencies: his desire to capture an initial,
spontaneous reaction to the cave images and his need to assimilate
these images into the systems of classification and forensic accounts
of production generated by the empirical research of archaeologists.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Immediately succeeding the reference to the Breuil citation (and
the words "tr&#x000E8;s important") we find a series of notes that
begin with the theme of visibility, then turn to the subject of
<i>facture</i>. The latter part of the entry is clearly indebted not
to Breuil's "Lascaux"&#x02014;which is fairly sketchy where forensic
evidence is concerned&#x02014;but to the much more polished account of
Lascaux offered by Windels in his <i>Lascaux, "Chapelle Sixtine" de
la pr&#x000E9;histoire</i>. (In the quotation below, I have tried to
imitate Bataille's own spacing.)

<p>
The first two lines could easily have been drawn directly from
Breuil's "Lascaux": the word "superposition" comes from the paragraph
reproduced above in which Breuil states that "[s]everal layers are
superimposed" and the expression "&#x000E0; perspective tordue" (distorted
perspective) appears in the very next paragraph ("L," 360). The re
"n&#x000E9;gligences de l'oeil" (carelessnesses of the eye) however,
does not appear in the Breuil text (nor in Windels's for that matter),
but seems nonetheless to correspond to the theme of visual confusion
that must have attracted Bataille's attention. Most interesting is
Bataille's insertion of the words "rien &#x000E0; voir" (nothing to
see) as if in the margins of his own notes, and then his subsequent
deletion, or crossing-out, of the word "rien." One is tempted to read
the crossing-out of "rien" as a case of what Bataille might have called
"contagion"; Bataille's own superimposition&#x02014;in which one mark
crosses over another mark&#x02014;appears to be a symptomatic repetition
of the very phenomenon he is describing.
<p>
Be that as it may, Bataille quickly turns away from a meditation on
what there is&#x02014;and isn't&#x02014;to see and begins a new set of
notes clearly taken from Windels's <i>Lascaux, la "Chapelle Sixtine"
de la pr&#x000E9;histoire</i>, a text which determines to a large extent
Bataille's


<b></b>


treatment of the "Hall of the Bulls" in <i>Lascaux</i>. The sequence
"oxyde min&#x000E9;raux" (mineral oxides), "d&#x000E9;layage dans l'eau
l'urine la graisse" (thinning in water urine grease) and so on, is lifted
with little modification from the section of Windel's book entitled
"Technique et Facture."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Elements of Windels's rendering are laced through his prose, although
he reserves his explicit discussion of technical matters for the "Notes
et Documentation" included at the very end of the volume. The reason
Windels is important to Bataille, however, is not that he supplies
details of manufacture but rather that he represents the extreme version
of an art historical perspective on Paleolithic image-making which
Bataille needs to respect if he is to vanquish the art-as-functional
approach of the comparative ethnographers. Whereas to the amazed Breuil
the cave images appear tangled (<i>enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;s</i>)
to the point of illegibility, Windels, in contrast, is assured that
even the "fouillis" (muddle) of this "extraordinary ensemble" will,
after adequate inspection, reveal a rigorous set of compositional
rules (<i>LCSP,</i> 17). Images that might be "barely recognizable"
(<i>LCSP,</i> 19) at the start will come into focus and the tangled,
superimposed res will resolve into carefully composed scenes. Such
must be the case if Lascaux is to prove comparable to the Sistine
Chapel. Thus, instead of resonating in awe to the miraculous spectacle
of "innombrables graffites," Windels celebrates the forensic tools
available for deciphering what will eventually be submitted to vision
as a set of clearly demarcated forms. The more one looks, the more
one will see. And this is true not simply because the images are each
complete in themselves, indexes of discrete (pre)historical epochs,
but also and even more importantly because these images are, contrary
to what one might think, disposed in arrangements that will prove
pleasing to the eye. They are, it turns out, by no means thrown together
"p&#x000EA;le-m&#x000EA;le" but instead "truly composed" (<i>LCSP,</i> 81).
<p>
In the pages of <i>Lascaux, la "Chapelle Sixtine" de la
pr&#x000E9;histoire</i>, Windels makes a strong claim for the cave,
insisting that its images surpass all found before insofar as they prove
prehistoric man <i>capable of composition</i>. "It has often been said
that quaternary artists were ignorant with respect to composition and
that they only knew how to depict isolated elements without thinking
about proportion or positioning," begins Windels; "the great majority of
Paleolithic works are formed of animals either superimposed one on top of
the other or scattered about in all directions with no apparent concern
for composition [<i>sans souci apparent de composition</i>]." Lascaux,
he continues, challenges previous conceptions of cave art, for here,
"several ensembles seem <i>truly composed</i>. . . . these groups testify
to the existence, in their authors, of <i>a sure and already evolved
sense of composition</i>" (<i>LCSP,</i> 81; emphasis added). Windels
might not be prepared to assert that all superimposed markings will,
under the penetrating gaze of the archaeologist, eventually resolve into
fully coherent compositions of well-defined res. But clearly his
emphasis is on finding order rather than disorder, and thus on revealing
continuities rather than discontinuities between the aesthetics of
Lascaux and the aesthetics of "modern man."
<p>
Compare Windels's account to Bataille's. As might be expected,
a continuity between "them" and "us"&#x02014;between the makers of the
"first" images and the modern viewers&#x02014;is also established, but
not on the same grounds. If we consider Bataille's


<b></b>


earliest treatment of Lascaux&#x02014;not in <i>Lascaux, ou la naissance
de l'art</i> but in his first sketch for the book, a presentation
before the Soci&#x000E9;t&#x000E9; d'Agriculture in 1952&#x02014;it is
immediately apparent where the accent is being placed. According to
Bataille, an "apparent concern for composition" (<i>un souci apparent
de composition</i>) is so little in evidence that Lascaux artists must
have been quite indifferent to the final effect: "It mattered little
to them that they effaced or obscured older images and that they ended
up with a tangled mass [<i>un enchev&#x000EA;trement</i>] <i>opposed to
any compositional principle</i> [<i>contraire &#x000E0; tout principe
de composition</i>]" (<i>L,</i> 327; emphasis added). Whereas Windels
enters the cave and clearly discerns a "sure and already evolved sense
of composition," Bataille remains skeptical. Are the superimposed images
"orderly" (<i>ordonn&#x000E9;es</i>), set into calculated arrangements,
and positioned with an eye to the ultimate achievement of a harmonious
composition? Or are the images heaped one on top of the other without
premeditation, indicating to the observer that perhaps aesthetic
preoccupations were subordinated to the act of production, to the
<i>performance</i>, or "<i>op&#x000E9;ration</i>" (as Bataille will put)
of mark-making itself?

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<i>"Ce qui est sensible &#x000E0; Lascaux, ce qui nous touche, est
ce qui bouge . . ."</i>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Much rides on the answer Bataille provides. If, on the one hand,
Bataille chooses to privilege his initial sense of "bewilderment"
(<i>&#x000E9;merveillement</i>), his vertigo before the apparent disorder
of the "res enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;es," he threatens to drive
a wedge between "l'homme de Lascaux" and modern man, for whom these
images remain indecipherable and strange. If, on the other, Bataille
insists upon the continuity between "l'homme de Lascaux" and modern
man, he implicitly suggests that their art manifests the same degree
of technical mastery and means-end rationality that characterizes fully
realized Western masterpieces such as the Sistine Chapel. In the latter
case, the images of Lascaux are denuded of their "&#x000E9;tranget&#x000E9;
inhumaine" as they become fully assimilated into modern conceptions
of composition, produced under the sign of the very instrumental,
work-related rationality that cave imagery is supposed to transgress. The
former case is equally disastrous, however, for if these images fail
to appear "composed," if the superimposed images really are a hopeless
"embrouillamini" (<i>L,</i> 59), they then fall back into "the animal
night" (<i>L,</i> 44) of the "primitive" and the childish. Bataille
is thus stuck in a double bind. In <i>Lascaux</i> he must locate a
compositional principle deep in the cave, for such a principle has,
in his text and in paleographic scholarship in general, become the very
index of an independent aesthetic sense. Yet, neither is it sufficient
for Bataille to announce that a compositional principle is indeed at
work, since the "&#x000E9;merveillement" Bataille seeks to convey owes
not a little to the vertigo experienced by the viewer, that is, to the
viewer's impression that the images <i>resist</i> a clear compositional
orientation. In order to resolve this dilemma, Bataille ingeniously comes
up with the oxymoronic notion of an <i>animal composition</i>, or, as
he calls it elsewhere, a "composition mouvement&#x000E9;e" (<i>L,</i> 49).
<p>
Bataille places the accent on movement throughout his detailed account
of the cave. In particular, he focuses on the ways in which movement is
captured in composed


<b></b>


groups when he describes the Hall of the Bulls, a long hallway in
which depictions of large mammal bodies are crisscrossed and entangled,
transgressing both corporeal and compositional frames. His description
begins, benignly enough, with a rehearsal of Windel's flattering
comparison between Lascaux and the Sistine Chapel:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Hall of the Bulls is about ten meters wide, thirty meters long,
but the <i>arrangement</i> [<i>la disposition</i>]<i>, the order</i>
[<i>l'ordonnance</i>]<i>, in truth disordered</i> [<i>&#x000E0; la
v&#x000E9;rit&#x000E9; d&#x000E9;sordonn&#x000E9;e</i>], of the frieze
that unwinds there gives the impression of a sort of rotunda. . . . No
other painted hall presents such a harmonious ensemble [<i>un ensemble
plus heureux</i>]. Someone once said: "Lascaux, the Sistine Chapel
of Prehistory" . . . But <i>to my eyes</i>, the Sistine Chapel, the
res of which are certainly more dramatic, nevertheless offers a
more conventional arrangement: charm, surprise, these are found at
Lascaux. [<i>L,</i> 44; emphasis added]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From here, Bataille goes on to peruse the contents of the Hall&#x02014;a
long "animal frieze dominated by four gigantic bulls" and "a horde of
entangled animals" (<i>un peuple d'animaux enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;s</i>)
(<i>L,</i> 44). He then notes the dome-shaped ceiling of the cave,
which justifies Windels's comparison to Michelangelo's spherical support
(<i>L,</i> 45). Finally, he muses on the composition of the res
projected onto this support, concluding that

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In this way, one after the other men arranged [<i>ordonn&#x000E8;rent</i>]
these res, although a final ensemble was never their objective. They
positioned these res by instinct in such a way that, in the end,
an ensemble formed all on its own. . . . and, since nothing during
their period prohibited it, they often allowed one painting to encroach
on an earlier painting [<i>ils empi&#x000E9;t&#x000E8;rent souvent sur
les parties peintes auparavant</i>]; however, rarely did they disturb
[<i>ils d&#x000E9;rang&#x000E8;rent rarement</i>] that which came before
if it contributed to the magnificence of the Hall . . . [<i>L,</i> 45]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A glance at the photograph of the Rotunda in the Hall of the Bulls that
accompanied Bataille's text suggests precisely what he was looking at when
writing the words above (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). In his description,
Bataille seems torn between, on the one hand, his desire to express
astonishment at the way in which the res encroach upon one another
and, on the other, his desire to confirm the Lascaux painter's sense of
a larger "ensemble," his awareness of the need to maintain some sense
of order. When Bataille refers to the Hall's "magnificence" he seems to
be thinking of the four bulls whose large dimensions dominate the frieze
and lend the Rotunda its dramatic quality. It is true that the rative
power of the outlined bulls is not, as Bataille insists, diminished by the
"empi&#x000E8;tement," that is, by the intrusion of other, less refined
res. The magnificence of the Hall might even owe quite a bit to the
phenomenon of superimposition itself. Yet it is equally clear that no
discernable compositional principle is directing the order or rhythm of
the superimpositions. Thus the question remains&#x02014;raised by this
passage and by many others like it&#x02014;why the Lascaux painter did
not choose to respect the borders of the animals already represented,
why he consistently made one re act as the ground of the next,
thereby confusing one of the distinctions central to the development of
Western illusionist painting (<a href="#7"> 7</a>). If Lascaux
man was indeed


<b></b>


capable of composition, and therefore of caring about the way in which
the res were positioned with respect to one another, then why did
he so often ignore the boundaries of earlier res and threaten the
majesty of the final effect?

<p>
In an effort to avoid either reducing the phenomenon of superimposition
to a "fouillis . . . d'innombrable gravures enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;es"
(<i>L,</i> 58) or, conversely, elevating&#x02014;and thus
domesticating&#x02014;the phenomenon by revealing the work of hidden
calculation, Bataille


<b></b>


offers the paradox of unintentional order (or what he calls an
"ordonnance . . . d&#x000E9;sordonn&#x000E9;e"). There is indeed a "calcul"
(calculation) governing the distribution of res on the cave walls,
but, he hastens to add, it has nothing to do with the instrumental
rationality of, for instance, vanishing point perspective: "This
calculation [<i>Ce calcul</i>] must not be identified with the type of
calculation that art would later make its own" (<i>L,</i> 46). Further,
although it might appear that "the individual elements are subordinated
to the final ensemble," such subordination is not imposed externally but
arrived at organically, as a result of a "blind," "animal" assurance:
"there is something <i>animal-like</i> [<i>quelque chose d'animal</i>]in
the <i>blind assurance</i> [<i>l'aveugle s&#x000FB;ret&#x000E9;</i>]
with which the Lascaux painters, <i>without ever having planned it</i>
[<i>sans l'avoir jamais concert&#x000E9;</i>], attained their result"
(<i>L,</i> 46; emphasis added). Thus, even as Bataille notes that an
"ensemble" emerges out of the mass of superimposed res, he stresses
that this ensemble was never intended, was never "their object." The
composition at work in the cave is linked not to calculation but to
"blind instinct," to repeated gestures associated with somatic (as
opposed to rational) knowledge. Finally, lest the weight of words like
"composition," "ordonnance," and "calcul" fall too heavily on the ears of
his audience, Bataille reiterates a few pages later, in his description of
a gallery further down, the words "instinct" and "chance" with reference,
once again, to composition. "I want to emphasize the charm derived from
this order [<i>ordonnance</i>], arrived at through chance and <i>blind
instinct</i> alone" (<i>L,</i> 51; emphasis added).
<p>
At times, Bataille appears to parse out the opposition between
"calculation" and "blind instinct," or aesthetic rationality and
spontaneous, instinctual marking, along a spectrum of depictions, with,
on the one hand, the most distinct and obviously composed res serving
to embody the advanced capacities of prehistoric artists, and, on the
other, the most indistinguishable and tumultuously juxtaposed res
representing the less familiar practices of a variety of man that remains
strange to us. For instance, in the Axial Gallery, Bataille discovers
what looks like "three Chinese horses," a set of delicate res
that seem to him to be among "the most refined, the most attractive of
Lascaux" (<i>L,</i> 51), neatly outlined and distinguished from the other
res in a composition that comes close to suggesting a scene. On the
other end of the spectrum is the "series of a dozen or so small horses"
stretching across the back wall, which seem to be traced more summarily,
with less attention to final effect. "These animals," notes Bataille,
"are distinguished from the others <i>arranged</i> in the Hall by
their vague and undecided aspect: they are, in this sense, more animal,
<i>liberated of all intention</i>" (<i>L,</i> 53; emphasis added).
<p>
The reader is here reminded of Bataille's earlier review article
on Luquet's <i>Art primitif</i> in which he argues that two kinds
of art&#x02014;that which is refined and that which projects a "vague
aspect"&#x02014;emerge from a single impulse to "alter." However, there is
no mention in <i>Lascaux</i> of the word "alteration" (nor does the word
"graffiti" ever appear, and thus the issue of defacement in the caves
is not broached).
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Furthermore, in <i>Lascaux</i>, Bataille repudiates in no uncertain
terms Luquet's thesis that prehistoric art bears a kinship with the
drawings of "primitives" (indigenous peoples) or children.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
What Bataille does retain from his previous work on Luquet is the
idea that


<b></b>


both kinds of depictions, the refined and the summary, the intentionally
arranged and the chaotic, originate in a more fundamental impulse,
a libidinal impulse, motivating the expenditure of physical energy in
the making of the mark.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Both the orderly and the seemingly disorderly are animated by the same
dynamism, by a compositional principle that, in effect, is not so much
a principle as a force expressing "quelque chose d'animal" (<i>L,</i>
46). This force is so strong that no composed, independent grouping,
even that of the subtly executed horses, can remain unaffected by the
"vaste mouvement" ultimately governing the constellation of images
throughout the cave (<i>L,</i> 51). Sometimes this movement seems to
be propelling all the res in the same direction, as in the Hall of
the Bulls, where Bataille discovers in the "cavalcade spectaculaire"
"un mouvement unique"; at other times, as in the Axial Gallery, the
res seems to move "in all directions, upsetting the possibility
of an ensemble with the suddenness of a leap" (<i>L,</i> 49). In all
cases, however, underlying depiction at Lascaux is something strange
and seductive to which we are sensitive&#x02014;"ce qui nous touche. . . est <i>ce qui bouge"</i> (that which touches us . . . is <i>that
which moves</i>)&#x02014;something that expresses "with a strength
never surpassed an animal violence, anguished, erotic, and blind"
(<i>L,</i> 57).
<p>
Bataille's allusion to an "anguished," "blind," and "erotic
violence"&#x02014;which he treats as both the theme of the images and
the impulse generating them&#x02014;recalls the very terms he borrowed
earlier from Luquet in <i>L'Art primitif</i>. Whereas Bataille clearly
wants to avoid identifying the Lascaux images with the art of children
and "primitives," he nonetheless has to strive to prevent comparisons
between the cave and the Sistine Chapel from domesticating the frenetic
energies he sees reflected on the cave walls. In a sense, then, Bataille
needs Luquet's emphasis on the libidinal origins of mark-making to
oppose the excesses of art historians such as Windels, and he needs
Windels's emphasis on aesthetic rationality to oppose the excesses of
comparative ethnographers and psychologists such as Luquet. For Windels,
the phenomenon of superimposition indicates man's search for perfection,
his ever-increasing capacity to make mimetic forms that fall into orderly
patterns. For Luquet, in contrast, the phenomenon of superimposition is
evidence of an "imitation machinale," a kind of instinctual urge to make
and leave traces.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Finally, for Bataille, superimposition is the phenomenon that places
the two&#x02014;the instinctual and the technical, the disorderly and the
orderly&#x02014;within one space; but the point is not simply that creation
and deformation coincide as one re encroaches upon another, but
more that the production of a clear ration, a composed "ensemble,"
<i>is not the goal of aesthetic behavior</i>. The nearly ubiquitous
phenomenon of superimposition in Paleolithic representation suggests
that the process, and not the product, is sovereign. By concentrating
on this phenomenon, on the way it unsettles familiar accounts of
artistic production, Bataille thus manages to chart a course through
the choppy waters of Paleolithic scholarship, which tends to err either
by denying Paleolithic man an artistic practice (because there is no
"souci de composition"), or by reducing all Paleolithic expressions to
the monumental, static beauty of Greek, Roman, and Renaissance models.


<b></b>


<p>
Alone among Bataille scholars, the art historian Georges Didi-Huberman
has recognized to what a great extent the phenomenon of superimposition
encapsulates, for Bataille, the enigma of aesthetic practice itself. In
<i>La Ressemblance informe,</i> Didi-Huberman suggests that <i>Lascaux</i>
merely approaches from a new angle questions concerning the kinetic
element of artistic production first raised in <i>Documents:</i>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When Bataille . . . describes in "L'Art primitif" what seems to constitute
the most elementary dialectic of alteration&#x02014;the rhythmic act of
aggression against a support, the discovery in this rhythm of visual
resemblances, the reproduction of these resemblances, then another
act of aggression in a process of "successive destructions"&#x02014;he
touches on one of the major problems he will treat in his work, the full
implications of which will not be explored until twenty-five years later,
in his book on Lascaux. [<i>RI,</i> 277]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "rhythmic act of aggression against a support" is related,
Didi-Huberman claims, to what Bataille observed in the caves, a "travail
d'empi&#x000E8;tement" (the work of encroachment) or "enchev&#x000EA;trement"
that produces form but also, by neglecting a previous form's integrity,
alters form beyond recognition (<i>RI,</i> 277). Didi-Huberman confirms
the connection, therefore, between nonrative tracings (such as those
studied by Luquet at Gargas) and the rative depictions Bataille finds
heaped in tangled masses on the walls of Lascaux; both are generated
by "rhythmic acts of aggression," the repeated gestures of a body in
motion. The phenomenon of superimposition in particular, it would seem,
reveals the fundamental ambiguity of aesthetic behavior, testifying,
in Didi-Huberman's terms, to a contact between the subject as producer,
possessing agency and intention, and the subject as "subjectile," energy
"thrown" (<i>jet&#x000E9;e</i> [<i>RI,</i> 277]), or, as Jacques Derrida
has put it, "force before form."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
The mark left behind registers the quantity of physical force
applied, a force that is subjectivity embodied in space, duration,
and movement. The practice of "enchev&#x000EA;trement," Didi-Huberman
writes, produces the impression that static forms are provisional and
expendable expressions of this underlying kinetic force; what perdures,
beyond the forms themselves, is movement&#x02014;"an extraordinary
<i>movement</i> that confounds the spectator" (<i>RI,</i> 277; italics
in original). Form communicates the movements that constituted it;
viewing bodies not only respond viscerally to these movements but,
in the case of the image-makers, viewing bodies <i>prolong</i> these
movements by repeating them, by joining the dance of mark-marking once
again, contributing to "an image that will never cease being constructed,
growing through its alterations from one generation of artists to the
next . . ." (<i>RI,</i> 278).
<p>
Finally, what Bataille sees at Lascaux is not simply a "fouillis de
peintures" or an "embrouillamini" of innumerable, interlocking res,
but also, Didi-Huberman concludes, a "<i>temporal</i> function of
representation." Bataille "saw that superimposition and encroachment
[<i>l'enchev&#x000EA;trement et l'empi&#x000E8;tement</i>] themselves imply
an essential anthropological function, a <i>temporal</i> function of
ration" (<i>RI,</i> 278; italics in original). Superimposed images
seem to materialize temporal passage, providing, as Didi-Huberman remarks,
an "anthropological" context for image-making, a clear reference to
successive generations. The "exub&#x000E9;rance" of their multiplicitous
interweavings suggests


<b></b>


both a past and a future of the mark-making impulse (<i>RI,</i> 278). But
to make this observation is really no more than to reiterate the point
Breuil had already made concerning the chronology of the different sets
of marks. What Didi-Huberman could have emphasized more strongly is that
the gestures required for mark-making (intentionally or accidentally
altering a support, intentionally or accidentally creating an image),
also take place in time, are performed within duration. It may be that
the successive strokes point to a future of further alterations ("an
image that will never cease being constructed"). But these strokes also
testify to the importance of <i>their performance in lived time</i>. The
act of executing the movements involved in the <i>performance</i> might
very well have held greater value for Paleolithic producers than did
the images (products) themselves. And this possibility is confirmed by
Bataille himself: "The entanglement of res," he writes, "signifies
that existing decorations were of negligible importance at the moment
when a new mark was made. In this moment, whether or not the new mark
destroyed the former and perhaps more beautiful one was a secondary
concern" (<i>L,</i> 79).
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>
Such, ultimately, is Bataille's conclusion. Certainly, on one level,
the movement propelling the repetition of marks is simply "the
agitation of forms [<i>la mise en mouvement des formes</i>] and the
continual reinvention of their relations," as Didi-Huberman would have it
(<i>RI,</i> 279). But Bataille suggests further that Lascaux man may not
have been as interested in altering forms or reinventing their relations
as he was in <i>repeating certain gestures,</i> gestures that formed
part of a ritual performance, or a dance. Bataille makes it clear that
he does not understand art (as finished product) to be subordinate to
the performance of instrumental rituals; but he does intimate that both
art <i>and</i> instrumental rituals are subordinate to something else,
something sovereign: namely, the motricity of the body itself. Throughout
<i>Lascaux</i>, Bataille returns again and again to the theme of movement,
a "mouvement de jeu," a "mouvement de f&#x000EA;te," and a "mouvement"
of transgression (<i>L,</i> 40-2), all of which constitute related
incarnations of "un mouvement ind&#x000E9;termin&#x000E9; dans son essence"
(<i>L,</i> 48), or movement itself. It is this indeterminate movement that
propels Lascaux man from "animal night" to the portal of civilization;
but it is also, paradoxically, this indeterminate movement that helps him
recover, transgressively, the joy and anguish of "la sensibilit&#x000E9;
imm&#x000E9;diate." Image-making draws on this indeterminate movement,
this force, modeling physical expressions of the body in order to produce
material results.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
While it might at first seem that Bataille is merely using the term
"mouvement" ratively (as a synonym for "impulse," for instance), it
becomes fully apparent in his conclusion that "mouvement" is to be taken
quite literally, as the body's displacement in space, or, as he writes,
a "mouvement de danse" (<i>L,</i> 80). Bataille closes <i>Lascaux</i>
by reflecting at some length upon the imbrication of image-making in
ritual choreographies. "What distinguishes the images of Lascaux in
general is that they are integrated into rites," begins Bataille:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We do not know what these rites were, but we are encouraged to
believe that the execution of the paintings comprised one of their
elements. Tracing a re did not, perhaps, on its own constitute a
ceremony; but it was certainly an essential part of a ceremony.


<b></b>


Tracing was an <i>operation</i>, religious or magic. . . . Concern for the
final effect clearly emerged at Lascaux&#x02014;in the arrangement of the
Great Hall, or in the Gallery, for instance. However, of this we can be
sure: the final effect of the ensemble was of secondary importance. Only
the operation [of tracing] corresponded to the underlying intention. The
majesty of the cavern appeared afterwards, serendipitous, like a gift,
or the sign of divinity. [<i>L,</i> 79; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Whereas earlier, Bataille had sought to disentangle artistic processes
from ritual intentions, here he resituates image-making in the larger
context of a coordinated "<i>op&#x000E9;ration.</i>" Bataille even
insists that completing this operation was the primary intention of
the image-maker; the beauty of the image produced was simply a "don du
hasard" (or a sign of divinity). What is most important to Bataille,
then, is not the secondary purpose Paleolithic man believed he was
fulfilling&#x02014;propitiating a god, assuring the abundance of the
harvest or of the hunt, or even creating a "work of art"&#x02014;but rather
the corporeal energy the operation was modeling. It is ultimately this
energy, the energy of moving bodies, that is communicated to us from the
walls of the cave. The instrumentality of the ritual, the <i>opera</i>
(labor) of the "op&#x000E9;ration," gives temporary and fleeting form to
a physical force that always wants to reach beyond it&#x02014;to further
depictions, or to us:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What we feel at Lascaux, what touches us . . . <i>is that which moves</i>
[<i>Ce qui est sensible &#x000E0; Lascaux, ce qui nous touche . . .</i>
est ce qui bouge]. A feeling of the spirit dancing [<i>Un sentiment de
danse de l'esprit</i>] uplifts us before these works in which, without
regimentation [<i>sans routine</i>] beauty emanates from feverish
movements. . . . This movement of feverish dance [<i>Ce mouvement de
danse enivr&#x000E9;e</i>] always had the force to elevate art above the
subordinate tasks it accepted, tasks that religion or magic imposed upon
it . . . This free movement is most palpable [<i>le plus sensible</i>]
at Lascaux . . ." [<i>L,</i> 80-1; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "mouvement de danse" to which Bataille refers is responsible both for
lifting the images above their limited, local tasks and for <i>bringing
the images into existencein the first place</i>. For such dance movements,
or choreographed gestures (organized into what Leroi-Gourhan calls
"operating chains"), must be performed in order for ration to
gain a visible being. Further, not only are material bodies involved
in the execution of images, but material bodies, <i>our</i> material
bodies, Bataille seems to be saying, are involved in perceiving and
appreciating images. Our bodies resonate to the movement captured on,
and communicated to us through, the cave walls. The images of Lascaux are
therefore movement (space, duration) made <i>sensible</i> to us through
our eyes. While describing Lascaux, Bataille concentrates more often
than not on what the viewer <i>feels</i> rather than on what he sees
(although we are always feeling <i>through</i> our optical organs). We
are "touched" in the cave, he writes, by that which "<i>moves,</i>" or,
to put it in slightly more phenomenological terms, we see movement and
are moved&#x02014;inspired to move&#x02014;by what we see. As if to lend
support to such a phenomenology of vision, Merleau-Ponty, in the last
essay he wrote before his death in 1960, seconds Bataille's motion:
"An instrument that itself moves . . . ," we read in <i>L'Oeil et
l'esprit,</i> "the eye is <i>that which</i> was moved [<i>&#x000E9;mu</i>]
by a certain impact of the world and returns this world to visibility
by means of the tracings of the hand [<i>par les traces de la main</i>].


<b></b>


No matter where it is born, no matter what ceremonies surround it, and
even if it was placed in the service of something entirely different,
painting&#x02014;from Lascaux to now&#x02014;never celebrates anything
other than the enigma of visibility . . . Painting awakens; it brings
to its greatest point of intensity the delirium that is vision itself
[<i>un d&#x000E9;lire qui est la vision m&#x000EA;me</i>]."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
Bataille also ends his <i>Lascaux</i> with reference to seeing as a kind
of "d&#x000E9;lire." Not only does looking at the cave walls produce in
him a sense of "&#x000E9;merveillement," but he finds that his visual
experience causes his spirit to "dance"; he is affected viscerally by
the imagery's "danse &#x000E9;nivr&#x000E9;e" (<i>L,</i> 81). This "danse
enivr&#x000E9;e" which the eye experiences when observing the images
on the support of the cave is related in Bataille's text to the "danse
enivr&#x000E9;e" of the ritual during which, hypothetically, the images
were produced in the cave. Although Bataille's strongest influences,
Breuil and Windels, make only passing reference to such dances, they too
tacitly advance the notion that cave images were executed during a ritual
performance. Recent research on cave images, both ancient and modern,
has supported, in fact, the turn-of-the-century ethnographer's suggestion
that various forms of inscription (tracing, drawing, even notation and
therefore early writing systems) originated in rituals involving not
only choreographed movements, but also the production, with the aid of a
shaman, of visual hallucinations. According to contemporary paleographers
Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams, it was these visual hallucinations
that prered and determined the images to be projected onto the cave
walls, while the choreographed movements of ritual dances provided the
first gestures responsible, eventually, for all varieties of inscription.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The origin of art&#x02014;and the source of art's "elevation" above its
culturally assigned tasks&#x02014;turns out to be not a rage for order
but a delirious dance.
<p>
Bataille did not live long enough to witness the return of Paleolithic
archaeology to a more anthropological, comparatist perspective. And
he probably would have been uncomfortable with the relation assumed
between depictive practices and particular belief systems (associated
with the shamanic practice of healing or conjuring). However, the aspect
of contemporary archaeology that he would have appreciated, and that his
own study anticipated, is the tendency exemplified by Lewis-Williams and
Clottes to approach aesthetic behaviors as implicated in a quest for the
sacred through rhythmic movement, such movement being understood as an
end in itself. Central to Paleolithic image-makers, such a notion implies,
was not the accuracy or perfection of the depictions, but rather <i>that
they were performed</i>. What mattered, in other words, was that the
gestures of mark-making were repeated in a sacred space&#x02014;such as
the cave, an underworld or alternative virtual universe populated with
hallucinated images that one could both see and retrace. Bataille himself
informs us at the beginning of <i>Lascaux</i> that he would not have been
able to experience Lascaux fully without placing his own body in that
same sacred space of the cave. Clearly, for Bataille, using the eyes is
by no means an act detached from the rest of the body. Seeing and being
"moved," gesturing and making visual images, are mutually implicated
aesthetic&#x02014;and sensual&#x02014;practices. The inevitable response
to the visual world is to leave, as Merleau-Ponty puts it, "les traces
de la main." Writing <i>Lascaux</i> (see <a href="#8"> 8</a>)
represents Bataille's own participation in that dance of the hand.

The prefatory materials to the original <i>&#x000E9;dition de
luxe</i> of 1955, the full title of which was <i>La Peinture
pr&#x000E9;historique. Lascaux ou la naissance de l'art,</i> indicate
that the project was the joint brain-child of Bataille and Albert Skira,
editor of the series in which it appeared, "Les Grands Si&#x000E8;cles
de la peinture." Apparently, it was Bataille who, having been solicited
by Skira to contribute to the series, "suggested the idea" of a book
on Lascaux, perhaps as a complement to his study of modern painting
entitled <i>Manet</i> printed in the series the same year. See Georges
Bataille, <i>Lascaux, ou la naissance de l'art,</i> in <i>Oeuvres

<i>Lascaux</i> is too often placed in the service of reconfirming
Bataille's "transgressive" stance vis-&#x000E0;-vis academic conventions
and disciplinary procedures. Steven Ungar's defense of the work in
"Phantom Lascaux, Origin of the Work of Art," for instance, rests
largely on a vision of <i>Lascaux</i> as transgressive that cannot be
substantiated (<i>Yale French Studies</i> 78, "On Bataille," ed. Alan
Stoekl [1990]). Although Ungar claims that Bataille's "gestures of
transgression" produce "textual effects [in <i>Lascaux</i>] whose
intensity is unsettling" , he provides no example of these

Bataille spent some time ascertaining the exact circumstances of the
cave's discovery. In a paper he gave in 1955 (on the occasion of the
presentation of a film on Lascaux), he informs his audience that two
of the boys who came upon the cave opening (exposed when a tree was
uprooted by


<b></b>


a storm) were in fact not local P&#x000E9;rigordians, but rather wartime
refugees from Paris. One of the boys, Bataille claims, was Jewish. It
seems that the three of them had gone off to "play war" with a group
of Alsatian boys, also refugees, staying in the area. In search of
their companions, they bump into Marcel Ravidat, a P&#x000E9;rigordien,
who had heard from a neighbor about a mysterious hole possibly leading
to a cave. The three boys decide to join Ravidat&#x02014;and the rest
is history. See "Conf&#x000E9;rence du 18 janvier 1955," in <i>Oeuvres
compl&#x000E8;tes,</i> 9:336. I have not found evidence to corroborate
Bataille's account, but I am nonetheless moved that he wanted to
communicate to his audience that the popularized version (the one shown
in the film) passes in silence over the participation of a Jewish boy
in the discovery of one of France's most important national treasures.

Bataille's own text forces me to depict the Lascaux painters as "men." As

adult; see "Beyond Art."

The urge Bataille exhibits to associate the emergence of mankind with
the birth of art reveals his Eurocentric cast of mind, as well as
that of Western European prehistorians working from the time decorated
caves were first discovered in 1837 until Bataille's generation. Recent
findings prove that <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i> existed in places other
than France and Spain long before the cave images were produced. Conkey
summarizes these findings in "Beyond Art": "<i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i>
(anatomically-modern humans) now appear to have established themselves
outside of Europe a considerable time before the appearance there of
preserved Upper Paleolithic imagery at some 32,000 years ago . . . there
is increasing support for image-making or at least 'marking' at comparably
early dates elsewhere (in southern Africa and Australia, at least). Thus,
the Upper Paleolithic imagery of Eurasia is liberated from what has
been persistent, almost 'vitalistic' concepts of 'context' in which the
art 'happens' with modern humans, and the European materials are the
<i>origins</i> of art" (344; italics in original). On the significance
of Lascaux for European self-conceptions, see also Jean-Paul Demoule,
"Lascaux," in <i>Les Lieux de la m&#x000E9;moire,</i> ed. Pierre Nora
(Paris: Gallimard, 1997).
<p>
<a name="FOOT17" href="#REF17">17</a>.
Much could be&#x02014;and has been&#x02014;said about Bataille's concern
with the distinction between the animal and the human. From his very
earliest essays, such as "Le Gros Orteil" (The big toe) of 1929, on,
Bataille is working out a theory of man's relation to the animal. In
<i>Th&#x000E9;orie de la religion</i>, for instance, Bataille suggests
that man's sense of superiority over the animals is tempered by his
inarticulable intimation of continuity with them.
<p>
<a name="FOOT18" href="#REF18">18</a>.
The first scholar to focus attention on unique patterns within
a single cave (rather than generating abstract theories based on
ethnographic comparisons) was the Polish/German art historian, Max
Rapha&#x000EB;l; see his <i>Prehistoric Cave Painting</i> (New York:
Pantheon, 1945). The French structuralist, Andr&#x000E9; Leroi-Gourhan,
followed suit a generation later. Leroi-Gourhan's major work on the
mythic structures of cave representations is <i>Pr&#x000E9;histoire de
l'art occidental</i> (Paris: Mazenod, 1965); <i>Treasures of Prehistoric
Art,</i> trans. Norbert Guterman (New York: Abrams, 1965). Here he
argues that at Lascaux, the marks interpreted as "arrows" by promoters
of the hunting magic theory are actually "male" and "female" signs:
"male symbols are inserted into the large compositions, the most
frequent type of which is based on the grouping comprising bison/horse
with female-signs/male-signs . . . In other words, it is highly probable
that Paleolithic men were expressing something like 'spear is to penis'
as 'wound is to vulva'" (172-3). An important, but less well-known
prehistorian was Annette Laming-Emperaire; in <i>La Signification de
l'art rupestre pal&#x000E9;olithique</i> (Paris: Picard, 1962) she had
the prescience to guide scholarship toward considering each cave in its
specific context. On the significance of Leroi-Gourhan and his followers,
see Jean Clottes, "Art of the Light and Art of the Depths," in Conkey,
ed., <i>Beyond Art</i>.

the Stone, the Bronze, and the Iron. It was believed that indigenous
tribal peoples of Australia and Africa lived in the same way in the
twentieth century as did "savages" of the first evolutionary period,
known as the Stone Age, or "l'&#x000C2;ge du renne" (the Reindeer Age).

Bataille was, it should be noted, impressed by Evelyne Lot-Falck's <i>Les
Rites de chasse chez les peuples sib&#x000E9;riens,</i> published in 1953
and included in his bibliography. He returns to Lot-Falck's theory in
<i>L'&#x000C9;rotisme</i> (without citing her) in his discussion of the
"Scene in the Shaft." Bataille prefers Lot-Falck's theory to Lindner's
because she places greater emphasis on the religious signification (rather
than the instrumental value) of depiction as part of sympathetic magic
rituals. For further analysis of Lot-Falck's place in the evolution of
paleographic archaeology, see Mario Ruspoli, <i>The Cave of Lascaux:
The Final Photographic Record</i> (London: Thames and Hudson, 1987), 62-4.

See "Architecture," from the "Dictionnaire critique" published in
<i>Documents,</i> no. 2  in which Bataille distinguishes modern
painting (by which he means the works of Picasso, Masson, Van Gogh,
and Dali) from forms of art which he believes to be in the service of
repressions (prohibitions): "as strange as it might seem when what is
in question is a creature as elegant as the human being, these [modern]
painters indicate a path leading toward bestial monstrosity; as though
there were no other chance of escaping from the architectural prison
[<i>la chiourme architecturale</i>]" (Georges Bataille, <i>Documents,</i>

<i>graffite</i> in paleography, but my own reading of a large number of
articles in anthropological and archaeological journals suggests that
the term was used early on (mid-nineteenth century) to designate cave
depictions that had not yet entered the field of art history. The terms
<i>graffite</i> and <i>graffiti</i> slowly drop out of usage and are
replaced by <i>peintures</i> and <i>gravures</i> as an art historical
approach assumes dominance in paleographic research. As we shall see,
the term <i>graffite</i> is reserved by Breuil to refer uniquely to
those inscriptions&#x02014;engraved or painted&#x02014;that appear either
unfinished, carelessly traced, or repetitively superimposed.

Certain aspects of Reinach's theory leave their traces even in Breuil's
most mature writings, notably his famous <i>Quatre cents si&#x000E8;cles

that "when we visit a decorated cavern, we penetrate a sanctuary where,
thousands of years ago, sacred ceremonies took place" (<i>QCS,</i>
23), or when he seems to adopt the view of a fellow prehistorian,
Maxime Vaultier, that the human re found in the "Hall of the Bulls"
represents a "Sorcerer" (<i>QCS,</i> 130).

Cartailhac as well as Breuil with ushering cave images into the domain

On the Hegelian (teleological and developmental) cast of nineteenth- and
early twentieth-century art history, see Michael Podro, <i>The Critical
Historians of Art</i> (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1982). On
French art history in particular, see Udo Kultermann, <i>The History of
Art History</i> (n.p.: Abaris Books, 1993). During the nineteenth century,
French art history was influenced by Burckhardt's large, overarching
historical concepts and Taine's sense of periodization. By the end of
the century, Elie Faure had broadened the curriculum to include the
study of "primitive" arts; Saloman Reinach and Paul Gauguin also had
a significant impact on art history's growing interest in non-Western
(and prehistorical) arts. Breuil (1877-1961) emerged out of this context.

See L. Capitan, L'Abb&#x000E9; H. Breuil, and D. Peyrony, <i>Les
Combarelles aux Ezies (Dordogne)</i> (Paris: Masson, 1924), which is
full of references to "styles," "oeuvres d'art," and so on, even as it
continually compares Paleolithic images to those produced by contemporary
hunter-gatherer societies considered primitive ("arri&#x000E9;r&#x000E9;")
by the same authors.

"A limited circle of gifted individuals, who certainly came
from the ranks of professional magicians [<i>des magiciens de

[<i>leur style propre</i>]. The young artist [<i>Le jeune artiste</i>]

before being allowed to take on the greatest tasks that awaited him"
(Lindner, <i>Chasse pr&#x000E9;historique,</i> 275). I suspect that
Lindner's source for these terms is a work by Breuil's associates,
L. Capitan and J. Bouyssonie, <i>Un atelier d'art pr&#x000E9;historique:
Limeuil</i> (Paris, 1924). Lindner also applies verbatim Breuil's
art historical chronological frame for interpreting cave imagery; see
pp. 252-4. Needless to say, Breuil's chronological system as well as
Leroi-Gourhan's revision of it have been completely debunked as a result
of the discovery of Chauvet Pont d'Arc in the Ard&#x000E8;che. Scholars are
still debating the age of Chauvet; the first radiocarbon datings suggested
that paintings were executed between 31,000 and 26,000 <small>B.C.</small>

This little red notebook can be found in the Fonds Bataille housed in
the Cabinet des Manuscrits of the Biblioth&#x000E8;que nationale de Paris,
Rue Richelieu (Fonds Bataille, bo&#x000EE;te no. 3, dossier XI). The remarks
jotted down in this modest notebook led me to consider the phenomenon of
superimposition&#x02014;and thus the places where it appears, such as the
Hall of the Bulls, the Apse, and the Chamber of Felines&#x02014;to be a
more important key to understanding Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> than the
famous "Sc&#x000E8;ne du puits."
<p>
<a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>.
A third exigency faces Bataille: he must also strive to insert the visual
evidence of Lascaux into his prefabricated mythology of transgression;
that is why he later privileges the "Sc&#x000E8;ne du puits," emphasizing
what he takes to be its themes of sex and death. I am more interested
here in the moments when Bataille appears mesmerized by the chaotic
masses of superimposed res that do not submit so easily to thematic
recuperation. For a critique of Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> that neglects
the degree to which he develops a theory of superimposition independent
of his earlier&#x02014;and later&#x02014;work, see Jean Louis Schefer,
<i>Questions d'art pal&#x000E9;olithique</i> (Paris: P.O.L., 1999).

Bataille's avoidance of the term <i>graffiti</i> (or <i>graffite</i>)
is interesting in itself: at one point, when speaking of the "abside,"
Bataille quotes Breuil almost verbatim, but replaces Breuil's "graffite"
with the more dignified appellation, "gravures": "Cette salle est
l'une des plus curieuses de la caverne, mais elle ne pr&#x000E9;sente
&#x000E0; la vue qu'un fouillis de peintures en partie effac&#x000E9;es et

"Lascaux distances us from the art of backward peoples [<i>l'art des

us closer to the art of the most refined and effervescent civilizations"
(<i>L,</i> 80).
<p>
<a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>.
Bataille writes in <i>L'Art primitif</i>: "Art . . . proceeds
in this sense by successive destructions. Thus, insofar as art
liberates <i>libidinal</i> instincts, these instincts are sadistic"
(in <i>Documents,</i> 139; italics in original).

Georges-Henri Luquet, <i>L'Art et la religion des hommes fossiles</i>
(Paris: Masson, 1926), 134. In the case of the Aurignacians, Luquet
writes, the origin of representation must be sought "in the lines that
the author traced not with the intention of decorating or ring,
but simply in order to trace" . For an astute consideration (and
extension) of Luquet's views, see Whitney Davis, <i>Replications.</i>
Davis argues that the "digital flutings" on the walls of Gargas (the
same cave Luquet studied) provide a clue to the conditions out of which
image-making arose: "The tracing," Davis notes, "has internal rhythms of
its own. . . . In the flickering semidarkness, our visitor to the cave
may have momentarily mistaken some of the marks&#x02014;whether made by her
or by anyone else&#x02014;as animal forms, but they were not necessarily
representations of animals for just that reason. . . . she would already
learn that she could make the mark not just and only as a mark but also
as a mark that could be seen as an object. If and when she <i>remade</i>
that or that kind of mark for seeing-as&#x02014;knowing it was just a mark
but interested, now, in its object-resembling properties&#x02014;then she
made an image. Mark became remark. . . . But to reiterate, the very
first mark in this and the other replication sequences was not made
as an image but only as a mark" (39-40). Davis adds that the primary
impulse for mark-making might have had nothing whatsoever with the urge
to create depictions; marks are produced by human "scribbling or rhythmic
repetition" , and also by animal claws and paw prints .

It is odd to what a great extent Bataille's text echoes that of
his adversary, Henri B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n, who also grants much more
significance to the act of making the inscription than to its final
appearance. Presenting the very utilitarian thesis Bataille abhorred,
B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n writes in terms resembling Bataille's: "C'est que
'seule' l'ex&#x000E9;cution du dessin ou de la sculpture importait. La
repr&#x000E9;sentation de l'animal &#x000E9;tait un <i>acte</i> qui
valait par lui-m&#x000EA;me. Une fois que cet acte &#x000E9;tait accompli,
le r&#x000E9;sultat imm&#x000E9;diat et mat&#x000E9;riel de cet acte,
le dessin, n'avait plus aucune importance" ("Les Bases magiques," 211;
italics in original). B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n also bases his interpretation
on the phenomenon of superimposition . Despite his obvious influence,
I have found no reference to B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n in Bataille's works.
<p>
<a name="FOOT49" href="#REF49">49</a>.
It is tempting to apply Bataille's theory of superimposition as a
practice that reveals the kinetic basis of inscription (developed
with reference to cave markings) to an interpretation of his preferred
aesthetic objects. An interest in superimposition might have governed,
for instance, Bataille's choice of illustrations for the 1944 edition
of <i>Histoire de l'oeil</i>, a set of four drawings by Hans Bellmer in
which overlapping rations form their own sort of "embrouillamini."

Jay, who argues in <i>Downcast Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in
Twentieth-Century French Thought</i> (Berkeley: University of California
Press, 1993) that Bataille "mocked in advance Merleau-Ponty's benign
reembodiment of the eye in the 'flesh of the world'" . I explore

Lewis-Williams has asserted that "much Upper Paleolithic parietal
imagery was, in some measure, in some ways, shamanic," that it involved
"altered states of consciousness" that occur universally under particular
conditions. These states of trance induce what Lewis-Williams calls
"institutionalized hallucinations"; it is while participating in
one of these collective, ritualized trance states that human beings
execute <i>a set of repetitive gestures</i> leaving regular traces
upon walls. See David Lewis-Williams, "Harnessing the Brain: Vision and
Shamanism in Upper Paleolithic Western Europe," in <i>Beyond Art,</i>
322-4. See also Jean Clottes, <i>The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and
Magic in the Painted Caves,</i> trans. Sophie Hawkes (New York: Harry
N. Abrams, 1998). According to Clottes, vigorous dancing, chanting,
sensory deprivation, and prolonged social isolation may produce the
trance state consistent with the <i>homo sapiens sapiens</i> nervous
system . During this trance state geometric forms (grids, parallel
lines) appear and are projected onto the surface of the cave ; these
forms provide the first support for later rations, which are also
projected hallucinations, or memories of hallucinations, incited during
trance. The shaman theory, which combines ethnographic comparison and
close observation of individual caves, helps to explain: 1) the lack of
composition ("animals are, for the most part, unrelated to each other"
[92]); 2) the use of suggestive surfaces ("Touching may have led to the
creation of images" [86]); and 3) the phenomenon of superimposition,
which Clottes discusses with reference to the Apse ("abside") at Lascaux
(109-10).
