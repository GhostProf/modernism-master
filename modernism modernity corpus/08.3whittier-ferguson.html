<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is an unlikely title for a history of art, and yet, if we had read
it when and where it first appeared, in England, in mid-June of 1940,
in a little volume by Gertrude Stein called <I>Paris France,</I> we
would perhaps have given it our grim approval.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Paris had just fallen to the Germans, who now occupied virtually all of
  Northern and Central Europe. A couple of weeks earlier, a quarter of a
  million British soldiers had been evacuated from Dunkirk, and Germany's
  designs on England were obvious. German militarism and the ambitions
  of its leaders had done much to twist the century into its misshapen,
  modern form. We could have agreed that "From Bismark to Hitler" was an
  apt title for a great many books--even those concerning subjects that
  writers of an earlier era might not have thought belonged under the
  aegis of a chancellor. Nevertheless, we should pause over the deliberate
  and forceful incongruity of Stein's wry suggestion. Particularly
  coming from this writer who had lived so fully, for so much of her
  life, in contemptuous disregard of explicitly political matters and
  the business of governments, who openly maintained her scorn for the
  "gross t&ecirc;tes," the "big heads [who] are ambitious that is the
  reason they are big heads and so they are at the head of the government
  and the result is misery for the people,"  the idea that Bismarck and
  Hitler might preside, not only over millions of people, but over her
  discussion of art, seems to constitute a terrible concession by Stein
  of her aesthetic domain (<I>PF,</I> 28).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But over the course of her life, Stein comes to understand how the
story of art is also the story of armies, how accounts of artists and
"gross t&ecirc;tes" belong together on the same vexed page. She spends
the last years of her life living in wartime, musing on the causes and
effects and experience of war, and working war into her art and her
theories about art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  I focus in this essay on three selections from her extensive writings
  about the second world war of her lifetime, conscious all the while
  that leaving any of Stein's war writings out of my discussion means that
  I have not addressed the full complexity of her response to that war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  My selections, nevertheless, are <I>Paris France,</I> written before
  the German invasion of her adopted country, and two pieces she wrote
  after the defeat of Germany: an essay for <I>Life</I> magazine titled
  "Off We All Went to See Germany" , and her final composition,
  published posthumously in the <I>Yale Poetry Review,</I> "Reflection on
  the Atomic Bomb" . Although the works are written for different
  audiences, and although they bracket the war's beginning and ending,
  they all display Stein's understanding of war as an especially vehement
  and large-scale manifestation of difference. Literally, of course,
  those differences are geopolitical and military, and they occur between
  and within nations. But when Stein writes about war, other differences
  become crucial as well--between private and public spheres, between
  past and present, between childhood and adulthood, between her own
  and others' points of view. Words themselves take on different meanings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I frame my discussion of Stein's World War II writing by first looking
briefly at concepts she develops before that second war, in texts
written during the 1920s and 1930s. The peculiar view of World War II
through Stein's eyes cannot be understood without first understanding her
often anguished meditations--composed for the most part following the
publication of <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I> in 1933--on
audience and intimacy, on self-possession and the self dispersed,
on writing with and without reference, on being read by a necessarily
alien public as well as by the few who know her. Insofar as Stein's
war writings have received attention at all (and that attention has,
with a few exceptions, only begun within the past few years), this late
work has been insufficiently linked to her earlier texts. There has also
been an understandable tendency to read Stein's war work in terms that,
while of great importance, are ultimately limiting. Recent discussions
of Stein in France have rested on attempts to decide and evaluate what
political position (or positions) she held during the war. Readers
in our own time generally want first to determine which side she took
(or why she refused to take sides), and how extensively she benefited
from the protection of the Vichy government. They ask whether aspects
of her own theory and artistic practice can be said to carry political
meaning. And how fully does she reflect the continually shifting attitudes
of the French themselves--as collaborators, resistors, and the majority
of those who stood equivocally somewhere in between?
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  I by no means want to foreclose reading Stein's wartime writing as
  part of an important contemporary exploration of the problems of
  allegiance in occupied France, but I want also to expand the terms of
  the discussion of these texts beyond specific, historical questions
  of collaboration. For Stein, the phenomenon of war is a manifestation
  and crucial cause of the excitements and horrors of modernity. These
  excitements and horrors are as much

<B></B>

aesthetic and ontological as they are sociopolitical and military. And
in her intimate conjoining of the realms of war and art, Stein displays
her modernity every bit as fully as she does in her gnostic, avant-garde
writings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
War emerges with startling centrality in "Composition as
Explanation"--Stein's lecture delivered in 1926 to undergraduates
at Oxford and Cambridge. There is little in Stein's preceding work,
or in immediate, contemporary circumstances to explain the pivotal
presence of war in this speech. Ulla Dydo suggests that Stein makes her
analogy between aesthetic and martial innovation in an effort to close
"a generation gap between her audience and herself," but I do not find
this explanation convincing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  It is more plausible to understand the introduction of the Great War
  not as a bid for the attention of the young so much as a carefully
  thought-out explanation for the shape of society and the domain of
  art in the years after 1919. For Stein, modernity and the war that
  brings the twentieth century wholly into "the modern composition"
  derives from conflict, when a peaceful, homogeneous state is broken by
  the introduction of something different: "Everything alike naturally
  everything was simply different and this is and was romanticism
  and this is and was war" ("CE," 501). "Romanticism," in addition
  to referring somewhat loosely to early-nineteenth-century English
  poetry, names the fact of division, the introduction of difference
  into any system--aesthetic, political, psychological. It is important
  to understand that she connects these systems. The writer who would
  name her art history "From Bismark to Hitler" is the writer who insists
  that changes in one sphere mean changes in others.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Her <I>Lectures in America</I> will show Stein developing at great length
a geographical history--the phrase is hers--that ties the characteristics
of a nation's art closely to the exposure of that nation to difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  In her explanatory narrative, most extensively laid out in the
  lecture titled "What is English Literature," England grows less
  and less self-contained as time progresses, beginning to enter its
  modern state of being with the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars. By
  1815, "England" no longer designates an island and the comparatively
  homogeneous group of people living within that island's limited bounds
  but points instead, disconcertingly, to an empire either being built,
  or maintained, or falling apart far beyond the island's shores. English
  writing consequently suffers, because it now needs to answer to so
  many different demands.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Stein is nominally an American, and she tours her native country
with a lecture on the problems of English literature in part so that
she can offer to her audiences the answer to modernity provided
by their own writers, their own culture. Since America is not an
island and since, in Stein's telling of history, it is not a country
engaged in the exhausting, impossible labor of maintaining an empire,
it has never had to deal with the traumatic violation of inside by
outside. Immigration leads to incorporation; it does not result in a
nation divided against itself. Clearly, Stein is telling her lettered
audience of students, patrons of art, intellectuals, and members of the
social elite a comforting story about unity across classes and cultures
at a time still cast in the shadow of the Great Depression in a country
ferociously divided by difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Her description of America as having been always and fundamentally
  alone, disconnected from the rest of the world, also suits the
  isolationist temper of the decade.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Here is a nation

<B></B>

that cannot but be uninvolved in the world's increasingly troubling
affairs. And for Stein herself, whose anxieties surrounding exposure
and connectedness to a general public are so powerful as to bring her
writing career to a crisis following the widespread success of <I>The
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  a claim of her American heritage stands as a bid for remaining
  unassailably beyond everything:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the disembodied way of disconnecting something from anything and anything
from something was the American one. . . . Some say that it is repression
but no it is not repression it is a lack of connection, of there being
no connection with living and daily living because there is none, that
makes American writing what it always has been and what it will continue
to become.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ironically, of course, the very fact that Stein gives this talk and the
other five that she assembles under the heading <I>Lectures in America</I>
to audiences nationwide--audiences that subject her to nonstop, if
largely adoring scrutiny during her tour--demonstrates how extensively
she is connected to her public. Her overwhelming interest in the issues
attending embodiment makes perfect sense. Her second autobiography,
<I>Everybody's Autobiography</I> , centrally concerned with
"What Happened After <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I>"
(the title of the book's opening chapter) and with the American tour,
reveals on virtually every page Stein's sense of exposure, particularly
as she traveled in her native land.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  She remains always on display, in texts that can be read and reread
  by strangers, and in her own person as she stands before those
  strangers. The fact and conditions of her lecture tour create a
  principal subject for those lectures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We cannot forget, further, that Stein lives in France rather than England
or America--on the European continent, not on an island or a landmass
effectively protected by oceans. If we return to her discussion of war
and modernity in "Composition as Explanation," we realize that, far from
living composed in an "American" state of removal from connections of
all kinds, Stein has experienced most of this century in what she calls
her "romantic" country rather than the one where she "belongs"--center
stage in the theater of world war--and war remains the most appallingly
powerful means by which difference is made violently manifest on a large
scale (<I>PF,</I> 2). The "romanticism" of 1914-8 has brought her
brutally into modernity. There is much in "Composition as Explanation"
that might be read simply as aesthetic theory, but we can feel the sharp
edge of Stein's satirical characterization of her century as she describes
how war dragged millions of people to an unarguably modern state:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And so there was the natural phenomenon that was war . . . [which itself]
became completely contemporary and so created the completed recognition
of the contemporary composition. Every one but one may say every one
became consciously became aware of the existence of the authenticity of
the modern composition. . . . And so war may be said to have advanced
a general recognition of the expression of the contemporary composition
by almost thirty years. ["CE," 501]

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein utters these sentences to men of ting age, in a community
decimated by the Great War, in a climate filled with the most scathing
reflections on the pointlessness of the global conflict of a decade
earlier, started and scandalously mismanaged by old men from another era
altogether. We recognize here the same dark wit that would lodge Bismark
and Hitler in the title of a book on art. What has been "advanced" to
"every one"--notice the understated comedy of the emphasis Stein places on
"every one" ("but one may say every one")--is the violent understanding of
difference as it manifests itself in invasion, attack, conflict ending
in death, the redrawing of maps, cultural and political revolution,
and social and aesthetic change of unparalleled rapidity and scope.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The painful challenge that wartime conditions force on Stein is in
important respects a challenge that she has been struggling with ever
since the publication of <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.</I> Does
she choose to stand before an audience, uttering explanations and opinions
and answers, exposing herself to queries, engaging in conversations,
using language primarily as an instrument for communication? Or does
she refuse to debase her medium and to violate her privacy, writing
instead purely with the aim of putting words in lively combinations on
the page, purging her mind--and, ideally, the minds of her readers--of
thoughts about what these words mean, whether they make a story, how
they relate to our ordinary world? She pursues both courses, often in
dizzying alternations on a single page. And the stakes attending this
double choice are extraordinarily high. By the summer of 1940, invasion
and occupation are no longer only psychologically inflected res for
the experiences of writing and being read. Outside breaks in; Germany
overruns France. Although Stein continues to believe that her highest
calling is the writing she does without reference to daily living, from
1939 through 1945 she works under the inevitable pressures placed upon
a writer to respond to the threat and then the actuality of invasion and
the newly importunate facts of daily existence that follow. She now feels
compelled to bear some kind of witness, to tell her story about the war
she sees, and to satisfy an American public--brought largely into being
by <I>The Autobiography</I>--with accounts of life in occupied France.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's vacillation between reference and antireferential writing
constitutes one of her idiosyncratic strengths as a writer about war,
even as it leaves her vulnerable to charges of carelessness in the face
of urgent, demonstrable human suffering.  All of her texts written during
World War II are marked by an aesthetically, morally, and emotionally
volatile instability. Examples are everywhere; I offer one from <I>Paris
France</I>:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

I like words of one syllable, and it works out very well in the French
order for general mobilization. The printed thing gives all the detail
and then it says the army de terre, de mer et de l'air. That is very
impressive when you read it in every village.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It "works out very well" if one reads this proclamation of nationwide
conscription purely as a collection of words on a government notice
(and if the reader is not a man of conscriptable age). Here, as is so
often the case, Stein courts furious accusations from

<B></B>

readers who are more directly caught up either in the machinery of war
itself or who will resent as unpatriotic this aesthetic attention to
words instead of a more direct embrace of their stirring reference to
battle. She sustains criticism from both groups throughout the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  But she deliberately refuses to be "mobilized" herself by the
  government's martial rhetoric. She maintains a skepticism about the act
  of making war and the ways language can be used to promote war. She
  recognizes facts about life in wartime that an ardent defender of
  any particular side or cause might not see or might not allow him or
  herself to register in writing. Her careful observation of the details
  of life in occupied France constitutes an unusual and important act
  of witnessing, without the obtrusive presence of the author guiding us
  through an illustrated argument. As she stares at this "printed thing,"
  she is not attempting to explain, shape opinion, appeal to familiar
  systems of ethics, influence political or military choices. In this
  particular form of disengagement, her work is unusual among war memoirs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's body of work on the war matters in part because it explores, in
the most unpropitious circumstances imaginable, a late and especially
explicit iteration of a modernist aesthetic dream: the creation in
language, by an author who has effectively vanished--inviolate behind the
words on the page--of a system of relations that does not tell a story,
of words moving but never falling into narrative and never, therefore,
pulling us into the human, all-too-human world where cause and effect
brings with it responsibility and anxiety and hope and, ultimately, mortal
ends. Stein's war writing also matters for the opposite but profoundly
allied reason that we can discover on her pages powerfully realized
portraits of life in wartime. And the final irony pertaining to Stein's
divided aims and her writing that is often so utterly at odds with itself
lies in the fact that every writer's attempt to narrate purposefully
experience during war founders as it confronts events that cannot be told,
experiences that refuse grammatical parsing and the shapes of narration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Her reasons for joining this numerous company of necessary failures
  are idiosyncratic in the extreme. And yet there on her pages are the
  rhetorical effects she regularly achieves in her misshapen, interrupted,
  jarringly framed and therefore deeply expressive sentences about World
  War II.

Peace and Quiet on the Western Front: Paris France and the Phony War
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Written in the bizarre months of late 1939 and early 1940, during which
her adopted country declares war in September and then waits for an
attack that does not come until the following May, <I>Paris France</I>
stands in many respects as the war book of Stein's that captures the
most recognizably widespread sense of the times in France.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Once France falls to the Germans, Stein's perspective on events
  grows increasingly personal, though it remains accurate to the
  peculiar experience of life for the French after armistice, under
  occupation. Following the Allies' declaration of war against Germany
  on 3 September, the fall and winter in both England and France--a
  period journalists soon named "the phony war"--was marked by a surreal
  combination of normalcy and frantic preparations for battle. Expecting
  immediate German air raids, both countries placed themselves under
  blackout, pursued plans for evacuations of women and children

<B></B>

from major cities, restricted civilian movement and issued gas masks. They
changed radio programming to music interrupted only by occasional
announcements, set up home defense squadrons, had city inhabitants digging
trenches for shelter, and made numerous other provisions for self-defense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  But the expected attack failed to materialize and restrictions
  relaxed. Life shifted, as the fall progressed, to a strange mixture of
  waiting in anxious preparedness and resuming something like ordinary
  daily living. Though a great many sentences of <I>Paris France</I> take
  an ironic inflection and can even seem grotesquely off the mark when
  the book is read after its publication date in June of 1940--the Nazis
  having entered Paris on the fourteenth of June--Stein writes her book
  when France is living in this indeterminate time before the arrival of
  the Germans. War is a fact, but it has not yet fully arrived. Poland
  falls by October, Finland ts the Soviets through the winter, the
  German army invades Denmark and Norway in April, but France remains
  untouched. "Paris, France," she tells us in her first sentence, "is
  exciting and peaceful" (<I>PF,</I> 1). Ever since <I>Three Lives,</I>
  Stein has been composing sentences around the copula that splinter when
  we arrive at their predicates. Briefly, now, she is just describing
  the way things are. She has spent much of her writing life considering
  how often a single subject comprises contradictory states of being,
  reflecting on the plural and uncertain ways we occupy any temporally
  located moment. She proves astonishingly well prepared to describe
  the limbo of the phony war as many lived it in France.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The country that takes shape on the pages of <I>Paris France</I> seems
virtually immune to the motions of time. Stein writes to assure herself
and her readers that little has happened or can ever happen in this place,
as though she were performing a comforting stroll through an undamaged
garden between dramatic but ultimately inconsequential storms. Hers
is a pre-industrial, agrarian France that follows rhythms too deeply
ingrained to be affected by mere politics or the martial doings of
certain men. "[W]hat is was and what was is," she insists: "the season
and fashions that exist with the seasons are the things France lives
by, the earth has its seasons and the people who live on that earth
have fashions and that is all" (<I>PF,</I> 24, 28-9). Imbued with
the rhythms of Ecclesiastes, Stein's sentences inflexibly connect the
French with the earth and with the least instrumental, least necessary
human pursuit imaginable: fashion. French people in this book are either
absorbed in attending to their most basic physical requirements--procuring
food, clothing, and shelter--or they are deliberately preoccupied by the
most frivolous concerns--the design of hats, say, or the ways of their
dogs. Fashion, the behavior of animals, and the needs of the body matter
enormously to Stein and to the French because these things are still
disconnected from the emergencies of the time (though this disconnection
will not be sustainable once the invasion begins). "Poetry makes nothing
happen," Auden wrote in February of this same year
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 --a time when the laws of cause and effect themselves at times seem
 weirdly suspended--and Stein celebrates a disengagement that has long
 been considered the province of the aesthetic: "Now all these dogs being
 of no use can be made fashionable, because fashion must never be useful,
 must very often be exotic, and must always be made to be french. That
 is what fashion is and it must change" (<I>PF,</I> 35). For the first
 half of

<B></B>

<I>Paris France,</I> fashion seems to be the only thing that changes--or
the only change that is worth noticing. When those changes come,
furthermore, they arise essentially without agency. Like all of the
productions of genius in Stein's scheme of the world's operations,
fashions cannot properly be attributed to conscious design.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  They happen almost by accident, as natural phenomena occur, regular as
  the seasons--predictable, mildly surprising in their minute variations,
  and consoling: "And so there is no use going on, except that the
  summers follow one after the other and the fashions go with the
  seasons" (<I>PF,</I> 28). "Fashion" comes to mean a great deal more,
  too, than the way clothes hang on a body. Stein increases the domain
  of fashion, of perceived form, so radically in <I>Paris France</I>
  that wars themselves somehow seem like hemlines or the cut of a man's
  jacket--cyclically linked, following a design, echoing one another
  in a way that brings a dark kind of comfort to the stolid, stoical
  French. The fall days of 1939 are shadowed by those of 1914. Resigned,
  the French find pattern, not progress, repetition rather than evolution:
  "And now it is once more an August and September and there is once more
  a crisis and once more the farmers the gentle farmers talk about life
  as it is" (<I>PF,</I> 27). This is a land that cannot be understood in
  historical terms. It is instead a place of the perpetual present tense:
  "And so France cannot change it can always have its fashions but it
  cannot change" (<I>PF,</I> 33).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But a realm locked this completely into timelessness can become difficult
to distinguish from a land of the dead. <I>Paris France</I> is haunted
by death, which exists as an imminent possibility and an immanent fact
of life in wartime. French life exhibits much of the changelessness of a
work of art or, more particularly, a monument. Its people move as though
choreographed, caught in the earth's ritual embrace. We find ourselves
pondering a country that has already lost the war because resisting
seems beside the point. France has resigned itself to invasion, given
itself over to a life that exhibits few vital signs:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And then the way they feel about the dead, it is so friendly so simply
friendly and though inevitable not a sadness and though occurring not a
shock. There is no difference between death and life in France and that
too made it inevitable that they were the background of the twentieth
century. [<I>PF</I>, 13]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this eternally ancient nation from which the twentieth century grows,
among the fatalistic citizens who will pass mildly away, children become
the locus for Stein's characterization of the costs and the effects of
war. When <I>Paris France</I> shifts from descriptions of the country
and its place in history to an attempt to address the experience of
wartime more directly, Stein turns our attention to a little girl who
lives near her in the village of Bilignin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  She makes the shift to childhood for several reasons. Her understanding
  of space and time has long deliberately retained something of the
  flexibility, the synchronicity of a child's.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  Those who live in the state of temporal suspension that characterizes
  late 1939 and early 1940 in France live to some degree outside of time's
  ordinary progress, as children do. They seem to be equally helpless,
  as well, unable to control whatever is about to happen. This village
  girl also allows Stein to examine her

<B></B>

own earlier days as a writer. Using the girl's name as a trigger for her
backward glance, Stein returns, in a textual representation of memory,
to a prior form of art--what has become, by 1939, one of her most famous
instances of avant-garde, noninstrumental writing--now measured against
words differently employed. One of Stein's strategies for assessing the
meaning of the coming of war is to see what happens when a word slips
from a wholly linguistic field of play into a time, a place, a body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The word is "Button." It has gone from part of a title--<I>Tender
Buttons</I>--to a girl's last name: Helen Button. But before we listen to
Helen's wartime experience, we must first recall the sketch that famously
opens <I>Tender Buttons,</I> under the heading "Objects." Stein presents
us with the portrait of an object that is comparatively impervious
to time:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tensions between the familiar and the strange in this passage will
return to haunt Helen Button. Even the ordinary attributes of this
carafe have turned unsettling: the adjective "blind" disconcertingly
suggests the possibility of the object becoming a subject capable of
returning our scrutiny, just as "hurt" may point ratively to color
but gestures also toward a body. Though this object is "not unordered
in not resembling," though it has discernible form, is an "arrangement
in a system to pointing," we are not initiated into the design of that
system, the category in which its lack of resemblance would seem merely
another instance of order. Different from expectations, familiar as kin
and cousin might seem, but also, if looked at again or awry, less than
kind, less known than novel, this carafe is a spectacle whose hard-edged
indeterminacies threaten to overwhelm the observer and the observer's
methods for making sense: "The difference is spreading."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we watch Helen Button staring at a kindred object in <I>Paris
France</I>--as though she were looking at one of the items from <I>Tender
Buttons</I> transposed, twenty-five years later, on the eve of the next
war, to a village in Southeastern France--we witness her transformation
from a little girl to a character in a story by Stein: "We have had here
in the village a little girl and her name is H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bouton,
Helen Button" (<I>PF,</I> 80).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bouton's imperfect reflection in Helen Button
  signals the difference between life and narrative and inaugurates
  a double act of recollection--of a French girl and of a highly
  charged English word from Stein's prior text that shares Helen's last
  name. Stein undertakes the complex act of recollection emphasizing that
  all portraits should take the measure of and unfold self-consciously in
  time, particularly when time carries such heavy freight: "because after
  all this war is not war," she adds in her opening, "it is war-time"
  (<I>PF,</I> 80). This war is "not war" because it has commenced without
  fully, violently beginning in earnest for the French. All of Stein's
  writings about war will explore the myriad ways in which the state of
  wartime itself can at once seem

<B></B>

all-encompassing and wholly irrelevant to anyone living during war. Every
sentence in her work that measures the full effect of living under war's
terrible dispensations is followed shortly by a companion sentence that
shows the subject virtually untouched by circumstances we associate with
conflict. And not only does Stein underscore her subject's divided modes
of being in time. She also encourages us to look beyond particulars, so
that the local H&eacute;l&egrave;ne becomes the more general, more textual
Helen, who lives not simply in late 1939 but in a widespread historical
condition we call "war-time," stretching back even to the <I>Iliad,</I>
where we will also find this girl's name. "She lived somewhere," Stein
impatiently assures us, knowing that we will naturally gravitate toward
the pathos of a specific case history and thereby be likely to miss the
even more sobering truth that there are millions of Helens existing
in time and space, their fates echoing across the centuries like the
ticking of a clock. "[B]ut the thing that is important is that she
lived during war-time. There is a great deal of war-time in history
and Helen Button lived in it" (<I>PF,</I> 81). Stein introduces her
portrait as a story about "what a child's feeling about war-time is"
(<I>PF,</I> 80). Helen Button, we find, has spent many of her days and
nights anxiously immersed in history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's story of Helen occupies ten enormously complex pages of <I>Paris
France,</I> and yet it is with the first, deliberately framed narration
of an event in Helen Button's life that her last name and the event
together recall <I>Tender Buttons.</I> Stein now restages the opening
of her earlier work, providing us with an object and a perceiving subject:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Helen Button started out with her dog William. As they were walking along
 suddenly William stopped and was very nervous. He saw something on the
 road and so did Helen. They neither of them knew what it was at first
 and at last as they approached very carefully they saw it was a bottle,
 a bottle standing up right in the middle of the road. There had been
 something in the bottle but what, it looked dark green or may be blue
 or black, and the bottle was standing up in the middle of the road,
 not lying on its side the way a bottle on the road usually is.
<BR>
William the dog and Helen the little girl went on. They did not look
 back at the bottle. But of course it was still there because they had
 not touched it.
<BR>
That is war-time. [<I>PF,</I> 82]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage resists reading as forcefully as did its antecedent in
<I>Tender Buttons</I>. And this kindred moment is explicitly concerned
with the effects of that resistance on two emblematical interpreters who
share nervousness though their differences from each other extend even to
their species. The familiar open vista of the road suddenly contracts
around an object needing to be deciphered, threatening in its pure
opacity. That mere object, the bottle of indeterminate color, demands
interpretation because Helen and William are searching for what Stein,
three paragraphs earlier, has called "signs" that will orient them in
their ominously unfolding presents. The somehow crucial difference--that
this bottle stands up rather than lying on its side--seems fraught with
meaning in part because there is so little to interpret, so little to
hold on to in this scene that epitomizes Helen and William's continually
menacing, largely uneventful lives in wartime.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difference, too, between this nonincident and "A CARAFE THAT IS
A BLIND GLASS" augments its already considerable power. When Stein's
object returns on this road, changed but related to a precedent object in
<I>Tender Buttons,</I> and when we watch this girl and her dog equally
though differently afraid of its possible significance, we confront
a representative anxiety about failing to make meaning. Circumstances
demand interpretation but leave us with insufficient points of reference
by which we might venture to make sense of things. <I>Tender Buttons</I>
does not stand as a key in relation to this later scene; the echoes
do not help us read this different world. Our own acts of recollection
simplify nothing. Brooding over history is as existentially mystifying
to Stein as is being in the present, but those twin mystifications are
most upsetting and most obvious during war. The comforting appositives,
"the dog" and "the little girl" try, with only partial success, to
reassemble William and Helen after their misadventure. But the bottle,
Stein carefully insists, opening a space in her narrative for memory's
continued, hysterical workings, "was still there because they had not
touched it." Helen and William do not look over their shoulders, but the
narrative glances back, forcing us to acknowledge that the impervious
object remains to be recalled. Being in wartime exacerbates the tendency
for the subject to fall into a seemingly infinite variety of disorders,
leaving the inner and outer interpretable worlds incoherent, filled
only with difference and unspeakable absences. The faculty of memory
allows (or is <I>condemns</I> a better word?) the repeated return to
these moments of difference, just as this brief scene circles back on
itself. Stein's sketch of the displaced Helen and William holds out to
them and to her readers the possibility, at once terrible and promising,
of recollection. Not looking at the bottle but seeing it all the same,
they know that there is something--a world--still there "because they
had not touched it."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the story of Helen Button in wartime continues, Stein displays, in the
compressed narrative of her character's life, experiences and patterns
of thought that will characterize her subsequent writing about the
war. Helen's is a world where no relation--between people, with animals,
with objects themselves, and even with the ostensible enemy--can be relied
upon; where the urge to embrace prophecies, or hold to any system of signs
that will allow the comforting sense that the future is foreknown and
follows a plan is continually offset by even the most ordinary, expected
events going wrong; where the laws of cause and effect seem suspended;
where the familiar turns horrific and the anticipated nightmare does
not materialize. Helen watches her friend Emil's dog, Ellen, "changing
and her fur turned into large baggy trousers and her head turned into
a large shaggy head and it was a man, an enemy man" (<I>PF,</I> 86).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  She clings to her Aunt Pauline, who knows what the future holds--an
  extremely consequential gift of sight in these days, since "in
  war-time anything might happen so it was very necessary to know it"
  (<I>PF,</I> 87).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  When the unexpected does occur (Aunt Pauline's lucidity has no
  observable effect on this story), consequences remain puzzling. Helen's
  dog is hit by a car: "The automobile came on, it went over William
  and Helen screamed and William was down and then he was up and then
  away he went, oh how he did go" (<I>PF,</I> 89). Shortly after this
  misadventure, a wagon comes by, carrying an unidentified "animal":
  "nobody had ever seen any animal like it before, it was enormous

<B></B>

and it was dead. . . . The enormous animal did not have a tail and it did
not have any ears. It was an enormous animal and it was war-time. Helen
did not really see it but she told herself about it" (<I>PF,</I>
89-90). The last event in the story of Helen Button's life is,
fittingly, her encounter with the enemy. Modernity and life within "the
modern composition," to use Stein's phrase, means living exiled from
the quiet confines of an imagined and secure self, without an island
haven, lacking words alone. To be modern is to be forced, perhaps as one
writes for a general public or gives lectures before anonymous audiences,
often by the frightfully effective mechanism of war, into contact with
the irreducible mystery of others. It is to live always in the state of
wondering "who goes there?" Helen and Emil, her French friend with the
German name, see a young man on a nearby hill with a spy glass. They
decide on a patriotic course of action:

She grieves for herself and her precarious condition, for the vacuity
of a crowded world. She knows that looking back will no more resolve
the question of this stranger's allegiance than it will establish the
meaning of the bottle in the road, and that going away makes as much
sense as any other choice she and Emil might have taken, though it
accomplishes nothing. She is still young, and the war continues, but she
now understands all that can be known of her condition, "So for her,"
Stein explains, "war-time was over" (<I>PF</I>, 92). In the same bleak
but resolved frame of mind, Stein casts a glance back over what she has
just written and concludes, "So this is the twentieth century" (ibid.).

One of the most terrible aspects of Stein's portrait of Helen Button
is that the girl vanishes in tears from Stein's narrative, never to
reappear. Triumph over the enemy does not form part of her story. Stein,
on the other hand, experiences the complex euphoria of liberation. I
turn now to two pieces she wrote after V-E Day, one describing a trip
she takes to Germany with the United States Army, the other containing
her thoughts about the atomic bomb. Jean Gallagher who, in <I>The World
Wars Through the Female Gaze,</I> discusses a number of Stein's World
War II writings, argues that, "In

<B></B>

Stein's postliberation writing, not only do we see a marked turn toward
more detailed visual description and a willingness to interpret visual
data for readers, but we also see how Stein participates in a militarized
gaze."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  It is certainly true that Stein's <I>Wars I Have Seen</I> records the
  coming of the Americans in greatest detail and vehemently celebrates
  the Allied victory. I do not agree, however, that she allows herself
  to see more clearly or with increased specificity--in this text or
  in others written in 1945-6--than she did before the arrival
  of her countrymen. Nor, I think, does Stein consistently write
  with an interpretive certainty she lacked before the defeat of the
  Germans. Rather, I suggest, the United States press catches her up
  in its representations for the American public of the liberation of
  France. Her writing about the war and her attitude toward the coming of
  the Americans make national news. So powerful are the public narratives
  of victory, and so compelling is the story of this artist's liberation,
  that Stein finds herself speaking (and being quoted) in public venues
  that discourage ambiguity, even though she herself continues to
  interrogate the war and its legacies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  The war correspondents, Eric Sevareid and Frank Gervasi, report Stein's
  "liberation" to the American press; stories about her are carried in
  many American periodicals; Stein herself makes a broadcast to America.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  Coming out of her necessary retreat in the French countryside during
  the war, Stein is thrust back into the public eye as fully as she was
  after the <I>Autobiography</I> was published. And she measures that
  publicity and the consequences of victory every bit as thoughtfully
  as she weighed the success and the effects of her own prose in the
  mid-1930s. She lives now, at the end of the European war, in a time of
  resolutions, when so many are busily providing answers and explanations
  and retrospective interpretations. Her own project in this last year
  of the war becomes a questioning of conclusions. What she demonstrates
  again, in this next phase of her writing about the war, is her ability
  to capture the essential oddity of war and its aftermath. Few writers
  can speak with such peculiar authority about the surreal in the ordinary
  and the ordinary in what we thought was apocalyptic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's most explicit return to her mass audience occurs in her appearance
as an official witness of the Allied victory before the readers of
<I>Life</I> magazine in August of 1945.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  She begins her essay, "'Off We All Went to See Germany,'" with the
  insistent invitation of a corporal:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is a great deal of humor in this essay, and it is humor of a kind
that is likely to meet with the approval of Stein's American readers:
"But Bob, I said, I don't like Germans, I saw enough of them in France
I don't want to see them at home" (ibid.). She assures us, by the end
of the first paragraph, that we need not be concerned that we will hear
too much about Hitler's defeated nation: "And I really pretty well forgot

<B></B>

about Germany and the Germans in the enormous pleasure of living
intimately with the American Army" (<I>Life</I>, 54). The essay already
begins to complicate its ostensible purpose. This will be a visit to
see Germany in which not many Germans and not much of the country needs
to be seen. She reduces that country to a nonentity in prose that is
startling in its simplicity, as innocent of martial fervor or vengeful
pleasures as the musings of Helen Button or her friend Emil. The editors
of <I>Life</I> smile at her throughout, adding a section heading,
for example, to her observations about the effects of Allied bombs on
Cologne. "Roofs are important, yes," the editor of Stein's essay agrees
with Stein, in pleased condescension at her own description:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Cologne was the most destroyed city we had seen yet, it is natural, of
course it is natural to speak of one's roof, roofs are in a way the most

it looked very fragile as if you pushed it hard with your finger your
finger either would go through it or it would fall over. [<I>Life</I>, 56]

But Stein maintains her own integrity, her distinction from the
editorial point of view, simply by recording her observations in her own
style--a style that continues to demonstrate how tentative is the act of
witnessing, how little we can harvest from our gleaning of the world. With
the victory of the Allies comes an endless string of documentary accounts
and photographs and films that promise to bring us closer to the facts of
the war in Europe. Stein is a cautious, canny member of this documentary
assembly. The photograph that introduces her article weirdly illustrates
the questions, at once visual and ethical, raised by much of her writing
about the war (<A HREF="8.3whittier-ferguson_1.html"> 1</A>). How
much does this witness see? How much does she know about the surrounding
world, and how fully does she respond to that world? Stein and Toklas
"see the Rhine," the picture's caption assures us, but due to an
accident of lighting, we see not the view from a window but a framed,
black square. The image provides an unsettling introduction to a piece
built around observations of a foreign country. In a furious response to
the predominantly unperturbed tone of <I>Wars I Have Seen,</I> a reviewer
in <I>The New York Times</I> wonders, "Didn't Miss Stein ever see the
harried, beaten, ragged refugees in Paris from 1933 on? . . . Where are
Miss Stein's eyes, those eyes that can so unerringly discern the value
of a Picasso?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  It is precisely these canny aesthete's eyes, however, through which
  <I>Life</I> proposes we glimpse Germany. Reinforcing in the strongest
  imaginable terms a divide between the terrifying world of men in
  destructive action and these two older women who have given their
  lives to art and to a sheltered, somewhat unorthodox but fundamentally
  bourgeois domesticity, this article presents us with a deliberate
  respite from anguished journalism. In its place we are given a small
  collection of impressions and disarmingly direct commentary on the
  causes of and antidotes to war from one of the very first postwar
  tourists in Germany. Stein herself comes to understand her unique status
  shortly after her arrival in Frankfurt, as she discovers the Germans
  looking not at the American soldiers but at "Miss Toklas and myself":

In an eerie, war-inflected reprise of her return to Oakland in April
1935, when she found "no there there," the central purpose of Stein's

personalities, to see only surfaces and hollow shells of bombed-out
buildings, to take a tour, yes, but to find virtually nothing on the trip.

Modris Eksteins has recently published an essay on war tourism, focusing
primarily on tour guides and accounts of travel after the First World
War. Eksteins documents the phenomenon of postwar tourists and tour
promoters, arguing that "the sight of civilization in ruin produces
. . . an interesting mix of piety and titillation, of rumination and
excitement."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Stein's quick trip to Germany cannot offer such sublime and

<B></B>

suspect emotional satisfactions, since she finds little in the faculty of
memory worth attending to--of what use, then, would ruins be? Whatever
titillating horror this journey does have to offer must come when Stein
reaches her journey's destination--Hitler's mountain retreat in the
Alpine town of Berchtesgaden.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  The photograph of her in this spot comes at the close of the <I>Life</I>
  essay (<A HREF="8.3whittier-ferguson_2.html"> 2</A>). To
  understand this photograph and the account Stein gives of the occasion
  it commemorates, we should remember that, in 1945, there were a number
  of senior Allied officers and intelligence staff who feared that Hitler
  and his remaining followers would make a last, bloody stand in the
  "Mountain Redout" of Berchtesgaden. The town and Hitler's sanctuary
  had become saturated, in the imaginations of soldiers and civilians,
  with the horrors of the Third Reich.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is the aura of this place that allows Stein her metonymic description
of the next stage of her journey: "off we went to Hitler" (<I>Life,</I>
57). But those five words, which ring with the declarative simplicity of
a nightmare, introduce us instead to the most surprising scene of whimsy:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
there we were in that big window where Hitler dominated the world a bunch
of GIs just gay and happy. It really was the first time I saw our boys
really gay and careless, really forgetting their burdens and just being
foolish kids, climbing up and around and on top, while Miss Toklas and
I sat comfortably and at home on garden chairs on Hitler's balcony. It
was funny it was completely funny, it was more than funny it was absurd
and yet so natural. [Ibid.]

<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's long-famous simplicity of diction now serves as a measure of
the Allied victory. So completely has Hitler been defeated that where
he once ruled soldiers can become children again, and aging women
find ordinary comfort. The prepositions, "up and around and on top,"
speak of liberation and the license to be in places formerly forbidden,
places grown-ups aren't usually allowed to go. Stein cannot avoid calling
attention to the wonder of this scene--Mother Goose and her gay charges
in the now-domesticated heart of darkness--"it was more than funny it
was absurd."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This self-consciousness becomes literally manifest in the moment we see
frozen in the photograph. As though the pressure of absurdity strikes the
whole company simultaneously, Stein reports that "we all got together
and pointed as Hitler had pointed" (<I>Life,</I> 57). Their collective
pose not only mimes the commanding gesture Hitler might have made as
he surveyed his country (and, by implication, the world far beyond his
field of vision). The angle of their raised arms and outstretched hands
also suggests the Sieg Heil salute itself--one of the most powerfully
iconographic gestures of the past century--now turned into the merest
assumption of an attitude. As Gallagher points out, this gesture displays
"an impulse toward mimetic and iconographic outrage," but she adds that
"Stein allies herself visually not only with the victorious American
soldiers but also with the stance of victory itself," and thus "the
female observer's vision is effectively absorbed into the trajectory of
the military gaze."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  I suggest that Stein by no means fits so easily into the soldiers'
  company, much as she takes pleasure in horsing around with them in
  the photograph. Her very next gesture sets her apart again, as she
  continues to skew the signs of war in the souvenir hunting that follows
  this anti-salute:

What I wanted was a radiator, Hitler did have splendid radiators, and

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The elegiac associations that might cluster around these future flowers
are largely negated by the strikingly odd choice of an object for
them to adorn. A radiator remains, however, just the thing that the
author of <I>Tender Buttons</I> might be expected to try to carry
away from this place. But it is not June of 1914, not the summer
when <I>Tender Buttons</I> made its fairly muted debut on the stage
of the avant-garde. This short excursion in <I>Life</I>, undertaken
in a profoundly different time, before millions rather than hundreds
of readers, depends for its success on Stein managing to retain her
identity as a famously incomprehensible artist, while also giving
a convincing performance as an unremarkable, middle-class American
tourist. The critical, satirical edge to the piece--evident in the poses
Stein assumes before the Germans and the GIs alike--derives primarily
from the odd fact that these two identities exist together in this one
radical, ordinary woman.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
     Near the end of her essay, when she and Alice Toklas are flying
     back to France with the GIs, Stein comments wryly on her plane's
     new cargo:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As is the case in all her writings about American soldiers, Stein is
entranced by the GI's English usage, the way her native language is
changing under the pressures of war. For the victors, "liberated" is
a humorously dishonest word, a euphemism, an adjective that evades an
ugly truth about the spoils of victory. It is a word that exemplifies
and characterizes Stein's lifelong project to shake words loose from
their referents, to pry words apart from things. Like "exciting and
peaceful" in <I>Paris France</I>, or dozens of other words and moments
in this body of her writing, "liberated" belongs in Stein's lexicon of
words that reference wartime while also refusing to be only about the
war. Helen Button might cry at the end of this piece too, in spite of its
cheeriness, since it gives us so little to hold on to. It liberates its
readers, finally, from a world that is too strange, too filled with the
evidence of past trauma but without the cause and effect, the inquiry
into motivation that might make that trauma fit into an explanatory
narrative. We see Stein in the photograph from Berchtesgaden liberating
a sign associated with Hitler.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  Whether this liberation is successful we will have to determine
  for ourselves. While the meanings of that sign may ultimately be as
  resistant to moving as Hitler's radiators, Stein is conducting an
  experiment, in the image and the prose she attaches to that image,
  to determine how far a public moment and an historical gesture can be
  dislocated. Gallagher, writing about this photograph in particular,
  and about Stein's post-liberation point of view, finds that "the image
  is a visual representation of the 'liberation' of Gertrude Stein from
  a set of wartime political loyalties and representations riven by
  contradictions, doubts, ambivalences, and from the continual deferral
  of political interpretation of visual and other evidence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  But for Stein, victory does not bring unambiguous clarity, reassertions
  of meaning, an end to confusions and problems of reference. It brings
  only the unsettling facts of liberation.

the day that the United States dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima. This

  It is difficult to find a newspaper or magazine published in the United

  War that does not run a series of essays on the meanings of having
  entered what is already being called the "atomic age." Stein dies
  on 27 July 1946, but shortly before her death she, too, privately
  joins this conversation about the Bomb, with a three-paragraph essay,
  "Reflection on the Atomic Bomb," published in December of 1947 in the

Romanticism and its sociopolitical agent, war, find their apotheosis
and their conclusion in this new invention--so completely destructive
that it lacks meaning. With her phrase "what is the use," she signals
the collapse of the poles of her art: poetry and history, pure and
instrumental language, private and public worlds. One cannot measure
difference or weigh winner and loser when there is "nothing left." Who
can discern dichotomies in this obliteration? Who will there be to
recognize this next form of the modern composition, she wonders: "Sure
it will destroy and kill a lot, but it's the living that are interesting
not the way of killing them, because if there were not a lot left living
how could there be any interest in destruction." There are, of course,
two enormous "lots" of "living" who would have taken issue with Stein's
assessment, however philosophically apt we might find it from our own
temporal distance: the wounded, dying, and defeated Japanese and the
enormously relieved Americans who had been granted a reprieve from the
nightmares of island invasions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Stein herself realizes that, in the wake of this second world war,
she has very little to say. It is essentially a problem of scale, of
calibrating words and things. If the Great War, with its ten million
dead, brought us into modernity, what do the fifty million dead in
its sequel bring? Why should she continue her demanding, risky search
for an appropriate register in which to write about this new form of
modernity? The history of her own art ends not with Hitler after all,
but with Harry Truman and the invention he authorizes for use. Her last
reflection on writing is almost as simple as saying nothing. Here is
the whole of her final paragraph:

Three weeks before his own death in 1939, W. B. Yeats wrote to Lady

can refute Hegel but not the Saint or the Song of Sixpence."

  Stein was probably not aware that she had cancer when she wrote her
  final sentence, and had she lived she would no doubt have found a way
  to continue using language. And yet this paragraph stands as an end of
  writing, not a beginning. Like the patient farmers in Paris France,
  like Yeats in his final days, Stein imagines living in a way that
  renders words as incidental as the weather. There are no winners and
  no losers. Only the simplest forms of narrative, the least ambitious
  kinds of naming (if the fraught activity of naming is even necessary
  at all), and the last liberation offered by nature.

Wanda Van Dusen's essay, "Portrait of a National Fetish: Gertrude Stein's

Stein's politics. Her essay appeared in

Dusen's essay. I discuss Van Dusen's essay, and Stein's "Introduction" in

Ulla E. Dydo, from her introductory notes to "Composition as Explanation,"
in <I>A Stein Reader</I>, ed. Ulla E. Dydo (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern
University Press, 1993), 494; hereafter abbreviated as "CE." I do not
find this argument convincing because in her various public utterances
Stein does not seem much concerned with a "generation gap" (witness her
<I>Lectures in America</I>--a great many of them given to University
audiences--which do not show concerns about such a "gap"; think too
about her various prolonged exchanges in both World Wars with soldiers,
with whom she clearly felt unusually comfortable.) Speaking to the young
does not seem to have posed particular problems for Stein. Nor is Dydo
entirely clear as to how bringing up the subject of war will make Stein
fit more easily with her audience (Dydo makes a passing reference to a
"post World War I audience, including some veterans"). Surely, insofar
as the war <I>was</I> on the minds of Stein's young listeners (veterans
would not have been students in 1926), nothing in contemporary English
intellectual culture would have suggested the waste and horrors of World
War I as a likely re for cultural progress. The ironies of invoking an
English "victory" to Oxbridge undergraduates would have been overwhelming
by the mid-1920s. It does Stein a disservice to assume, as Dydo does,
that she would not recognize these ironies, building this portion of her
essay around the analogy: "As one who has won the battle for the new,
she speaks to those who have won on the battlefield." (ibid.).

I base my general sketch of Stein's audience largely on my reading in
newspapers of a good many accounts of her lecture tour. Many articles on
her appearances around the country devote significant space to describing
the attending audience. Clearly, in 1934-5, it was a social coup
merely to be seen at a Stein lecture. See, for some examples, "Reporter

Reading the newspaper accounts of her tour quickly demonstrates how

Her wartime writing is read in France and England as well, but it is most
often directed primarily toward American readers, and when it is published
in periodicals, those periodicals are American. The important exception
to this generalization is <I>Paris France</I> which, in its conclusion,
calls explicitly upon England to intervene in the plight of Europe
(recall that this book was first published in England). It is important
to note, too, that this writing is comparatively widely circulated and
read. Stein makes money writing for <I>The Atlantic</I> or <I>Life</I>
that she could not make in more exclusive periodical territory. Her
second bestseller in the United States, after the <I>Autobiography,</I>

(<I>PF,</I> 65). Elsewhere in <I>Paris France,</I> Stein characterizes the
French themselves as taking comfort from language itself: "The French do
love to say a thing and say it completely. That is the reason that once a
thing is completely named it does no longer worry them. Now the word une
guerre des nerfs, has become a part of their speech, it has no longer any
effect upon their nerves. That is their logic fashion and civilisation"

wages for her passivist view that whatever is is best so long as she can

dollars from American publishers. Her bland assumption that 'the winner
loses,' even in stricken France under the Nazi heel, represents a view
that for sheer stupid optimism reaches a new low for <I>Atlantic</I>'s
pages. She says too little--too, too little--of what the <I>loser</I>
loses at the hands of ruthless Germany. (See news reports in the daily
papers. . . .)" (Carlton Wells, Letter to the Editor, <I>The Atlantic</I>

the postwar mythologies would have us believe. I have benefited from

Stein wrote this "Helen Button" section of <I>Paris France</I> some
time before beginning <I>Paris France</I> itself (and before "war
time" had literally commenced). As with so much of Stein's ostensibly

This scene is particularly terrifying in the context of Stein's work,
since through the mid- and late-1930s she has used the phrase from the
nursery rhyme, "I am I because my little dog knows me," as a focal point
for thinking about the problems of identity. Now, the tables turned, Helen

account of her trip to Germany with the 441st Troup Carrier Group may be
found in Brinnin on pages 392-4. See also the photographs from this
trip (not the same as the ones published in <I>Life</I>) in <I>Gertrude
Stein in Words and Pictures,</I> ed. Renate Stendhal (Chapel Hill, N.C.:
Algonquin Books, 1994), 246-54.

I have not been able to locate this film; it is referenced in the
caption to a photograph of the film being made, in <I>Stein in Words
and Pictures,</I> 254. Attached to the photograph is a note from
the Associated Press, saying that the film was made for "A U.S. Army
Information and Education Course."

Hitler had a villa at Berchtesgaden and a retreat--the "Adlerhorst"--above
the town as well. The photographs accompanying the <I>Life</I> piece
show Stein on the balcony of the villa, not at the "Eagle's Nest."

A more contemporary experiment that bears comparison with Stein's gesture
here is the <I>Occupations</I> series of Anselm Kiefer, the German
artist who had photographs of himself taken giving the Nazi salute in
various culturally resonant sites in Europe (the Coliseum in Rome, for
example). See the discussion of his work by Matthew Biro, <I>Anselm Kiefer
and the Philosophy of Martin Heidegger</I> (New York: Cambridge University
Press, 1998). See also the chapter on Kiefer's work in Andreas Huyssen,

<I>Yale Poetry Review,</I> no. 7 , 3. The editors of this
short-lived journal are Rolfe Fjelde, Thomas McMahon, and Harvey
Shapiro. They take the essay from the Yale archive, with the permission
of Carl Van Vechten. There is no evidence that Stein wrote the essay for
this journal, and the "they" in her opening sentence is thus somewhat
mystifying in its reference. I read it as her expression of a general
sense of the widespread asking of questions about the Bomb. Presumably
the <I>Review</I>'s editors received the information that the essay was
Stein's last completed work from Van Vechten. Richard Bridgman calls
it her "last composition" (<I>Stein in Pieces,</I> 339 n). The editors
of the Library of America <I>Writings</I> also cite this as her "last
piece of writing" (<I>GS, II,</I> 840).
