      Katherine Mansfield’s career was indelibly influenced by a prolonged and active engagement with a diverse and lively book and journalistic trade, which saw the publication of her writing in a number of formats, both “literary” and “popular.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Her short stories appeared in little magazines and illustrated papers, in books printed by prestige private presses and commercial publishing houses, and her negotiation of these varied sites of publication helps earn her a place within what Lawrence Rainey terms modernism’s “social reality: a conration of agents and practices that converge in the production, marketing, and publicization of an idiom, a shareable language in the family of twentieth century tongues.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mansfield’s modernist aesthetic evolved within the context of these diverse cultural and social institutions of early-twentieth-century publishing, and her writing life was marked by a dual commitment to achieving both artistic credibility and commercial success, oscillating between the twin poles of the “great divide” so often associated with literary modernism.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, recent scholarship has increasingly sought to challenge what Mark S. Morrisson has termed “the commonplace of modernism’s inveterate antagonism to mass culture” in order to reinterpret the spaces between “literariness” and “popularity” in early-twentieth-century culture.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Mansfield’s writing, shaped as it is by a combination of commercial and aesthetic ambitions, enacts a challenge to the categories of “high” and “popular” culture through her exploitation of different modes of publication of her work. Moreover, this challenge is further enhanced by her commitment to the short story genre, which leant itself both to technical innovation and widespread  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> circulation through a variety of channels, both “literary” and “popular.” Her textual experimentations and negotiation of a range of publication sites amount to a quest for what she termed “a new word” in her fiction, a rallying cry for new approaches to the production and consumption of fiction which she mapped out in a series of reviews first published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Between April 1919 and December 1920, during a period when she took a brief hiatus from her more familiar career as a writer of short fiction, Mansfield was employed as book reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>. This journalistic interlude would eventually give way to the final and most prolific period of her life, which saw the composition and publication of many of her most renowned and innovative stories, among them “The Daughters of the Late Colonel,” “The Garden-Party,” and “At the Bay.” However, the formative nature of her alternative career as reviewer has been underestimated. Mansfield enthusiastically exploited the environs of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> and its literary network as a forum in which to hone her craft; and this in turn was crucial to her emergence as a shrewd writer of innovative short stories that were commercially viable once she parted company with the journal at the end of 1920. Ultimately, an account of Mansfield’s use of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> to refine and promote her fictional technique enriches an understanding of her as a modernist short story writer at work in a busy publishing world; an understanding which in turn reevaluates the supposedly antagonistic relationship between “high modernism” and “popular culture” that pitted the “intellectuals” against the “masses.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Mansfield’s professional involvement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> began when her husband John Middleton Murry took over its editorship at the beginning of 1919. The two had previously collaborated on a number of avant-garde little magazines earlier in the decade—<span style="font-style:italic;">Rhythm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blue Review</span>, and the short-lived <span style="font-style:italic;">Signature</span>—but, unlike these earlier coterie publications which Murry had helped found, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> was already an established organ of literary debate by the time he took over its mantle. First launched in 1828, it had gained a formidable reputation as “the mirror of Victorian culture” throughout the nineteenth century.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> However, its impact had waned by the early decades of the twentieth century, and the task of rejuvenating the unfashionable paper fell to Murry (with financial support from the chocolatier Arnold Rowntree) and his newly-assembled team of contributors culled from the Bloomsbury and Garsington sets. Aldous Huxley was initially appointed as coeditor after T. S. Eliot turned down the position, and the paper frequently featured articles by the likes of Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Bertrand Russell and E. M. Forster, as well as Eliot and Mansfield herself.
    </p>
<p>
      Although Mansfield’s direct involvement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> was somewhat hampered by the fact that it was mainly conducted from mainland Europe where she had been convalescent since September 1919, it was considerably more extensive and dynamic than has often been implied in critical accounts of the journal. In particular, many commentators have emphasized the biographical contexts for her engagement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, often based on an overly-romanticized and sensationalist portrait of her relationship with Murry. Marysa Demoor, for example, implies that Mansfield’s decision to work for the journal was motivated by a desire to promote and further her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> husband’s career rather than her own, arguing that she “devoted the larger part of the little time she had left to live to raising the quality of the journal which, she thought, would establish her husband’s renommée as an editor and a literary critic.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Similarly, Oscar Wellens suggests that her decision to resign from the paper in December 1920 was entirely motivated by feelings of jealousy about Murry’s rumored affair with fellow short story writer and <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>-contributor Elizabeth Bibesco.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> In casting Mansfield as a jilted wife in this scenario, he ignores a more compelling reason for her resignation: after eighteen months of reviewing the work of other writers, she had renewed her ambition to publish her short stories beyond the pages of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> and had subsequently clashed with Murry over the marketing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bliss and Other Stories</span> , her first collection of short stories for nine years.
    </p>
<p>
      Such melodramatic representations of Mansfield as the devoted, but scorned, wife of the editor underestimate the professional significance of her association with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, and give insufficient consideration to the material that she published in the paper. Where critics have examined her involvement in more detail, however, they have presented an image of Mansfield that is equally problematic, often overemphasizing her supposed jealousy in her attitudes to other contemporary writers, as well as a sense of inadequacy in relation to literary predecessors such as Anton Chekhov.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> This has inevitably colored the critical attention that has been paid to her most infamous appearance in the paper: “A Ship Comes into the Harbour,” her review in November 1919 of Virginia Woolf’s second novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span>. Unsurprisingly, this has been read in the context of the increasingly fraught friendship between the two writers, which has been the subject of a number of illuminating comparative studies in recent years.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, the review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> has continued to be the subject of speculation that Mansfield’s criticism was personally motivated, primarily by feelings of resentment at Woolf’s apparently settled life which contrasted so sharply with her own itinerant lifestyle as her health worsened throughout 1919. Margaret M. Jensen, for example, suggests that, “Mansfield’s critique was influenced by her private sense of Woolf” and her “envy of Woolf’s lifestyle, of her possessing ‘so many nice things’ at once.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Such conjecture about the ways in which Mansfield’s personal circumstances and apparent jealousy may have influenced the contents of her review column again runs the risk of undermining the broader professional context in which these reviews were produced; and by reading “A Ship Comes into the Harbour” primarily in terms of its place within the “public of two” formed by the two writers, insufficient consideration has been given to the publication environment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Perhaps more crucially, the review of Woolf’s novel has dominated discussions of Mansfield’s association with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, effectively reducing almost two years of her professional writing career to the composition of a solitary review. This is to overlook the extent of her engagement with the journal, to which she contributed despite her illness throughout 1919, offering advice on how it should be run until the end of 1920 (when she officially resigned from its team of reviewers; Murry’s editorship ended in February 1921, when the financially-troubled paper merged with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>). Her letters from the period are filled with commentary on individual issues and suggestions  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> for improvements; and when she was in London she was (as she puts it in a letter to Sydney and Violet Schiff) kept busy with “manuscripts to be read, poems, essays to choose ‘finally’, novels to review, schemes to draft, an article to write on <span style="font-style:italic;">why we intend to publish short stories</span>.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> After the paper followed through on this commitment to the publication of short fiction, Mansfield contributed a number of stories of her own to the journal, appearing at roughly one-month intervals; one prose sketch (“Perambulations”) and another story (“Revelations”) had appeared prior to the paper’s announcement in June 1920 that it would “devote a portion of space henceforward to prose fiction.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> She also contributed a number of poems under the pseudonym “Elizabeth Stanley”; a series of translations (in collaboration with S. S. Koteliansky) of the letters of Anton Chekhov; and, in July and August 1920, three leaders, two offering commentary on contemporary publishing trends and the other detailing the arrival of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks in London three months after their wedding, and demonstrating Mansfield’s preference for the films of Charlie Chaplin.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, her primary role at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> was as reviewer of fiction in a weekly column, which quickly became a highlight.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Between April 1919 and December 1920, “K. M.” published over one hundred and fifteen literary reviews of novels and short stories.
    </p>
<p>
      In her memoir, her friend Ida Baker (“Lesley Moore”) provides another image of Mansfield at work as a reviewer which has proven enduring: “[t]hey had to be done by a certain date, whether she was ill or not, and she found most of the books so dull, so impossible to write about with interest.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, a closer examination of the published reviews themselves provides a much more compelling picture than this account of a frustrated and ailing writer. Her first column, “Three Women Novelists,” indicates the mixture of material under review, from the experimental prose of Dorothy Richardson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tunnel</span> to more popular forms like Mrs. Victor Rickard’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The House of Courage</span>; a similar range is apparent in her short story reviews, from Virginia Woolf’s “Kew Gardens” to more obvious magazine fare like <span style="font-style:italic;">A Sailor’s Home</span> by “Richard Dehan” (the pseudonym of the popular Irish writer Clotilde Graves).<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Mansfield may well have found the specifics of some of this material under review “dull” and she was undoubtedly frequently critical of her fellow writers and dwelled on their shortcomings, but that is not necessarily to say that she found them “impossible to write about with interest.” In fact, the task of wading through this material engendered a reappraisal of fictional forms and conventions that would underpin her literary output from this point on.
    </p>
<p>
      Mansfield’s criticisms of her contemporaries need to be understood, not as the product of an insecure author who aimed to run down the work of more talented rivals in order to offset her own limitations, but as evidence of her ongoing project to perfect her short story aesthetic. In judging her peers, Mansfield was inevitably faced with the necessity of reappraising her own development as a writer of fiction; by pointing up the weaknesses in her contemporaries’ work, she aimed to encourage them to engage in a similar project of self-interrogation. Ultimately, the body of reviews that she wrote throughout 1919 and 1920 constitutes her manifesto for the kind of literary fiction that she deemed necessary as the twentieth century entered its third decade, and her criticism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of her peers amounts to a rallying cry to them to “make it new,” in Ezra Pound’s famous summation of the modernist project. Throughout her career as reviewer, she was engaged in establishing the parameters of this envisioned literary aesthetic, and it was through her association with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> that she would consolidate her position as a writer of formally inventive short stories in a commercial publishing world.
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout 1919 and 1920, Mansfield used her review column to interrogate the place of fiction in the contemporary world and its need to break free of conventional and conservative forms, placing particular emphasis on the dominant prose genre of the novel. The review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> makes this clear from its opening paragraph:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	There is at the present day no form of writing which is more eagerly, more widely discussed than the novel. What is its fate to be? We are told on excellent authority that it is dying; and on equally good authority that only now it begins to live. Reviewers might almost be divided into two camps. . . . But in all this division and confusion it would seem that opinion is united in declaring this to be an age of experiment. If the novel dies it will be to give way to some new form of expression; if it lives it must accept the fact of a new world.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Throughout the First World War and its immediate aftermath, Mansfield’s private letters and journals frequently recorded her belief that the time had come for both a “new form of expression” and a “new world.” As she grappled with the review of Woolf’s novel, she wrote to Murry that: “I feel in the profoundest sense that nothing can ever be the same—that, as artists, we are traitors if we feel otherwise; we have to take it into account and find new expressions, new moulds for our new thoughts and feelings” (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: III, 82, 10 November 1919). Eventually, this commitment to “making it new” would escalate into an all-out antipathy to formal conservatism in fiction—both literary and popular—in the immediate postwar period.
    </p>
<p>
      To read Mansfield’s reviews from start to finish is to chart her increasing frustration at the array of what she considered inferior, formulaic work that found its way into print at a time at which she continued to struggle to publish her short stories outside of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> itself. In her first column she noted what she saw as a growing trend in fiction, identifying that the problem lay as much with contemporary writers as with the expanded and changing reading public that had emerged with the rise of the working and leisured classes: “Reading, for the great majority—for the reading public—is not a passion but a pastime, and writing, for the vast number of modern authors, is a pastime and not a passion.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> As her column developed, she became increasingly irritated by the prevalence of this “pastime” fiction as she deemed it; her review of Compton Mackenzie’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Vanity Girl</span> offers an illustrative anecdote of the inadequacies both of an undemanding audience and an author that seemed unwilling to challenge such a readership:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
      It was our fortune some time ago to overhear the following conversation:
    <br>
      “Is that a new one, dear?”
    <br>
      “Well, yes, dear, I suppose it is.”
    <br>
      “How far have you got, dear?”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>
	“Chapter twenty-seven.”
      <br>
	“Make room, dear; let’s read the synopsis.”
      <br>
	“Oh, that’s not new, dear. That’s just the same as usual.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Mansfield’s private correspondence further reflects her escalating dissatisfaction with contemporary novels. On 25 September 1920 she wrote to Murry that:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  It is an awful temptation, in face of all these novels to cry “Woe—woe!” I cannot conceive how writers who have lived through our times can <span style="font-style:italic;">drop</span> these last ten years and revert to why Edward didn’t understand, Vi’s reluctance to be seduced or (see Bennett) why a dinner of twelve covers needs remodelling. If I did not review novels I’d never read them.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 50–51, 25 September 1920)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  It is in these terms that Mansfield’s dismissal of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> should be read, motivated not by jealousy of Woolf, but by disappointment in the woman whose first novel (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>) had been more experimental. By these standards, <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> was a huge letdown, as is evidenced by Mansfield’s concluding description of it as “a novel in the tradition of the English novel. In the midst of our admiration it makes us feel old and chill: we had never thought to look upon its like again!”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In Mansfield’s eyes, then, <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> (like Mackenzie’s novel) might be deemed “just the same as usual,” a formulaic throwback to the social milieu of Jane Austen and insufficiently attuned to the “new moulds and new expressions” now necessary for the reinvention of fiction generally, and the novel in particular.
	</p>
<p>
	  Shortly after Mansfield’s review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> appeared, Murry wrote to her with an account of a subsequent meeting he had with Woolf, reporting the latter’s claim that “your novel reviews showed that you were not interested in novels. I thought that was a very illuminating remark, illuminating Virginia of course.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Rather than merely revealing bitterness at having been slighted in print by her friend and rival, though, Woolf’s comment seems to reflect her recognition of Mansfield’s growing disquiet at the privileging of “the tradition of the English novel.” Indeed, it might provide some indication of the nature of the discussions about work and writing that the two engaged in throughout their friendship, which was based on the fact that (as Mansfield put it in one letter), “We have got the same job, Virginia &amp; it is really very curious &amp; thrilling that we should both, quite apart from each other, be after so very nearly the same thing” (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: I, 327, 23 August 1917). Although Woolf herself was subsequently to help reinvent “the tradition of the English novel” with <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waves</span>, with <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> she had apparently failed to build on the experimental impulses first evident in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>. Even more crucially, <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> seemed like a step back from material like “Kew Gardens” and “The Mark on the Wall,” the experimental short fiction that Woolf had begun to produce and of which Mansfield was more complimentary, having published a positive review of the former in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> in June 1919, five months before the publication of the unadventurous <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span>. Mansfield’s rejection of conservative novelistic forms and her own ambitions to promote the short story as an alternative medium is clearly  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> expressed in a review published in June 1920, which most closely approximates her manifesto. In “Wanted, a New Word” (significantly, a review of a series of short story collections), she called that it was time for the expression of a “new word” in fiction. For Mansfield, then, this “new word” was to be fundamentally linked with her commitment to the short story genre.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mansfield’s own breakthrough as a short story writer had come with the composition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span>, which in total took some two and a half years to complete; it was finally published in July 1918, hand-printed by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press. The composition of the story is most often linked with her grief at the death of her brother, Leslie Heron Beauchamp, in the First World War, which prompted her resolution to find “a kind of special prose” in which to pay tribute to him.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> The “kind of special prose” that Mansfield committed herself to in 1916 would eventually evolve into the terms of “Wanted, a New Word.” The phrase itself had previously appeared in a journal entry from July 1919, in which she wrote of her belief that “the time for a ‘new word’ has come but I imagine the new word will not be spoken easily. People have never explored the lovely medium of prose—It is a hidden country still.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> The review itself appeared almost a year later, and has been described by Clare Hanson as “virtually the only ‘manifesto’ KM produced for the kind of fiction she herself wrote.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> It poses a riddle:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I am neither a short story, nor a sketch, nor an impression, nor a tale. I am written in prose. I am a great deal shorter than a novel; I may be only one page long, but, on the other hand, there is no reason why I should not be thirty. I have a special quality—a something, a something which is immediately, perfectly recognizable. It belongs to me; it is of my essence. In fact I am often given away in the first sentence. I seem almost to stand or fall by it. It is to me what the first phrase of the song is to the singer. Those who know me feel: “Yes, that is it.” And they are from that moment prepared for what is to follow. Here are, for example, some examples of me: “A Trifle from Life”, “About Love”, “The Lady with the Dog”. What am I?<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Mansfield does not answer the final question within the review, except to claim that the material under discussion (Elizabeth Robins’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mills of the Gods</span>; Arnold Palmer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">My Profitable Friends</span>; and Dorothy Easton’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Bird</span>) does not successfully fulfill these criteria. Her definition of the “new word” required in fiction is actually presented as a series of negatives.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> She cannot define it in any positive, autonomous terms: it is only presented as the series of illustrative Chekhovian examples at the end, and is only defined in relation to what it is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span>, a short story (specifically, the kind of plotted short story that remained a mainstay of popular publishing) or a novel.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> This amorphous definition might be applied to Mansfield’s own fiction, which categorically refused to conform to the plotted conventions of the short story form; a letter to Dorothy Brett, for example, records her scornful reaction to a request for a technically “marketable” story in November 1921:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    I ate such a stupid man with my tea—I cant digest him. He is bringing out a book of Georgian Stories and he said the more “plotty” a story I could give him the better. What  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> about that for a word? It made my hair stand up in prongs. A nice “plotty” story, please. People are funny.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 311, 2 November 1921)
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Instead of plot, Mansfield’s short stories would prioritize impressionistic prose, epiphanic structures, and a movement inwards to focus on the inner workings of her characters’ minds.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> The opaqueness of these techniques is evident in the vague critical language adopted in the published review; moreover, a “new word” would be needed to describe this new form and its associated subject matter.
	  </p>
<p>
	    “Wanted, a New Word” provides a blueprint for the kind of fiction that Mansfield now aimed to promote, and its discussion of the short story form is in keeping with a recurring feature of her review column: the endorsement of the short story rather than the novel as the genre most adaptable to literary experimentation in the postwar world. Unsurprisingly, her novel reviews also demonstrate an increasing tendency to comment on the pressures of short story publication and the persistent critical assumption about the “inferior” nature of the form itself. She makes a wryly humorous gesture to the perceived lowliness of the craft in a review of Margaret Symonds’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Child of the Alps</span> and Jane Mander’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Story of a New Zealand River</span>:
	  </p>

In the case of the short story it is possible to give orders that, unless the house is on fire—and even then, not until the front staircase is well alight—one must not be disturbed; but a novel is an affair of weeks, of months; time after time the author is forced to leave what he has written to-day exposed to what may happen before to-morrow.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p></blockquote>

	    Given the tortured route Mansfield took to complete and publish <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> (on which she began work in March 1915, finally delivering the complete manuscript to the Woolfs in October 1917) it is clear that her tongue is firmly in her cheek here. A lingering sense of the perceived inferiority of the short story is further evident in a review of Compton Mackenzie’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Poor Relations</span> and Gilbert Cannan’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Time and Eternity</span>, where Mansfield’s sense of humor once more comes to the fore:

<p class="continued">
	    Inherent in this apparently throwaway remark, of course, is Mansfield’s suggestion that the short story continued to be viewed as a devalued form: the subtext to the statement may be interpreted as “to be taken seriously in England a <span style="font-style:italic;">writer</span> must be a <span style="font-style:italic;">novelist</span>.” Short stories, after all, were deemed the province either of the apprentice “serious” writer or the contented “popular” writer, a preconception that Mansfield actively aimed to challenge in the final years of her career.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	    Her parenthetical quip that “nobody will publish short stories” indicates a further source of anxiety at the time, namely that she was finding it difficult to find anywhere that would publish her own work. Reviewing her two most recent book publications in the <span style="font-style:italic;">TLS</span> in January 1920, for example, Harold Childs had dubbed <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Je ne parle pas français</span> “two stories of the ‘awkward’ length which, as publishers declare, the public finds too long for a short story and too short for a novel.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Each had been published in a single-story edition by a small, private press: the Hogarth Press published three hundred copies of <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> while the Heron Press printed one hundred copies of <span style="font-style:italic;">Je ne parle pas français</span>, of which twenty were spoiled and only sixty sold. However, such select and limited readerships were now inadequate in Mansfield’s eyes; indeed, her breakthrough with <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> had actually coincided with a firm commitment to achieving critical and commercial success with the new material that she began to produce at this time by delivering this work to as wide an audience as possible. An integral aspect of her “kind of special prose” was, of course, that it would be formally innovative. In a series of oft-quoted journal entries during the composition of the story, she expressed her commitment to a new form of writing and it is from this time that her development of a modernist aesthetic is usually traced. On 22 January 1916, she had written that, “the form that I would choose has changed utterly. I feel no longer concerned with the same appearances of things. The people who lived or who I wished to bring into my stories don’t interest me any more. The <span style="font-style:italic;">plots</span> of my stories leave me perfectly cold.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Quoted less frequently, however, is another entry written two weeks afterwards on 3 February:

<div class="attrib">
	      (emphasis mine)
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Mansfield’s commitment to a new form, then, coincided directly with her most openly expressed commercial ambition: throughout the second half of her career she aimed to fuse these two impulses; attempted to clarify an aesthetic approach that was simultaneously “modernist” <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> commercially viable; and came to recognize the need to expand and reinvent an audience for this new fiction.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Before she really came to terms with these ambitions in her reviews for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, however, she wrote a piece of prose fiction which displays similar concerns about the necessity of establishing an audience for her work, and the corresponding anxiety about how this might leave her exposed to indifferent editorial, critical, and reading publics. The little-known “Perambulations” appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> in May 1919, and its composition was clearly motivated by Mansfield’s frustration at the lack of an outlet for her work; she had recently failed to secure a contract for the publication of a volume of her stories with William Heinemann’s firm.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> This rejection doubtless influenced the basic premise of the sketch, which details secondhand an author’s account of a dream of submitting a manuscript to a publisher and meeting with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ridicule, and the fundamental problem for the author presented in “Perambulations” is her failure to overcome the first hurdle in the necessary process of distributing her writing. The sketch begins:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		She told me she dreamed she took her darling to a publisher, and, having placed it upon the altar, she made obeisance and waited to hear if it should be found worthy in his sight for a sacrifice. And he asked her how old she was. She had to confess that, though she had seen him quite recently and they had spent a wonderful time together, she never would see Thirty again.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      The sacrificial language suggests the author’s anxiety about the fate that awaits her “darling” should it actually be published, but in her dream, she fails even to impress her initial audience of the publisher. Moreover, it is not only the author’s novel that meets with rejection, but also the author herself; the publisher’s refusal to take seriously the author’s delivery of her novel after reaching the advanced age of thirty echoes Mansfield’s wry sense that her own preferred genre continued to be perceived as at best an apprentice and at worst a lesser art. The publisher dismisses her delivery of her first novel “fourteen or fifteen years” too late, and at a time when she “ought to be either writing [her] memoirs or crackin’ up the new generation. We’ve no use for anything in the creative line that’s not brought to market in the green ear.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> As a result, she sees herself as “doomed to pass these delicious hours of our fine flowering not only unwept (which doesn’t matter so much), but quite absolutely unhonoured and unsung—which does.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> More specifically, “Perambulations” reflects the problematic status of an author who remains “unread,” an anxiety that would preoccupy Mansfield for the remainder of her career as she came to appreciate more fully her public role as a writer within the marketplace. Writing to Murry two years later, for example, she was to describe her reaction to the appearance of “At the Bay” in the <span style="font-style:italic;">London Mercury</span> as “such a queer feeling—after one has dropped a pebble in. Will there be a ripple or not?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: III, 229, 9 May 1921). In “Perambulations,” it is the <span style="font-style:italic;">lack</span> of an audience for her work that preys on the author’s mind; and the sketch is clearly a product of Mansfield’s developing awareness of the need to publish her work in a broader context. Her reviews see her interrogating this need in much more rigorous terms.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As Mansfield’s career progressed, she was to become increasingly conscious of the necessity of locating her work within a commercial realm in order to establish herself as an author, and throughout her review columns she frequently questioned the nature of the relationship between the author, the text, and the reading public. She established the theme in her opening column:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		It is terrifying to think of the number of novels that are written and announced and published and to be had of all libraries, and reviewed and bought and borrowed and read, and left in hotel lounges and omnibuses and railway carriages and deck chairs. Is it possible to believe that each one of them was once the darling offspring of some proud author,—his cherished hope in whom he lives his second richer life?<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Even here it is possible to trace Mansfield’s fundamental sense of difference as a writer of short stories: if novels led such a precarious existence, what was to be the fate of the majority of her short stories that did not as yet exist in book form, appearing rather in disposable formats of papers and journals? From the very beginning of her career as reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, then, Mansfield highlighted the tension between the autonomy of a work of art and the necessary reproduction of it in delivering it to an audience. This concern would inform many of her reviews in the following eighteen months, and would preoccupy her for the remainder of her career. For example, she wrote to Murry on 24 February 1920 that:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		I never knew before what killed Dickens. It was money. He couldn’t as he grew older resist money: he became a miser &amp; disguised it under a laughing exterior. Money and applause—he died for both. How fearful that is! But still my own precious we must have the books. We must have his complete works . . . .
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: III, 229, 24 February 1920)
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		Mansfield’s conflict here is obvious. On the one hand, she suggests that Dickens’s early death was brought about by his location within (and engagement with) the commercial realm of literature and the cult of celebrity fed by an avid paying audience; on the other, she implies that this “killed” him in that it affected the image he projected for his public, and influenced the kind of material he produced as his career advanced. Yet commercial publishing had facilitated the continued dissemination of Dickens’s work fifty years after his death, and in Mansfield’s role as consumer of his novels and in her desire to own his complete works, she must acknowledge her own participation in the very processes which she claims brought about both the commodification of his writing and his self-destructive celebrity. Although Mansfield often perceived the problematic nature of her own attempts at employing similar methods of promoting herself and her work, it is evident that she became increasingly aware of the necessity of doing so in order to be an author. By the end of 1921, she made this clear in a letter to Dorothy Brett:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  Dont you think an artist ought to have a show at least once a year? It seems to me almost as necessary as for a writer to produce a book. That sort of contact with the public—even the feelings of being at the mercy of the public is somehow <span style="font-style:italic;">right</span>. After all, we express these things because we want a bigger audience than ourselves—We want to reveal what we have seen.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 292, 5 October 1921)
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Her immersion in the publishing world of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> in particular honed her sense of obligation in engaging with this realm in order to “reveal what she had seen.”
		</p>
<p>
		  Mansfield also came to recognize that, in order to produce a new form that would have any kind of impact, it was not only necessary to write a “new word” but also, through a more complex engagement with a variety of publication strategies, to address (or establish) a new audience. In essence, Mansfield’s developing perception of her artistic role would necessitate the production of a new form and the publication of it for a diverse readership; this audience should in turn modify its expectations in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> order to consume something that was “not the same as usual” and more than mere “pastime” fiction. In a review of October 1919, she had written of F. Brett Young’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Young Physician</span>: “If only Mr. Young could forget the impatient public and let himself be carried away into places where he thinks they do not care to follow!”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> The problem here identified is not so much that the “impatient public” is unwilling to read something new, but that contemporary writers assume this to be the case and fail to challenge their audience’s expectations as a result. By contrast, Mansfield seems to imply that if she is prepared to produce a “new word,” her audience will in turn be prepared to consume it. Mansfield’s later career was characterized by just such a challenge to generic expectations as she continued to refine her approach to the short story form and the contexts in which she published her work. Her renegotiation of the short story form was central to her strategic placement of challenging new material which would, by implication, change the way in which the short story was read and perceived. Throughout 1921 and 1922, for example, she began experimenting with different sites in which to publish her work, continuing to appear in literary journals (such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">London Mercury</span>) but also exploiting illustrated papers such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sphere</span> to suit her own needs; and in February 1922, the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden Party and Other Stories</span>, her third collection of short stories, coincided with the appearance of the title story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Westminster Gazette</span> over the course of three Saturdays. Many of these stories which made their initial appearances in the more perishable formats of newspapers and magazines would subsequently be included in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden Party</span> collection. The diversity of these sites of publication and their associated readerships—and more importantly the resultant commercial and popular success that she was to achieve—was to prompt Wyndham Lewis’s snide dismissal of Mansfield as “the famous New Zealand Mag.-story writer,” but this is to invoke a binary of high and low culture that she actually aimed to renegotiate in her ambition to forge a new reading public and achieve a synthesis between these “literary” and “popular” sites of publication that attempted to undermine the distinction between such categories.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> As a direct result of her career as a reviewer, Mansfield would ultimately aim for a greater sense of accessibility in her art, publishing material in a variety of journals and papers that continued to disseminate her “new word,” but in contexts that were available to a more diverse readership. In order to put this plan into effect, though, she needed to move beyond the environs of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, which had begun to prove stultifying.
		</p>
<p>
		  Her disdain for the increasingly predictable nature of the material she reviewed for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> became increasingly apparent in her private writing, as for example to Sydney Schiff on 3 November 1920:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>

		  </p>
<p>
		    I wish there were 6 or 7 writers who wrote for themselves and let the world go hang.

<div class="attrib">
		    (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 99, 3 November 1920)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      By the end of her stint as reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, Mansfield was evidently disheartened by the continued proliferation of “safe” literary forms, written to a readymade market. Her brief career at the journal had seen her read and review nearly one hundred and fifty novels and short story collections. The process of wading through this mass of material ultimately sharpened her awareness of the position of literary fiction within the marketplace, but also strengthened her perception of the dangers of complacency and the inadequacies of writing to a pre-approved audience. Once she began to write and publish short stories again throughout 1920, her irritation at the fact that she should feel forced to review what she regarded as unchallenging and substandard fare at the expense of producing her own fiction continued to mount. On 6 December 1920, she wrote to Murry about the increasing pressures of her weekly review column:
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			Its <span style="font-style:italic;">hell</span> to know that one could do so much &amp; be bound to journalism for bread. If I was a proper journalist Id give the day to reviewing &amp; so on—but no! Reviewing is on my chest—AND a sense of GUILT the whole week! However it cant be helped. Ill win out and then I dont want to read another novel for ———— But isn’t it grim to be reviewing [E. F.] Benson when one might be writing ones own stories which one will never have time to write, on the best showing!
		      </p>
<div class="attrib">
			(<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 136, 6 December 1920)
		      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			She resigned as reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> two days later. December 1920 also saw the publication of her second collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bliss and Other Stories</span>, and a return to her sole commitment to short story writing. She approached this return to fiction writing with a rejuvenated sense of her purpose as an author in need of a public, and her development of a short story form which was both formally innovative and commercially successful would characterize the final years of her writing life.
		      </p>
<p>
			The <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> had provided Mansfield with the means to consolidate her status as a professional short story writer, leading finally to her enduring success. The body of reviews that she produced between 1919 and 1920 presents an insight into Mansfield’s reactions to literary and popular texts as they appeared in the immediate postwar period, as well as forming a manifesto which called for a renegotiation of reading and writing practices by her contemporary readers and fellow authors. Mansfield’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> contributions chart her evolving understanding of the workings of the literary marketplace, and her growing sense of the potential for combating a perceived conflict between artistic and commercial ambition by means of a complex negotiation of “popular” and “literary” sites in the dissemination of her fiction. Ultimately, the theories expounded by Mansfield in her journalistic output equipped her with the tools she needed to establish a brand of literary modernism that was both formally experimental <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> commercially viable; it was here that she found the space in which to articulate “a new word.”

Mansfield’s prose contributions were as follows: “Perambulations,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4644 (2 May 1919), 264–65; “Revelations,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4072 (11 June 1920), 758–59; “The Escape,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4706 (9 July 1920), 40; “Bank Holiday,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4710 (6 August 1920), 166–67; “The Wind Blows,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4713 (27 August 1920), 262–63; “Sun and Moon,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4718 (1 October 1920), 430–32; “The Young Girl,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4722 (29 October 1920), 575–77; “Miss Brill,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4726 (26 November 1920), 722–23; “The Lady’s Maid,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4730 (24 December 1920), 858–59.

    One misguided reader who assumed she was a man praised her as follows: “The method of criticism employed by your contributor . . . seems to me one of the utmost subtlety and value. . . . I should say he had invented an entirely new method of dealing with modern fiction. In no other reviews of novels is a sense of the quality of the work so precisely given.” William Henderson, “Letter to the Editor: A Model Story,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> No. 4704 (25 June 1920), 842.

    Mansfield is presumably using “short story” here in the “plotted” or magazine sense of the phrase, but she does not make the distinction explicit; nor is she consistent in her use of the term, since her review of Woolf’s plotless, experimental “Kew Gardens” was published in a column entitled “A Short Story.”
