<p id="lead">The odds were stacked against surrealism in Germany after May 1945. Immediately after the armistice, obituaries counted it as another avant-garde fatality. Dieter Wyss, for example, insisted in his surrealism primer from 1949/1950 that the 1947 Parisian surrealism retrospective confirmed his suspicions that "surrealism is practically dead, at least in its homeland." "This is not surprising," he continued, "for it anticipated what became horrifically real between the years 1933 to 1945."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Whether and when surrealism died remains uncertain. Did it expire in France with its political turn around 1929, the German invasion of Western Europe in 1939, Breton's American exile in 1940, the end of the war and the surrealist revival in Paris in 1945, or Breton's death in 1966? Posed solely within the German context, the question assumes entirely different dimensions. Did surrealism ever establish itself firmly enough in Germany before National Socialism eradicated so-called "degenerate art" such that a postwar appearance could be called a return? Was the negligible interest in surrealism in postwar Germany the result of a second failed attempt to transplant foreign goods onto German soil? Was surrealism, over twenty years old, dead on arrival? In 1956, Theodor Adorno answered the last of these questions in the affirmative: "After the European catastrophe," he insisted, "the Surrealist shocks lost their force."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Adorno's emphasis on the mitigated shocks of surrealism suggested that, in the shadow of Auschwitz, surrealism became unable to trump the dialectic of enlightenment. </p>

<p>Surrealist literature did germinate, however, in war-torn Germany. In poems written in Nazi Germany, Karl Krolow employed surrealist metaphor, which continued well after his 

<b></b>

first postwar collection, <i>Gedichte</i> from 1948. In September 1947 at the first meeting of what would become West Germany's leading literary salon, <i>Gruppe 47</i>, hostess Ilse Schneider-Lengyel was invited to read "her surrealist poems and with them introduced a peculiar element into the working group."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Alfred Andersch declared at the group's second meeting that surrealism (among other aesthetic approaches) had already proven capable, albeit with varying degrees of success, of paving the way for a renewed German literature intimately committed to freedom.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  One year later, Berlin poet Johannes Hübner took stock of surrealism and concluded that it adequately captured the paradoxes at work in the concept of the beautiful in the atomic age.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In spite of these early attempts to rehabilitate it, the surrealist impulse, unspeakably too "peculiar" for German readers and writers, failed to take root in West Germany.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Some critics even lambasted it as a "curse of morbid decadence."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The solitary pursuit of surrealism in the fifties garnered, unsurprisingly, confusion and even rejection. Paul Celan, Unica Zürn, and Peter Weiss, three now canonized German writers, are exceptional cases among young West Germany's coterie of surrealists. While their work explored markedly different forms and themes, their interest in surrealism developed in response to surviving Germany's hellish past. Neither borne out of nostalgia for the interwar avant-garde nor grounded in an ideology of postwar cultural renewal, their surrealisms grew out of personal experiences of being elsewhere, as an exile, an émigré, or somewhere in between. For all three, the specters of violence from the fascist past not only shaped their individual sense of displacement but also brought them to modify surrealism in order to give voice to the realities of this interminable condition after war and genocide. If, according to Edward Said, literature plays a pivotal role in the exile's quest to "overcome . . . the crippling sorrow of estrangement," surrealism enabled these writers to illuminate the brokenness endemic to the exilic experience.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For the German-Jewish Weiss, the brokenness of exile persisted as a central theme in his work and his personal life well after 1945. Weiss makes clear that the circumstances responsible for his unending sense of estrangement originated in 1938 with his flight from fascism, which landed him in Sweden the following year. In an interview from 1979, he remarked, "the 50s were in large part more exilic for me than the years during fascism." This was because Germany had failed after the armistice, geo-political division, and a hasty economic reconstruction to resemble the place he had once called home.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  With respect to Weiss's fascination with surrealism, scholarship has focused on measuring its authenticity vis-à-vis French forerunners and assessing its relevance in his early Swedish painting and literature (1940–1947) as well as his final magnum opus, <i>The Aesthetics of Resistance</i> (1975–1981).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  His short novel that took West Germany by storm—<i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i> written in 1952—has garnered, however, negligible attention from scholars of Weiss's surrealism.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This omission is perplexing given that 1952 marks the beginning of Weiss's avant-garde film career and his shift from painting to collage; the influence of surrealists Luis Buñuel and Max Ernst on these less well-known works is unmistakable. Situating the novel with respect to Weiss's visual turn to the surreal is crucial, for its links to and departures from the surrealist idiom expose not only the relevance of surrealism for coping with the effects 

<b></b>

of exile but also the necessary post-fascist transformations of surrealism required to articulate this condition. Appraising the complementarity and tensions between Weiss's media must begin by questioning Weiss's own misleading assertion that his literary debut was just a linguistic exercise meant to facilitate the re-acquisition of German after years of writing and speaking Swedish.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Much more than a mere linguistic exercise, <i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i> illustrates the material body's centrality in the experience of exile and points toward an alternative to the unfulfillable desire to mend this broken body. According to Weiss's surrealist economy of representation, language exacerbates this corporeal crisis, which only the visual can adequately avoid. Weiss's engagement with surrealism illustrates the historically contingent realignment of the relationality between the avant-garde and realism that prevailed among those few who brought what was once radical modernism to bear on the postwar specters of fascist violence. </p>

Exile and the Body Torn Asunder
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Initially rejected and then eight years later accepted for publication, Weiss's widely acclaimed and, in its time, shockingly unique "micro-novel" was originally printed in a limited pressing. Comprised of eleven loosely connected vignettes and seven collages, the work has been characterized as a veiled account of Weiss's austere exilic existence in rural Sweden. One of eleven guests in a remote country boarding house, the nameless first-person protagonist—the narrative eye of the text—mentions neither deportation nor expatriation as having shaped his or the fates of the novel's other characters. However, his meticulous observations of three days of eccentric events in and around the house make clear that this is not the boarders' home. Not until the arrival of the coachman toward the book's close does the severity of their isolation from the outside world come into view. The message the coachman's body bears is anticipated in the visual reconnaissance with which the novel begins. </p>

<p>In the first vignette, the narrator surveys visually the terrain surrounding the boarding house's privy. "Through the half-open door I see the muddy, trampled path and the rotten planks around the pigsty."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  With little to see, he resorts to acoustically scanning his environs: snorting pigs, the wind, crows, dripping rainwater, a saw, and a man humming. He then emerges from the privy and confirms visually the spatial relationships only partially imaginable aurally. The spatial orientation of the self and the constitution of its identity assume primary importance. Inside a box with a narrow aperture, a camera obscura of sorts, the narrator—his task on the toilet is that of "concentration" and "observation"—establishes a teleology between "I see," "I hear," and "I can imagine." This shift allows him to assemble the outside world out of perceived parts. His vantage point brings him to declare in the second vignette, "I am now located . . . ."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This slippage between epistemological wholeness and ontological certitude at the novel's opening is not as stable as it might seem. Of the eleven other bodies the narrator sees, he perceives none as being whole in spite of his thoroughness. Mr. Schnee, a fellow boarder, is evoked at first solely in terms of his hands. Heightening 

<b></b>

this fragmentation, the protagonist sees Mr. Schnee's face framed in a windowpane. The narrator then encounters a tailor whose corporeal fragmentation is intimated by his clothes, stitched together entirely out of scraps. Through another window, he also witnesses a tableau vivant in the young family's apartment. The narrator captures not only the room's contours but also the spatial relationship of their bodies fixed within space: the mother's breast vis-à-vis the infant's mouth, the agitated father's fist, face, and mouth vis-à-vis the son's chin, shoulders, and ears. The family's bodies are never evoked as being whole. Phenomenally, the narrator segments their bodies and frames select parts for exhaustive inspection. This metonymic displacement of the whole to its parts is anything but arbitrary. Concentration on the family's organs, limbs, and orifices draws attention to those somatic sites with the greatest symbolic potency in the family's Oedipal conflict and thus conveys an illusory sense of symbolic wholeness where materially there is none. </p>

<p>The narrator's underlying desire to "give an outline to what I've seen" hardly comes to fruition from this metonymic attention to body parts (C, 18). His fixation on limbs, their features, and exact movements prevails throughout. In his most severe protocols, he erases the subject entirely and implies that limbs are fully automated and independent. The meal in the fourth vignette includes a handful of salient passages that exemplify this shift: "Hands holding spoons are now lifted toward the pots from all sides . . . "; "the mouths open"; "the tin mugs are occasionally grabbed by the other hands"; and " . . . the liquid penetrates into the mouths" (C, 8–9). This fervor to document every microscopic detail accomplishes the exact opposite of omniscience. Body fragmentation assumes its most literal manifestation outside the realm of perception, in the person of the doctor. Incorrectly described as a "whole body," the doctor is actually an assemblage whose individual parts are sutured together by stitches and bandages from head to legs (C, 8). He later implies in a litany of whispered sentence fragments that he has performed nothing less than a vivisection on himself. The numerous invasive incisions, lacerations, biopsies, and drainages he has undertaken—all brought about because of a mysterious and enduring pain he wishes to excise surgically—result in total disorientation: "arm all slashed, lose direction, lose the door, the table, wrong door, don't know upstairs, downstairs, up or down, sit in the dark, don't know arm or leg, pain the same . . . " (C, 22). In this vertiginous state, he removes his black sunglasses to reveal his "empty, whitish" eyes and concludes that there is "nothing more to see, even the strongest light, all in the dark" (C, 22). The doctor's body occupies a crucial position in the novel's corporeal economy, for it illustrates a radical divide between feelings of pain (whose origins are as nebulous as those of the boarders), the corporeal fragmentation it generates, and the ability to perceive these symptoms with the naked eye. </p>

<p>The doctor's self-mutilated body sheds light on the narrator's own complicated relationship to his own body. Whereas the doctor suffers from debilitating pain that severs, disorients, and blinds, the narrator is committed to the exact opposite: assembling, orienting, and seeing. Unlike the other boarders, he perceives a path away from what he calls the "new, short, and broken-off" and toward a position of sustained clarity and wholeness (C, 6). His one-point perspective is a quest for power over the 

<b></b>

subjects in his line of vision; while their bodies fail to heed his phenomenal pursuit of wholeness, his body initially seems intact, a whole body subsumed by authority of the "I" that accordingly disappears behind the eye. In contradistinction to his ability to perceive other bodies in pieces, he is repeatedly unable to document his own body parts' minute actions. "I, I hardly notice how I eat," he admits during the meal with the other boarders (C, 10). This looking beyond the self such that the lived body disappears from view follows normative patterns of perceptual embodiment. According to philosopher Drew Leder, "The body conceals itself precisely in the act of revealing what is Other."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Although the narrator refrains from engaging in the doctor's self-mutilation, his being-in-the-world is not as exceptional as it first seems. In spite of his conviction that he is an intact subject fixed in time and space and devoid of the phenomenal dissociation, metonymic condensation, or surgical segmentation of the other body-objects, his body also succumbs to fragmentation. As is the case with the other boarders, his limbs revolt against his absent whole self such that they, too, become the motor that propels him through time and space. This first occurs in vignette two with his passage from the outhouse to his attic room: "my hands pulled me, and my feet under which the steps were creaking pushed me higher and higher . . . " (C, 5). The ascendancy of the narrator's body parts occurs at exactly that moment when he surveys his environment while in motion. Drifting through the kitchen, he remarks how its objects glided by [<i>vorüberglitten</i>] him. Gliding [<i>gleiten</i>], phenomenologist Erwin Straus asserts, can be pleasurable, for it affords one the sense overcoming space. It also frightens, for it not only prevents the perceiving individual from differentiating space into discrete units but also continually "threaten[s] to become falling."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Gliding does not only preempt one's ability to perceive and therefore know one's self in the world, but it also modifies their relationship insofar as the body is perceived as belonging "to both 'bodily space' and 'external space.'"<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The narrator's pulling hands and pushing feet signal a shift whereby his body, which was otherwise an absent whole, becomes visible as a few select parts that join the object realm of other automated limbs. No longer an exclusive subject, he becomes aware of his own corporeal instability precisely because he is gliding. Motion deprives him of his mastery such that his body is perceived as being asunder from itself.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This fall from totality lasts momentarily, for the narrator restricts his movements during his three-day chronicle to an absolute minimum; his corporeal wholeness is largely contingent upon remaining still. Returning to the narrator's inversely proportional relationship with the doctor, the body for both of them is a point of departure for perceiving the world. Unlike the doctor, whose pain has brought about a blindness that prevents him from experiencing anything beyond his own disred body, the narrator's distance from the events and bodies he observes aids and abets his quest to perceive an intact world from his insides out. With respect to the overriding question of estrangement, the micro-novel's mysteriously displaced narrator exhibits with his ocular obsession both a self-awareness of the displaced body's lost wholeness and a pursuit to recover it. He ignores entirely the relevance of the doctor's afflictions for his own unstable condition.

From Visions to Shadows: The Quest for Wholeness
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The instability of the narrator's body and his mania for descriptions of other bodies point toward to an overriding phenomenal and corporeal economy in the text, a flow that continually pushes from part to whole. The desire to make a whole body out of its parts is most forcefully underscored in vignette three when the narrator is alone in his room and dedicates himself to the art of "Erdenken von Bildern," literally the conceiving of images (K, 18).<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  It is here where surrealist ways of seeing intrude into the phenomenological obsessions of Weiss's narrator. "For this," he reports, "I lie stretched out on the bed; within reach, beside me, on the table, there is a plate full of salt from which I occasionally take a few grains to put in my eyes. The function of the salt is to stimulate the tear glands and thus blur my vision" (C, 7). Far from merely blurring his vision, his experiments in altered perception dissolve the narrator's spatial confines entirely and conjure up illusions of unmitigated wholeness: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>directly below me . . . there gleamed a face as if in moonlight, yet there was no moon nor any stars, a face with thin cheekbones, a full, dark mouth, dark shaded eyes, and under the face a slim throat against the flowing hair, and under the edge of the throat the sharply outlined collar bone with the bare straight shoulders, and under the shoulders the bare breasts circumscribed by lines of shadows, with the black centers of the nipples, and under the breasts the ribs . . .</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(C, 7).
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">After seeing this apparition, the narrator admits that he "felt her nearness so strongly" that he "took the mirage for reality and made a hasty movement with [his] arms which immediately tore the image" (C, 7). Something deeply desired, this whole woman is a construct, a whole body carefully sutured together piece by piece, a metonymic string of signifiers that begins with the head and arrives at closure with the toe. Several scholars like Otto Best have insisted that this first of several visions is nothing less than the narrator's exploration of surrealist techniques for augmenting perception. Where Best describes this as the visual equivalent of surrealism's <i>écriture automatique</i>, others chalk the experiments up to the narrator's flight from reality, his escape into the dream, and a path towards wish fulfillment by the unconscious.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Indeed, the narrator's use of salt does evoke surrealism's pharmacokinetic methods for inducing what Walter Benjamin called "profane illumination," intoxications of thought to which hallucinogenic drugs could provide an "introductory lesson." Crucial differences exist, however, between the narrator's salt and Benjamin's hashish, the most salient of which being salt's inability to rupture psychochemically the rigid borders between "dreaming and waking states."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Compared to one of André Breton's trance-like experiences in which he perceived "a man walking cut half way up by a window perpendicular to the axis of his body," Weiss's narrator employs salt to accomplish the exact opposite.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Instead of closing his eyes and activating the realm of the unconscious to disclose a forbidden world of fantastic and random assemblages, he achieves with eyes wide open what he otherwise cannot: capturing the spectacle of a whole body. </p>

<p>Compared to his Sisyphean task of assembling quotidian reality into a whole, these solitary salt experiments are hardly a triumph. This failure to make "seeing into an occupation"

<b></b>

 comes to light in the novel's collages (C, 18). Ignored by scholars until very recently, the collages, which Weiss created five years after completing the text, exist in a twilight space between the ocularcentrism within the text and an extra-textual realm of images.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  If images, as Weiss would later declare in his cosmology of language, simultaneously convey all their components as a single totality, then the grid-like collages juxtaposed with particular narrative scenes announce that the totality seen is actually a collection of fragments.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Totality, like absolute transparency, is a fiction. In the lower left-hand corner of the first collage [<a href="#1">re 1</a>], just one page after the description of the apparition of a woman, a man in profile gazes through an optical device. By virtue of the other two related images positioned in his line of sight in the collage's far-right column, it is suggested that both apparatuses unveil what otherwise eludes the eye. As suggested by the prism in the lower right-hand corner and a camera lucida above it, both optical aids expose the individual elements that comprise larger natural phenomena (i.e., the dispersal of light into a spectrum). Like the rigid block grid that determines the relation between the collage's individual parts, these scientific instruments of reason reveal the hidden order in the visible world by unveiling the interdependency between part and whole.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Though the collage invokes the salt experiments from vignette three, it nevertheless questions the wholeness that the narrator takes to be real. The woman recounted in the text as a string of signifiers that begins with her head and face appears in the collage as being decapitated. With her abdomen and headless body positioned at the same implied depth of field (or column) as the prism and light projector, the collage infers the male gaze—unlike the scientific instruments—as being incapable of divining a whole from the sum of a woman's parts. Similarly, her head, although directly in the crosshairs of the male gaze, loses both detail and definition the farther the man's eye penetrates until it finally eclipses the head altogether. As his gaze travels from left to right, he wields a violence that severs the female body such that the remainder is only her <i>res extensa</i>. Unlike the unified whole in the salt vision, he beholds through his looking glass a headless female body, her abdomen singled out in the top-right corner but not yet penetrated by his eye. </p>

<p>This discord between text and collage is crucial, for not only does it make clear that the latter is not a mimetic illustration of the events unfurled in the former, but it also attests to the unresolved intermedial tensions in Weiss's avant-garde output throughout the fifties. With respect to the collage's status as image, it and not the narrator taps as meta-narrative agent into the anatomy lessons of surrealism, the most important of which is the fundamental nature of misrecognition in the identification with images. As Linda Williams points out, Jacques Lacan's linguistic revision of Freudian psychoanalysis—in particular his theory of the mirror stage—encapsulated and expounded upon the very same surrealist concerns about the purity of "nonverbal image-discourse" that culminated in surrealist writings like those of Antonin Artaud. Just as Artaud exposed "the image of the Other" as "a seductive illusion of wholeness," so too did Lacan insist that the narcissistic desire to equate the specular image of the Other with the self was a fiction. This misrecognition arises because the imaginary order in which such identifications transpire systemically deny the <i>a priori</i> presence of the symbolic.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Misrecognition is thus an inherent unawareness of Lacan's proposition that "The unconscious

<b></b>

 is structured like a language."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Once the illusion is eventually smashed, the subject—with only the linguistic structures of the symbolic at its disposal—desires to regain an originary sense of totality by literally stringing signifiers together "word to word and from line to line" into an interminable chain (C, 17). By throwing salt into his eyes, Weiss's narrator not only testifies to the centrality of misrecognition in his "attempts at writing" but also short circuits the nostalgic logic of metonymic desire as if to suggest that metonymy can attain fulfillment once and for all. Although firmly rooted in the visual registers of the prelinguistic imaginary, Weiss's collage counters this misrecognition by rupturing the myth of wholeness. Far from merely repeating surrealism's proto-psychoanalytic exercises, or even reconciling the body in pieces as a normative trans-historical condition, Weiss's collages deploy instances of the imaginary that are situated outside the false perceptions of the narrator in order to establish a basis on which to think through the limited binarism of fragmentation-versus-wholeness. Consumed by his desire to access the imaginary, the narrator fails to recognize at the micro-novel's close the proto-cinematic solution to his dilemma.</p>

<p>First mentioned in vignette two, the coachman of the micro-novel's title is absent until the final vignette. The climax of the novel, the penultimate scene in which the narrator sees shadows of the coachman and the housekeeper engaged in intercourse, 

<b></b>

stands out as the exceptional moment in the narrative in which bodies become whole: "Only the shadow of the raised hand of the housekeeper holding the coffeepot stuck out from the shapeless, condensed joining of the shadows of the bodies. The shadow of the coffeepot swayed back and forth, the shadow of the bodies also swayed back and forth; and now and then the shadow of the heads in profile, sticking close together, rose above the clump of bodies" (C, 37). Frequently interpreted as a spectacle that traumatizes the narrator, the sex scene actually leaves the narrator feeling "absolute[ly] indifferent" (C, 35).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  This indifference, which brings him to consider ending his writerly quest to transcend the "short, broken-off," arises because this "visual game" neither resembles the illusory outcome of his salt-induced visions, nor does it allow for the perpetual quest for wholeness through metonymy (C, 6).<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The shadows of the alien bodies he surveils do not correspond to his own desired specular image; while the bodies' shadows intermittently appear to have appendages, they fuse to form a corporeal mass discernible only as a blob that rocks back and forth. Indivisible and anatomically foreign, the "clump of bodies" exhibits a shadowy mass [<i>Schattenmasse</i>] solely in terms of its optical unity and forestalls any and all identification (K, 88). This is all the more astonishing given that this mere projection of silhouettes is nothing less than a cinematic experience: "I could see [ . . . ] the shadows falling from the kitchen window onto the ground in the yard while I was leaning out of my window inhaling the night air" (C, 37). Reading this rough replication of cinema as a manifestation of the imaginary, as Christian Metz might, is problematic. This screen does not reflect the ego ideal as a mirror does but rather distorts it. Similar to surrealist film in terms of its disruption of identification with the screen, this proto-filmic moment departs from surrealism's disinclination to distort the perceived image.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Ironically, it also contradicts Weiss's own assessment of surrealist film's greatest contribution to avant-garde cinema, which he articulated in 1956 in his study on the history of avant-garde film. Unlike Luis Buñuel's surrealist films that turned "away from the aestheticizing character" of earlier vanguard cinema, which merely played "with light and shadows" and exaggerated photographic "effects and technical finesse," the light show that closes <i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i> does exactly that.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  As if to suggest that the imaginary signifier must be jettisoned, the play of shadows proposes another sur-reality for identification, one that transcends the fiction of lost wholeness as instantiated by the virtual woman in the salt hallucinations as well as the misrecognition that accompanies her appearance. In place of these visions, the light show infers that the non-totalizing form of embodiment can be rectified by smashing the mirror and, with it, the blueprint for an ideal anatomy. Although the narrator fails to acknowledge the lessons in this accidental film—he leaves his last sentence without any closing punctuation as if to suggest that it must be continued—Weiss made non-totalizing corporeal assemblages comprised of non-contiguous body parts the centerpiece of his first mature avant-garde film.

The (Sur)Realist Solution: The Fragmented Body
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Filmed while he wrote <i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i>, Weiss's second film, "Studie II (Hallucinationer)" , is comprised of twelve scenes, each of which contains disparate nude male and female body parts that they rock, tilt, walk, wave, grasp, hoist, rotate, and quiver. Filmed with a static camera, each tableau vivant sets a markedly different group of body fragments against a black background. While they evoke in name the salt experiments from the micro-novel, the twelve hallucinations in the film have little in common with the narrator's instrumentalization of a dreamlike state. According to Weiss's own assessment of his film, each mise-en-scène was pieced together to create deformed "res" meant to evoke "strong erotically-tinged feelings" (A, 141).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In an interview with Harun Farocki many years later, Weiss insisted that the film's basis was a series of ink sketches of deformed and anatomically disproportionate bodies that "dealt with the exile situation," which he described as "dreamlike" and "traumatic."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Weiss's readings of the film, in which he underscores the themes of desire, deformed bodies, and the trauma of exile, intimates that his development from writer to filmmaker traveled full circle. As in the case of the micro-novel, the film displays Weiss's recurring predicament of bodies torn asunder. Unlike the novel, the film conceives loss as an interminable and irreversible condition. Taking the misrecognition at the micro-novel's close as its point of departure, the film also moves beyond the text's embrace of the imaginary as a visual means to recover linguistically the lost whole body. Assuming the text also represents the effects of trauma on the exilic body along with the drive to master, unsuccessfully, its concomitant fragmentation, the film marks a breakthrough for Weiss insofar as it radically subverts the foregoing object of desire. "Studie II" represents the apogee of Weiss's engagement with the broken body during his exile after exile, because it gives voice to a trauma whose effects his works cannot escape. </p>

<p>The film's first establishing shot [<a href="#2">re 2</a>] establishes vision and desire as the points of departure for the remaining eleven shots. This mise-en-scène is comprised of three distinct body formations, the most prominent being a male torso and head lying face up, its right arm raised in the air with a glass ball in hand. With a pair of legs atop his chest—feet pointed toward his head—the man stares at the ball carefully twirled in his hand. In his line of sight is an arm that protrudes from the right-hand perimeter of the frame, its hand opening and closing slowly. Behind the male's torso on the left hand side of the frame, a nude female in profile gazes into a mirror such that her visage is reflected toward the camera. A self-reflective acknowledgement of the imaginary and the illusion of the specular image, the woman-mirror arrangement echoes itself in the male head/torso-glass ball constellation insofar as both involve a scopic drive. Where the mirror illustrates the illusory constitution of an ego ideal, the glass ball—a perfect form—embodies wholeness <i>a priori</i>. Corporeal unity is made radically other by the glass ball. The proximity of the ball to the arm fragment is significant, for their stereoscopic juxtaposition in the male's line of sight suggests a relation; the ball the man twirls is inversely proportional to the spherical void outlined by the arm's flexing fingers. Called by Weiss the film's "tranquil mode," this shot establishes the falsity of 

<b></b>

the mirror and the absence of corporeal unity; the totality of the glass ball cannot be reproduced by what must remain fragmentary, the body in pieces.</p>

<p>Inferred in the second and third shots, the conceptual trajectory of "Studie II" reaches a plateau with shot four [<a href="#3">re 3</a>], in which four sets of body parts appear independent of one another. Peering downward into the frame, a face looks not at a second face in the opposite corner of the frame. This other face, set back farther into the depth of field, looks above and beyond a pair of hands that protrude from the right side of the frame and cut a herring on a plate with fork and knife. A foot rests on the geographical plane behind the plate. Situated in their own distinct position in the frame's three-dimensional composition, these body parts refrain from interpellating one another. The libidinal vectors from these gazes have no target and the potential objects of desire within the frame go unnoticed and unclaimed. The idea of <i>Unlust</i> that Weiss identified in this constellation must be taken literally as a negation of desire by arresting it with and in space. From the falseness of the initial mirror, "Studie II" progresses to suspend desire altogether and deems fractured embodiment unalterable. </p>

<p>"Studie II" continues with eight more conrations, four of which (numbers five, six, eight, and ten) document the reemergence of desire as an intrusion of the symbolic order into the initial dream of arrested desire. Shot nine, described by Weiss as a ration of "maturity and inner resistance," reiterates the suspension of desire in shots two through four. Shots seven, eleven, and twelve overlap in their preoccupation with sleeping res, the overriding topos of a film whose subtitle announces the coming of dreamlike hallucinations. Particularly striking because of their juxtaposition, shots

eleven and twelve reveal the nature of the screen in Weiss's film. If each individual mise-en-scène represents a dreamlike hallucination, and if the composition and trajectory of all the shots rupture—in the tradition of surrealist film—the illusions of the imaginary signifier such that fulfillment of desire is frozen, are these final shots not also a hallucinatory assault on the desire to sleep? If the dream, as Freud contends, is the fulfillment of the desire to sleep, are these surrealist-like dream-images of sleepers dreaming not a self-effacing move to disrupt the dream, a dream against dreaming? Scene eleven [<a href="#4">re 4</a>], labeled by Weiss a "lullaby," provides an answer. Comprised of two body assemblages, the tableaux depicts an arm protruding downward from the upper perimeter of the frame, the palm of its hand affixed to the left temple of a tightly framed man's head with eyes closed. Together the arm and head gyrate clockwise, while behind them a pair of legs rotates in the opposite direction. Inducing sleep, the title and composition suggest, assumes serene, machine-like rhythms. As with the previous shots, however, the assemblage of body parts must not be construed as a single composite form. The opposing directionality of the leg assemblage vis-à-vis the sleeping torso-arm aggregate makes clear that the sought-after dream of wholeness (which is induced by the fragmented body) cannot mask, let alone reverse, the unrelenting intrusion of bodily fragmentation. Not the cause but rather the symptom of what Lacan calls "something quite primary," the film's automatic limbs once again pit their on-screen dream against the body's desire for wholeness.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In effect, the film functionalizes traumatic symptoms—body parts—in order to approximate surrealist disruptions within the imaginary screen. The culmination of this is the twelfth and final shot [<a href="#5">re 5</a>],

<p class="continued">

the sole mise-en-scène in which just the symptom appears: atop a headless torso lies another legless and headless trunk with its back facing the camera. From underneath the torsos, two legs jut out to the left of the frame and from the bottom edge of the frame an arm rests, its fingers moving ever so slightly atop the torsos. A pile of mostly lifeless body parts, this shot elevates the screen as the exclusive subject of the dream. Described by Weiss as "drowning in loneliness and sleep," it infers this condition of the fragmented body to be a state of finitude. </p>

<p>Like every other tableaux in "Studie II," this final scene derives its affective impact not only from the severed bodies but also the depthlessness of the black background. Like the bodies they envelop, these voids carry meaning, albeit in a register that exceeds the empire of the eye. Lacan contends that just as the image screen conceals the real, it also points towards the real's existence. Along with its scenes of torn bodies—symptoms of lost corporeal wholeness—"Studie II" incorporates the return of the traumatic real as something unassimilable that persists beyond the fragmented body and the frame of representation. In his seminar on the gaze, Lacan speaks of the "stain" as the visible mark through which the traumatic real gazes and blinds the subject. In "Studie II" this stain exists exclusively within the realm of the audible. Performed and recorded by Weiss, the film's soundtrack is his first "experiment with the possibilities of a new acoustic world . . . of screeching, scratching, and clanking" (A, 143). The originality of Weiss's "noise of hallucinations" lies neither in its approximation of Pierre Schaeffer's <i>musique concrète</i>, for example, nor in its use in non-narrative film. Weiss's soundtrack is original because of its "acousmatic presence" and the lack that it signifies. Defined by Michel Chion as an offscreen sound that a film never traces visually back to its cause or source, the acousmatic in "Studie II" initially assumes a relationship with the bodies on screen.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The title shot [<a href="#6">re 6</a>], in which two sets of hands scratch away at the top of the frame, infers that this sound emanates from these fingers. This reciprocity quickly destabilizes as subsequent shots refrain from suturing image with sound. At one moment sounding from within the frame and in another from without it, the film's acousmatic noise ultimately originates from elsewhere, passes through the black voids in the open frame long enough to imply, briefly, a plausible correspondence with the image, and then moves on, reassuming sovereignty. The soundtrack's spatial voids—a simultaneous transcendence and omniscience—points to another space beyond, yet coterminous with the visible frame and affords it a voice. That this acousmatic sound in "Studie II" says nothing with language is crucial, for its high pitch and eerie timbre convey pure affect, a sense of the uncanny, if not horrific, that haunts the image. Cast within Lacan's linguistic schema, the "new acoustic world" in "Studie II" is the return of the real, the missed traumatic encounter that eludes the symbolic chain of meaning but nevertheless returns from beyond the image screen.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  This is the "stain" of exile, the original violence that tore the body asunder. </p>

<p>The subtitle of "Studie II" bears great significance. While Weiss, like Freud, conflated the visual distortions of dream work with the symptoms of psychoneuroses as homologous forms of regression from reality, hallucinations, as defined by Lacan (like Straus), belong to the dominion of psychoses and express themselves acoustically. For 

<b></b>

Lacan, the verbal hallucinations of the madman—voices that emanate from no one and nowhere—result when the barrier between reality and the real crumbles such that the real overflows reality. In this respect, the prefix "sur" in Weiss's surrealism is a poor fit. Surrealism's quest to disrupt and transcend reality, along with its dialectical resolution of boundaries between dreaming and waking, the conscious and unconscious, rationality and irrationality, misses Weiss's filmic project. "Studie II" abandons surrealism's dialectics of representation entirely. Just as the psychotic sees no difference between reality and the real, the film refrains from envisioning an alterity beyond its hermetically-sealed world of severed bodies. Weiss's post-fascist surrealist project is more realist than surrealist, for its dreams of fragmented bodies are entirely the product of historical traumas precipitated by fascism's violence. This is especially evident in the final tableau, in which the pile of bodies evokes unmistakable associations with the Holocaust's gruesome iconography. Given Weiss's preoccupation with exile, this conflation of psycho-phenomenal body fragmentation (as precipitated by displacement) and the savagery practiced in Nazi extermination camps might seem like self-indulgent conflation or, worse, a lapse into the "quietism of despair" common among zealous existentialists of the time. On the contrary, as Weiss established in his 1965 essay, "Meine Ortschaft," the cities and towns through which he passed as an exile all stood in singular opposition to the one place for which he, a European Jew, was meant: Auschwitz. "The living person who comes here from another world," he wrote of his late 1964 visit to Auschwitz, "possesses nothing other than his knowledge of facts, written reports, testimonies from witnesses. They are a part of his life, something he bears, but he can only apprehend that which befalls him."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  A foil with which to imagine the devastation of the Shoah and, conversely, an image with which to summate the corporeal fragmentation caused by forced displacement, exile and genocide are the recto and verso of a historical consciousness that Weiss would continue to designate the core of his work. Unlike his later literary and theatrical masterpieces that envisage historical narratives unfolding with respect to biographies, places, and events, Weiss's "Studie II" conceives of history visually in terms of its bodily effects. History, those originary forces that precipitated the dissociation of the human body in the first place, eludes the ocular empire entirely. Cast against Fredric Jameson's reading of Lacan's real as the diachronic dimension of history that transcends individual experience, the acousmatic presence in "Studie II" can be construed as a term limit in the film's engagement with the body. Not only does it accentuate the symptoms of trauma, but it also gives voice to the missing cause of that trauma, history.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Thus, "Studie II" imagines the conditions for working through trauma without realizing them. Locked into repetitive forms of acting-out (to which the desire for wholeness and the fragmentation of the body belong), the film nevertheless acknowledges a dimension beyond the synchronic realm of melancholy, a temporal space related to, yet different from it.

<p>In the eight years spent finding a publisher for his micro-novel, Weiss completed one full-feature, seven non-narrative, and five documentary films. In the late fifties, he began making collages, thought to be the final chapter of his early engagement with surrealism and the visual arts. With the micro-novel's publication in Germany, the loneliness of exile putatively ended. However, Weiss's literary return to Germany was anything but a homecoming. Initially published in 1960 in Franz Mon's compendium of postwar modernism, <i>movens</i>, vignettes seven and eight, which peak with the narrator's visit to the self-mutilating doctor, were to illustrate what Mon heralded as modernism's postwar "dialectic between the whole and the singular." Mon insisted that the works in his collection illustrated that the "artistic articulation" of symbol and reality can approach and approximate epistemologically the transcendental wholeness of the "thing itself," otherwise beyond the realm of everyday perception.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Weiss's micro-novel, especially this excerpt about the radical segmentation of the body, does not exemplify any such dialectical resolution. Contrary to Mon's assertions, the novel fails to acknowledge a dialectics of wholeness that Weiss's avant-garde film debunks. In a similar misappropriation, Walter Höllerer incorporated Weiss in a 1964 double-issue of the journal <i>Akzente</i>. The volume purported to assemble works by writers whom Höllerer considered the contemporary heirs to the historical avant-garde.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Grouped under Höllerer's rubric "change" [<i>Veränderung</i>], Weiss was included to illustrate a new breed of writing, one that disposed with the perception and memory of an increasingly specious everyday reality. The volume's roster of international writers was intended to demonstrate the power to negate the trivial and construct absolute modes of perception. Weiss's reinvention of surrealism was worlds apart from Höllerer's vision of a renewed avant-garde. The original violent moment that brought Weiss's project into being came from without and, given its traumatic constitution, prevented any such constructive impulse. As "Studie II" makes clear, the valuable legacies of surrealism after fascism lay in the ability to interrogate and arrest the desire for wholeness, to imagine the traumatic dissociation of the body as interminable, and to begin grasping the body in pieces vis-à-vis the history that violated it. </p>

This articulation of Chion's theory with Lacanian psychoanalysis is modeled after: Slavoj Zizek, "The Real and its Vicissitudes," <i>Looking Awry: An Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture</i> (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1991), 40. The acoustic realm in "Studie II" shares little with its representation in the micro-novel. Although the narrator relies on sound to imagine the space beyond the visual, what he "sees" synesthetically is always transcribed back into the visual (and linguistic) as something knowable. This is not the case in the film. </p>
