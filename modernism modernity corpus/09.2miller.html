<p>
As terms that share their provenance in the cultural upheavals of the
first half of the twentieth century, "modernism" and "documentary"
nevertheless appear to belong to distinct art- historical, literary,
and aesthetic domains. As we have come to understand them, they seem
to indicate opposed sets of beliefs about the nature of artistic
communication, to embody different assumptions about the artwork's
public role, and in many cases to represent strongly divergent political
commitments on the part of their practitioners. Modernist artists and
writers, as commonplace has it, attacked the conventions of mimetic
visual and literary representation, laying bare the semiotic, social,
and psychological conventions that allowed traditional artworks to be
seen as verisimilar pictures of reality. Modernists interrogated the
ways in which subjective perception and thought mediated any possible
apprehension of the world, and they sought to account for the decisive
material role that media such as language, paint, and bodily movement
played in articulating the artwork's relation to reality. From this basic
stance of modernist artists, ultimately, derived many of the defining
features of the modernist artwork: its tendency towards difficulty,
fragmentation, and abstraction; its self-reflexivity and heightened
self-consciousness; its prominent display of artistic technique; its
polemical, often mandarin withdrawal from everyday life and culture.

<p>
Documentary, in contrast, seemed to draw its energy and inspiration from
the antithetical realm of the everyday, the popular world upon which
modernist art and writing had demonstratively

<b></b>

turned its back. In reportage, reports, photographs, and films, the
documentary artist attempted to register the teeming multiplicity of
movements of labor, daily routine, and city life. Honesty, accuracy,
and openness to the contingent details of the empirical world were
premium values in the documentary aesthetic, and objectively existing
"reality" its formal touchstone. In pursuing its goal of representing
reality truly, documentary took up the aspirations of nineteenth-century
artists, both realist and naturalist, to reveal the face of the common
life that less rigorous modes of art tended to mask. Documentary,
in sum, is frequently thought to represent the furthest development
of naturalism in the arts, just as modernism, its aesthetic antipode,
is seen as the acme of anti-naturalist impulses.

<p>
This story is familiar to the point of near-banality, and like most
folk wisdom, it has the virtue of being plausible if not precisely
true. Once it is given closer scrutiny, however, several problems nag
this account. First, evidently, the basic terms upon which it rests
are unstable and difficult to define with precision: for example, the
opposition of modernism's "subjectivity" to documentary's "objectivity,"
and of "modernism" itself to the "realism" and/or "naturalism" with which
documentary is aligned. It is pertinent to recall here Roman Jakobson's
terminological scruples concerning the multiple senses of "realism"
and easy to concur with him that "those who speak of artistic realism
continually sin against it."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Yet I want to pursue a somewhat different line of theoretical
 and historical argument than such terminological skepticism. In
 the conceptual frameworks taking shape around both modernism and
 documentary, I wish to suggest, formally innovative experimentalism
 and naturalistic explorations of everyday life were not so much
 opposed as instead <i>complementary</i> moments of a broader modernist
 poetics. Only from this perspective, I argue, do the mixtures of radical
 montage, reportage, state- or commercially-oriented advertising,
 and surrealist defamiliarization in the documentary works of John
 Grierson's filmmaking team and the texts of Mass Observation reveal
 their underlying coherence. Similarly, such a perspective, which implies
 that documentary arose in close relation to the later development of
 modernism in the late 1920s and 1930s, helps explain the significant
 presence of modernist writers, visual artists, and musicians in the
 documentary film movement and the amateur ethnographic organization
 called Mass Observation.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 These movements involved such modernistically oriented writers as
 Charles Madge, David Gascoyne, William Empson, Kathleen Raine,
 Naomi Mitchison, W.H. Auden, and even E.M. Forster; artists,
 photographers, and experimental filmmakers such as Humphrey Jennings,
 Julian Trevelyan, Humphrey Spender, and Len Lye; and musicians such
 as Benjamin Britten. On the part of those modernists not directly
 associated with the institutions of documentary, documentary culture
 was nevertheless followed with intense interest. For example, journals
 such as <i>Close-Up</i>, which involved such writers as H.D., Bryher,
 and Dorothy Richardson, offered readers critical discussions of
 Vertov's and Eisenstein's most recent productions. Similarly, Eugene
 Jolas's Paris-based expatriate journal <i>transition</i> set stills
 from Paul Strand's <i>Nets</i> and L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy's
 <i>English Zoo Architecture</i> alongside the latest installments of
 Joyce's <i>Work in Progress</i>, translations of stories and poems by
 Franz Kafka and Gottfried Benn, and visual works by Joan Mir&ograve;
 and Marcel Duchamp.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
A useful theoretical point of departure for considering the
interconnections of modernism and documentary is the writings of the
communist philosopher and literary critic, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, one of
the most important critics of modernism and a formidable advocate of
classical and socialist realism. In his 1958 study, <i>The Meaning of
Contemporary Realism</i>, Luk&aacute;cs identifies the first "modernistic"
break with realism&#8212;in his view, regrettable&#8212;not with the
manifestly modernist writings of Kafka, Joyce, Benn, and Musil, but
already a generation or two earlier, with the naturalism of Zola. He goes
on to attack critics who glorify modernism, damning them for failing to
distinguish between realism and naturalism. He writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->. . . this distinction depends on the presence or absence
in a work of art of a "hierarchy of significance" in the situations
and characters presented. Compared with this, formal categories are
of secondary importance. That is why it is possible to speak of the
basically <i>naturalistic</i> character of modernist literature . . . the
particular form this principle of naturalistic arbitrariness, this lack
of hierarchic structure, may take is not decisive. We encounter it in
the all-determining "social conditions" of naturalism, in symbolism's
impressionist methods and its cultivation of the exotic, in the
fragmentation of objective reality in futurism and constructivism and
the German <i>NeueSachlichkeit</i>, or, again, in surrealism's stream
of consciousness.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Rather than dismissing Luk&aacute;cs's naturalism-modernism continuum as
a dark night in which all cows are gray or accepting his anti-modernist
evaluative spin, I wish to explore his hypothesis somewhat against the
grain of his intentions and to draw out its implications. Luk&aacute;cs's
pinpointing of the "basically naturalistic character of modernist
literature," I suggest, offers a way to understand modernism and
documentary as complementary and, at the same time, helps reveal
the ambivalence within documentary poetics between "realist" social
representation and "naturalistic-modernistic" erosion of this
representational "hierarchy of significance."

<p>
Luk&aacute;cs's critique hinges on the key role of socially significant
"types" in realism and the displacement of typicality in both naturalism
and modernism, through the hypostatization of the particular and
the detail. He develops this argument by way of commentary on Walter
Benjamin's theory of allegory, which he takes as reflecting modernism's
ideologically conditioned failure to grasp the real as rational, from
the perspective of a substantive totality (represented for Luk&aacute;cs
by official communist Marxism):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In realistic literature each descriptive detail is both <i>individual</i>
and <i>typical</i>. Modern allegory and modernist ideology, however,
deny the <i>typical</i>. By destroying the coherence of the world,
they reduce detail to the level of mere particularity (once again,
the connection between modernism and naturalism is plain). Detail,
in its allegorical transferability, though brought into a direct, if
paradoxical connection with transcendence, becomes an abstract function of
the transcendence to which it points. Modernist literature thus replaces
concrete typicality with abstract particularity.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A remark by Luk&aacute;cs's heterodox Soviet contemporary, Viktor
Shklovsky, associated with the left modernist groups "Lef" and "New Lef"
in the 1920s, suggests that one

<b></b>

could employ this basic distinction even without endorsing Luk&aacute;cs's
prescriptive demand to suppress modernism and reconstruct realism. Thus,
in a symposium on Soviet documentary in 1927, which included Sergei
Tretiakov, Esther Shub, Osip Brik, and Shklovsky, the formalist literary
critic and screenplay writer appealed to a historical dialectic of
modernist form and naturalistic actuality of content to establish the
tasks of current Soviet film. Rather than such typical oppositions
as fiction and non-fiction or, by extension, realist and modernistic
treatment of the film narrative, Shklovsky emphasized the intensive
engagement with new "raw material" as that which would advance Soviet
film work in both its aesthetic character and its social function:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What Shub is doing and Dziga Vertov is getting ready to do has a huge
number of analogies in literature . . . We should not exaggerate the
fictional side of art. The fact of fiction is established, but art
periodically undergoes a re-emphasis on raw material. And the mistaken
newsreel-makers were right about this and they are right now when they
promote raw material. The priority of material is the result . . . Lef's
task is broader than the problem of the fiction and non-fiction film. Our
problem is the priority of raw material.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Shklovsky thus saw the documentary film in the same broadly modernistic
framework as he viewed literature in his formalist criticism.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Filmic expression, documentary and fictional, he was arguing, needed
 regular freshening through "defamiliarizing" means. These means
 included <i>both</i> new stylistic "devices" and the disturbing force
 of up-to-date, often "low" social contents appropriated directly from
 extra-artistic domains ("raw materials"). Or to put it more abstractly,
 in Shklovsky's theory of literary and filmic innovation, "modernistic"
 and "naturalistic" impulses appear equally valuable and complementary,
 not antithetical.

<p>
In his review of Paul Rotha's book <i>Documentary Film</i> for the 19
February, 1936, issue of <i>The Listener</i>, W. H. Auden specifically
pointed to precisely the problem of the "realistic" typical narratives
and "naturalistic-modernistic" particulars as an unresolved tension
in the documentary form. Indeed, in an almost Luk&aacute;csian fashion
(though terminologically more loose), Auden drew out the contradictions
between two forms of "realism": realism as verisimilitude and realism
as close mimetic reproduction of real things. He begins: "The only
genuine meaning of the word 'documentary' is true-to-life. Any gesture,
any expression, any dialogue or sound effect, any scenery that strikes
the audience as true-to-life is documentary, whether obtained in the
studio or on location."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 He goes on to note, however, that "because of the irreversibility and
 continuous unvaried movement of the film, it is not the best medium
 for factual information . . . The effect of a film is to create a
 powerful emotional attitude towards the material presented" ("DF,"
 355). Finally, he notes, "because of the mass of realistic detail which
 the camera records, no medium has ever been invented which is so well
 suited to portray individual character, and so badly suited to the
 portrayal of types. On the screen you never see <i>a</i> man digging in
 <i>a</i> field, but always Mr. Macgregor digging in a ten acre meadow"
 ("DF," 355).

<p>
Although Auden does not fully spell out the consequences of his critical
caveats to the documentary aesthetic, his implication is clear enough. On
the one hand, insofar

<b></b>

as the term "documentary" lays claim to the verisimilitude of classical
realism, it must give up its adherence to a photographically grounded
naturalism which captures events in real time and on location (since
true-to-life "documentary" representations could just as easily be
made in the studio). Yet insofar as the documentarists insisted on
the precise registration of details, especially photographically and
cinematographically, they verged over into the emotionally intense, often
surreal depiction of the autonomous fragment of reality characteristic of
radical naturalism and modernism alike. Rotha himself, it should be noted,
argued strongly against the tendency of the documentary mode to fragment
into striking details, thus taking on modernistic, aestheticizing features
to the detriment of its social function. Accordingly, he criticized
"Continental Realists" such as Walter Ruttmann and Dziga Vertov for their
"superficial," "pseudo-realist" treatment of the rhythms and movements
of the city, and he rejected conventional visual beauty in favor of a
new aesthetic of factuality and social aim:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Beauty is one of the greatest dangers to documentary. Beauty of
individual shots is not only insufficient but frequently harmful to
the significant expression of content. Beauty of purely natural things. . . is unimportant unless related to purpose and theme. Beauty of
symphonic and rhythmic movement is . . .nothing in itself. What is
important is beauty of idea, fact, and achievement, none of which have
anything to do with the actual filming of individual shots.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet Rotha's polemic, whatever the merits of his position, at the same time
points to the precise sore spot that Auden touched upon. The documentary,
Rotha and Auden imply, is potentially torn between two basic aesthetic
tendencies: a "realist" typicality that allows the documentary to be
"true-to-life" and hence socially functional; and a naturalistic or
modernist particularity of the photographically rendered detail, which
threatens to overrun verisimilitude in favor of the effective emotional
or aesthetic impact of the image.

<p>
One of the most apparent sites in which one can observe this tense
complementarity of modernist and documentary modes is the new prose
poem genre that emerged in the 1930s in the work of writers involved
with the documentary and Mass Observation movements. Broadly speaking,
this prose poem was surrealist in its inspiration, yet this surrealism
was in turn decisively shaped by these writers' idiosyncratic reading of
the documentary aesthetic, particularly their filtering of it through
Marcel Duchamp's use of everyday objects in his "readymades." Kathleen
Raine, in assessing the successes and failures of the Mass Observation
movement, has suggested that it provided a point of convergence between
the rational and the irrational, the objective and the dream-like in a
single fund of images. She went on to single out David Gascoyne, along
with Charles Madge and Humphrey Jennings, as Mass Observation participants
who had realized a poetry based on such a convergence, "in which an
imagery of precise and objective realism, gathered from the daily human
(and therefore especially urban) scene . . . is informed with a content
not only supremely imaginative, but infused with the imagination of the
collective mind of which it is an eloquent, if unconscious, expression."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Raine, no doubt, has in mind particularly the "reports" of Jennings and

<b></b>

Madge and the analogous prose poetry of Gascoyne. There are, however,
significant differences between these three poets' work within the
basic genre of the surrealist prose poem&#8212;differences that relate
closely to how they interpret the conjunction of surrealism, readymade,
and document, which spans their poetic and documentary activities. In what
follows, I will consider in greater detail the work of these three poets
and documentary artists, concluding with a discussion of the analogous
writing of a fourth artist, the filmmaker and animator Len Lye.

<p>
In September of 1937, Humphrey Jennings&#8212;poet, documentary filmmaker,
surrealist painter, and founding member of the fledgling ethnographic
movement Mass Observation&#8212;was charged with the task of writing
up the results of the surveys and reports done by the Mass Observers on
the recent events of Coronation Day, 12 May. Typical of these reports,
in both the scene observed and the style in which it is presented,
was the following, out of London:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Lancaster Gate. 2.20. Kensington Garden shut, full of soldiers, girls
leaning over park railings calling to them, soldiers indicate guards at
gate despairingly. Indians arguing in tube about the necessity of the
Bakerloo extension to Stanmore, one says, "People in suburbs are scarcely
human, they should be kept as far out of London as possible." Every time
train enters tunnel people make animal noises. Others unscrew light-bulbs;
they are all doing the sort of things Undergraduates do when canned,
but they are not Undergraduates, they seem to be aged between about 25
and 35 and they look like clerks, typists, etc. Terrific jam at Oxford
Circus, takes about 15 minutes to get up escalators. Singing coming from
every part of Oxford Street. Fruit barrows, sellers of rosettes and
newpapers, no motors. People camping on the pavement all the way down
Regent Street, four deep from the pavement edge. Young man to girls,
"Hey, have you got to go home tonight?"&#8212;This seems to be the most
frequent question asked, answer always in the negative; apparently even
in moments of great excitement people are still thinking of their homes
as their centres of life.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This report appeared along with hundreds of others in the Mass Observation
edited volume <i>May the Twelfth</i>, published under the prestigious
Faber and Faber imprint. Presented as a slice of life captured in a
moment of intense "actuality," it bristles with paratactic energies and
estranges the banal urban landscape with surreal bundles of isolated
sights, sounds, faces, and voices. About a year before the Coronation
Day events, Jennings had published another report, the first of the
three short paragraphs collected together under the generic title
"Three Reports":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The conditions for this race, the most important of the Classic races
for three-year old fillies, were ideal, for the weather was fine and
cool. About one o'clock the Aurora again appeared over the hills in a
south direction presenting a brilliant mass of light. Once again Captain
Allison made a perfect start, for the field was sent away well for the
first time that they approached the tapes. It was always evident that
the most attenuated light of the

<b></b>

Aurora sensibly dimmed the stars, like a thin veil drawn over them. We
frequently listened for any sound proceeding from this phenomenon,
but never heard any.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the Mass Observation report, however, this text appeared in a
literary magazine, in the "Double Surrealist Number" of the journal
<i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i>.

<p>
Both passages lay claim to the genre of "report," which suggests a
correlation between the order of the text and the order of events and a
descriptive fidelity to a real situation witnessed by an observer. The
Mass Observation report, for all its paratactical disjointedness, is a
coherent fragment of urban experience, a temporally and spatially limited,
perspectival view of an extraordinary event. Whatever broader context or
narrative completion might be possible for any individual bit, it will
receive from the organized accumulation of other reports&#8212;from
"more than two hundred observers" in London, Lancashire, Cambridge,
Swansea and elsewhere&#8212;and from the editorial synthesis seeking
to frame the individual reports into a verbal mosaic of collective
experience. In contrast, Jennings's poetic report on the horserace has
little of the telegraphic breakup of narrative and syntax found in the
observer's rapid jottings. Its diction seems contrivedly literary and a
little dated: "It was always evident that the most attenuated light of the
Aurora sensibly dimmed the stars, like a thin veil drawn over them." Yet
the difficulties the text poses us as readers are far greater than the
fractured report of the Coronation Day observer&#8212;basic difficulties
of context and significance, of the very status of the text generically
and ontologically.

<p>
Jennings's prose poem appeared among several other instances in the same
special surrealist number of <i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i>. For
example, immediately preceding Jennings's reports were four prose works
of various characters and qualities. First came a page-long excerpt
from Andr&eacute; Breton's and Paul Eluard's collaborative work of
surrealist automatism, "The Pre-Natal Life of Man" (an excerpt from
<i>L'Immacul&eacute;e conception</i>).
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 This text is followed by a surrealist "Story" about a dog, a ghost,
 and lepers by the Breton proteg&eacute;e Gis&egrave;le Prassinos. Then
 appear "An Adventure" written by "A Five-Year-Old Boy" and "The Tea
 Party" by "A Seven-Year-Old Girl." Finally, immediately following
 Jennings's "Three Reports" is a screenplay by the surrealist filmmaker
 Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, "The Giraffe." According to the script, this film
 is to consist of a giraffe cut out of wood in life-sized profile,
 with each spot hiding a lid that can be opened onto things visible
 "behind" the spots.

<p>
By comparison, then, to the Mass Observation report of 12 May which has
been quoted above, Jennings's "Three Reports" shares no common reference
with those prose texts surrounding it and thus obviously forms no larger
unit of narrative meaning with them. Yet there is a common feature binding
these various texts of Breton, Bu&ntilde;uel, Prassinos, Jennings, and the
anonymous children: the <i>generic</i> inclusiveness of the surrealist
prose poem. Drawing inspiration from a heterogeneous set of influences,
ranging from precursors such as Rimbaud, Lautr&eacute;amont, and Roussel
to Freudian dream-texts and flea-market kitsch, this genre can embrace
oneiric narrative, found objects, irrational juxtapositions, satirical
mimicry of outmoded books, dysfunctional machines, and distortions of
textual logic introduced through chance and automatic

<b></b>

practices. Jennings himself appears to have understood this generic
consistency&#8212;despite his prose poems' lack of narrative, thematic,
and referential cohesion&#8212;insofar as he projected a larger collection
ironically suggesting "reportage": the August-September 1936 issue of
<i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i> carried an advertisement promising
a book by Jennings entitled <i>Popular Narratives</i>, while in another
announcement in the December 1936 issue it bore the projected title
<i>Reports and Photographs</i>. It was to have appeared in spring of
1937 in their special editions series, but the plan was not realized
before the journal folded with the autumn 1937 number.

<p>
Jennings's "reports" are puzzling so long as we are seeking to make
them "reports of" something and do not see that these are "reports" to
be viewed as objects whose referential or functional aspects have been
rendered ambiguous, though not fully effaced. These texts, as Kathleen
Raine pointed out in her preface to Jennings's posthumous collected poems,
can be seen as akin to Marcel Duchamp's appropriation and reinscription
of readymade domestic objects.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 In this light, Jennings's reports appear less like the rapid jottings
 of a witness on the spot than like pages torn out of old books and
 reframed into "poems in prose"&#8212;that literary genre in which
 Duchamp recognized a detouring of poetry akin to his own deflection
 of painting through a "delay in glass."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>


<h3>

<p>
Jennings's "readymade" report-poems found a resonance with two other
poets, Charles Madge, with whom Jennings would help to found the Mass
Observation venture, and the British surrealist poet David Gascoyne
(also involved in Mass Observation). Madge, like Jennings, was a regular
contributor to <i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i> and had presided
over the special feature on surrealism in the December 1933 issue of
Geoffrey Grigson's journal <i>New Verse</i>, to which he contributed
a programmatic essay, "Surrealism for the British." Madge argued that
British artists and writers should not merely imitate a Parisian fashion
that was already a decade old by the time it was being discovered in
Britain; rather they should adapt the lessons of surrealism in light of
the national particularities of the English language, literary tradition,
and daily culture.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 One direction in which Madge took this basic orientation was
 anthropological: the observation of the British en masse, to learn about
 the unknown rituals, magical modes of thought, taboos, and wish-images
 which were rooted in the everyday life of this industrial nation. In
 a letter of 30 January, 1937, to <i>The New Statesman and Nation</i>
 entitled "Anthropology at Home," Charles Madge and Humphrey Jennings,
 together with the anthropologist and ornithologist Tom Harrisson,
 set forth their program to understand the British and their peculiar
 collective rites:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Mass Observation develops out of anthropology, psychology, and the
sciences which study man&#8212;but it plans to work with a mass of
observers . . . The following are a few examples of problems that
will arise:
<br />
<blockquote>
Behavior of people at war memorials.
<br />
Shouts and gestures of motorists.

<b></b>
<br />
The aspidistra cult.
<br />
Anthropology of football pools.
<br />
Bathroom behaviour.
<br />
Beards, armpits, eyebrows.
<br />
Anti-semitism.
<br />
Distribution, diffusion and significance of the dirty joke.
<br />
Funerals and undertakers.
<br />
Female taboos about eating.
<br />
The private lives of midwives.
</blockquote>
<br />
In these examples the anthropological angle is obvious, and the
description is primarily of physical behaviour. Other inquiries involve
mental phenomena which are unconscious or repressed, so that they can only
be traced through mass-fantasy and symbolism as developed and exploited,
for example, in the daily press. The outbreak of parturition-images in
the press last October may have been seasonal, or may have been caused
by some public stimulus: continuous watch on the shifting popular images
can only be kept by a multitude of watchers.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Two things are notable about Madge's and Harrisson's list. First is the
almost Swiftian distance from which the British people are surveyed,
training on the domestic front the detached gaze of the anthropologist
on an exotic people. Second, the features that are seen as providing
privileged points of entry into the British collective character are
an incongruous&#8212;indeed, "surreal"&#8212;heap: a kind of categorial
<i>Merzbau</i> assembled out of the detritus of everyday life, newpaper
fads, kitsch, body culture, leisure, and consumerism.

<p>
Like Jennings, Madge also detoured the activity of documentary finding
and reporting through the literary practice of the prose poem. Jennings
had juxtaposed his found fragments of texts, his secondhand "reports,"
in order to estrange the claim to reality of the document and to release
its aura of outmodedness and oneiric meaning. Jennings's adoption of the
"readymade" model moved it distinctly towards the <i>hermeneutic</i>
concerns of surrealism rather than the cool, derisive mechanization of
Duchamp's "pseudo-machines" (as Jennings called them). David Mellor
suggests that Jennings, akin to his exiled German counterpart Walter
Benjamin, was seeking to find in urban, mass media, and commodity culture
the dream- and wish-hieroglyphics of a collective unconscious.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Jennings had translated Andr&eacute; Breton's "Lighthouse of the
 Bride" essay on Duchamp for the 1936 Surrealist Exhibition in
 London, and in his text "The Iron Horse" for the 1938 exhibition
 "The Impact of Machines" he presents Duchamp's work as an artistic
 <i>counterdiscourse</i> to the machine: "The so-called 'abstract'
 painter identifies himself or the person in his picture with a machine
 . . . Not to be confused with abstract painting is the anti-artistic
 creation of pseudo-machines by Duchamp, Picabia, Ernst, Baargeldt,
 Man Ray."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Jennings goes on to juxtapose a note from Duchamp about the <i>Large
 Glass</i> to a letter written by James Watt in 1769 about the Kinneil
 Engine, concluding with a distinction: "The point of creating
 pseudo-machines was not as an exploitation of machinery but as a
 'profanation' of 'Art' parallel to the engineers' 'profanation' of
 the primitive 'sacred places' of the earth."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Yet the artist-engineer, in this view, retains a residual connection
 with the sacred as well&#8212;like a

<b></b>

modern magician presiding over the final descent of magic into
profane life. In contrast, Madge, who in the inaugural pamphlet of Mass
Observation praised Duchamp for having achieved the leap from modernist
to scientist, seemed especially attracted to the estranging quality
of things presented through the affectless voice of the scientist and
technical specialist.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
Compared to Jennings's "Reports," the prose poems included in Madge's
first collection of poems, <i>The Disappearing Castle</i>, appear
more directly to mimic the reports of biologists, social scientists,
geographers and surveyors, and journalists. In some cases, as with the
"Landscape" series, the poems and their titles together seem to represent
labelled "specimens" of prose, found in prospecting within the discursive
spaces of a specialized discipline.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Thus, for example, in "Landscape IV," the landscape evoked is more
 like a depiction in a geology textbook than an actually observed
 geological formation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Caverns may be divided into three classes. Some have the form of large
clefts or crevices, like veins not filled with ore. Other caverns are
open to the light at both ends. These are rocks really pierced; natural
galleries which run through a solitary mountain. A third form exhibits a
succession of cavities, placed nearly on the same level, running in the
same direction, and communicating with each other by passages of greater
or less breadth. Their almost perfect horizontality, their gentle and
uniform slope, appears to be the result of a long abode of the waters,
which enlarge by erosion clefts already existing. They act in the economy
of nature as vast reservoirs of water, and of elastic fluids.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In other cases, the title operates like a kind of Duchampian pun,
taking the appropriated prose object through the delay of its remapping
onto another referent, order of categories, and hierarchy of values
(for example, Duchamp's inversion of a urinal into the visual-verbal pun
"Fountain"). In Madge's poem "Division of Labour," for example, the title
has theoretical overtones from Karl Marx and &Eacute;mile Durkheim, as
well as connotations of industrialism and technical organization. Yet in
the poem, the technicity exists solely at the level of discursive style,
rather than in the object portrayed:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Alpine marmots are said to act in concert in the collection of
materials for the construction of their habitations. Some of them, we are
told, cut the herbage, others collect it into heaps; a third set serve
as waggons to carry it to their holes; while a fourth perform all the
functions of draught horse. The manner of the latter part of the curious
process is this. The animal who is to serve as the waggon lies down on
his back, and extending his four limbs as wide as he can, allows himself
to be loaded with hay; and those who are to be the draught horse trail him
thus loaded by the tail, taking care not to overset him. The task of thus
serving as the vehicle, being the least enviable part of the business,
is taken by every one of the party in turn. "I have often," says Mr
Beauplan, in his <i>Description of the Ukraine</i>, "seen them practise
this, and have had the curiosity to watch them at it for days together."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Juxtaposing the found prose with its suggestive title, Madge sets in
oscillation the apparently opposed poles of nature and technology,
inviting us to see our own industrial organization as a form of
"metabolism with nature." Industrial workers, implicitly, are

<b></b>

reduced by the industrial system to a level in which they become
comparable to industrious rodents; indeed, the organization of the
rodents seems much more "humane" and equitable than the putatively
human form. Their system is strikingly close to the ideal of communism,
a connotation further reinforced by the contrived name of the cited expert
("Mr. Beauplan," or "beautiful plan") and the location of his scientific
fieldwork in the Ukraine.

<p>
Jennings, as I have noted, emphasizes the auratic quality of the outmoded
found text, while Madge draws satirical and critical resources from
the estranged coolness of technical and journalistic language. David
Gascoyne, in turn, seeks to turn the prose poem into a fantastic,
oneiric object itself, abandoning the Duchampian problematic of the
readymade in favor of surrealist expressiveness. The most striking point
at which this distinction can be seen is precisely in Gascoyne's most
explicit attempt to assimilate the lessons of Jennings's "reports," in
the prose poem sequences entitled "Automatic Album Leaves" and "Three
Verbal Objects." In his introduction to his <i>Collected Poems</i>,
Gascoyne notes that "Three Verbal Objects" were:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->. . . first published in the catalogue to an Exhibition
of Surrealist Objects at the London Gallery in the winter of 1937, by
which time I had moved to a Paris attic and virtually ceased writing in
the surrealist vein. They are posthumously dedicated to Humphrey Jennings,
in acknowledgement of the influence that his "Reports" and other admirable
short texts, first published by Roger Roughton in <i>Contemporary Poetry
andProse</i>, undoubtedly had on me.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Gascoyne's sincere appreciation of Jennings's pieces, however, cannot
obscure the enormous difference in the fundamental modes between
Jennings's anachronistic sounding found prose fragments and the visionary
lyricism of Gascoyne's "verbal objects." For Gascoyne, the "objecthood"
of the verbal passage does not mean that the language has been subjected
to a dissolution of its narrative and referential codes, but rather just
the opposite: their rematerialization as an enduring ritual, mythic,
or cosmic entity. Similarly, whereas Jennings's "reports" suggest
the disturbing role of chance in historical life, the contingency and
partiality of our documentary comprehension of events, Gascoyne envisions
an apocalyptic reversal of meanings, symbolically portrayed through images
in which violent destruction is transred into cosmic signs of rebirth:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
From the tower of a quietly blazing mansion whirled a flock of doves,
and the smell of their half-scorched feathers became confused with the
scent of the countless damp and trampled plants that lay a-rotting on
the terraces. And the sky flung a column of wind like a wide-flung scarf
into the distance, where the earth was turning on its never-ending hinge.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast to Jennings's and Madge's use of found prose to fold aspects
of context back into their poetic texts, Gascoyne's prose-poetry, though
skillful and symbolically dense,

<b></b>

lends itself to a fairly conventional exegesis. The burning mansion
suggests a revolutionary attack on the ruling classes, with the
half-scorched doves being images of the beauty that resided in these
luxurious houses, released through a violence that liberates but
scars them. The rotting plants suggest the moribund nature of these
aristocratic houses, the stagnancy and inability of the wealthy to
sustain any genuine life. And on the horizon of change&#8212;the edge
of the turning world&#8212;the sky seems to lift a banner in approval
and to communicate the demand for revolution worldwide.

<p>
The sequence "Automatic Album Leaves" diverges just as greatly from
the "reports" of Jennings and Madge, even though its title suggests
the second-order representation that characterized their use of found
prose. The modifier "automatic" has particular connotations in the
surrealist vocabulary which suggest the very opposite of the usual sense
of mechanical and habitual. For Andr&eacute; Breton, psychic automatism
was intended to express the spontaneity and secret processes of the
unconscious in a fashion as uncensored and directly transcribed as
possible. Thus, in Gascoyne's poem, the title functions as an inventive
catachresis: the free-ranging "automatism" of the unconscious mind
struggling against the confining limits and "cut-out" character of the
"album leaf." The tensions of this poem, in fact, show Gascoyne at
his best; the diminutiveness and delicacy of the form help tame his
propensity towards bathos, while he is able within these tiny frames to
dance playfully across registers of language and rhetorical modes. For
example, in the fifth "leaf," he animates with charming wit the crumbs
left on a plate or table:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
How historic and full of resonance are these crumbs! With their delightful
bell-shaped dresses and their little heads like daggers they are capable
of performing all kinds of aquatic tricks, such as high-life bicycling and
shoe-blacking, and they are able to peer down at leisure into the great
globe that stands in the garden. That they are energetic and truthful I
can only guess, but that their music is sweeter than parsley basins or
mesmeric influences I am certain. Observe the way they glide out of the
churches, lifting their skirts with lobster-like delicacy, watch how
carefully they transform themselves into Japanese plants and begin to
scrub the floor of the travel bureau! Every moment would be disastrous
if they took no precautions against breathing, but happily for us they
have deeply-ingrained sense of gratitude to the human race. They will
never risk thinking in the ordinary, mediocre and <i>sensible</i> way
that people like ourselves do!
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In the next "leaf," however, he inverts this rhetorical procedure of
imputing animate qualities to objects and now gives animate objectivity
to a normally inanimate abstraction. "Suffering," in the sixth "leaf"
becomes a mythic character, like a dragon or sea monster:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Suffering has abundant hair and lives alone on a cliff. The walls of
its house are round and they move up and down like birds' eggs in a
mirage. Bunches of smoke like umbrellas live nearby, with trembling
fingers like glass keys on each of which some date famous in history
has been written. They shake their rattling wrists and Suffering flies
up the chimney and opens its green chemical head like a work-box.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
We might see in Gascoyne's "leaves" a kind of fantastic children's book,
in which the panels have become miraculously animated, like a magic
lantern show. Yet once again this "automatic" character, imparted to
the verbal or pictorial object, would be precisely the opposite of the
readymade automatism of the "reports"&#8212;akin, as Jennings recognized,
to the petrifying and fragmenting snap of the camera shutter. Gascoyne
pushes surrealist lyricism to a magical point of reversal where the limits
of the printed word are overrun and reading takes on a new physicality
and dynamism. He seeks to invest language with a dream-like animation,
so that, as he recounts in "Phenomena," one might say "the words rose
from the places where they had been printed, hovered in the air at a
distance of about six inches from my face and finally, without having
much more than disturbed my impression of their habitual immobility,
dissolved into the growing darkness."

<p>
In concluding my discussion of the British modernist prose poem and its
ties to the documentary aesthetic of the "report," I briefly want to
discuss the animator, illustrator, documentary filmmaker, and poet Len
Lye. Although Lye was not officially a surrealist nor a Mass Observer,
his ties with both groups were substantial. Moreover, he had directly
collaborated with Humphrey Jennings in Grierson's G.P.O. film unit, where
individually both brought an innovative, poetic impulse to the genre of
the documentary: Jennings in films such as <i>Spare Time</i> and <i>A
Diary for Timothy</i>, Lye in <i>Cameramen at War</i> and a number of
short films. In 1936, the two artists, in fact, worked together on an
advertising film for Shell-Mex and British Petroleum, <i>The Birth of the
Robot</i>, with Lye directing and Jennings producing and providing the
color decor. Lye's poetic output, like that of his fellow filmmaker and
painter Jennings, was small but daring. In two successive issues of the
journal <i>Life and Letters Today</i>, in spring and summer of 1938, Lye
published a prose poem sequence entitled "Song-Time Stuff" that offers an
instructive counterpoint to the writings of Jennings, Madge, and Gascoyne.

<p>
Lye's sequence plays off a free-wheeling meditation on visual aesthetics,
thought, and language against two basic discourse forms: the newspaper
article or column and the popular song. The poem is a succession of short
paragraphs, playfully titled in bold face like a headline or song title,
and the texts waver between essay-like statement and avant-garde prose
on the models of Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, and the James
Joyce of <i>Work in Progress</i> (soon to become <i>Finnegans Wake</i>):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
CHAIR IN YOUR HAIR
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Painting painting where is thy mind sting: there there under the chair:
not <i>under</i> the chair says poppa C&eacute;zanne in the legs of
the chair says poppa C&eacute;zanne: that old chair? Chair in you hair
C&eacute;zanne C&eacute;zanne. A chair in the mind is worth none in the
bush. A chair is a chair so leave it there.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The underlying "argument" of this poetic text is a familiar one: Lye's
own particular version of what Ezra Pound called in his imagist writings,
"direct perception of the

<b></b>

thing" or of William Carlos Williams's slogan "No ideas but in
things." Yet what gives Lye's otherwise rather unoriginal aesthetic
meditation its interest is his self-conscious spinning out of these
thoughts on artistic originality within the "readymade" discursive frames
of the newspaper and song.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
Typographically, the sequence strongly resembles those sections of
newspapers in which tidbits of news, society gossip, or letters appear
beneath a caption. In fact, the journal in which Lye's poem appears,
had an editor's "news in brief" section called "News Reel" that also
alluded typographically to this format. Lye, who published regularly in
<i>Life and Letters Today</i> and later became a director in the March
of Time newsreel series, may well have been playing off this journal's
"news" format, which in turn mimics the typical layout of a daily or
weekend paper.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 This allusion to reportage forms, then, suggests that we should see
 "Song-Time Stuff" as a kind of newspaper page or sequence of newsreels
 taking up various topics from the shifting thoughts of the painter as
 he meditates on his art. Here, for example, the "reporter" portrays
 the triviality of outer incident (a sneeze) interrupting the psychic
 eventfulness of dream:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
EFFERVESCENT NIGHT SNEEZE
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
So reality brazens out conclusions for the mind till sleep is the only
eno for thought. The ebb of thought is the flow of self contacting living
reality in one life time. The more impinge the less the flow. ("STS
I," 78)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As with Joyce's playing of newspaper headlines against subjective
stylization in the "Aeolus" episode of <i>Ulysses</i>, however, Lye's
fictive reportage of an argument for the mind's wordless apprehension
of the primordial real generates tensions and ironies.

<p>
At first glance, the irony would seem to be turned, negatively, against
the discourse of journalism. In the section entitled "A HOOK UP FOR THE
HUMAN LINE UP," for example, Lye directly addresses the socially and
culturally levelling effects of the newspaper:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Take newspaper the far-flung human what's-on: a precise analogy with
another index. After the average truth hook up some sort of general line
up. Not until the last line up will average mind inherit mind as its own
best footprint. Take it now take newspaper take man about uniforms about
station italian delegation man about town or philosophers' hilltop or
pub and bets in the park: within some four walls each has his gall. Take
inquisition lore was evermore man about sex about witches or national
sploor. But now the poor are excited to read: horses and new flesh:
reading is good for the poor. Daily doings reflect personal flesh: flesh
fascinates flesh according to glow with entrail revulsion fascination
fascisti bathroom altar sacrificisation body beautiful personal heartthrob
commune problem relation international. When entrails are spilt the news
fascination arrays them right in the readers lap.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Not unlike Joyce, Lye is presenting a kind of excremental flow of events,
predigested and blended into mental waste by the newspaper. He punningly
apposes the fascination of the newspaper reader with sex and violence
to the more literal, scatological and coprophagic connotations of such
phrases as "Daily doings reflect personal flesh,"

<b></b>

"When entrails are spilt," and "the reader's lap." Lye's newspaper is
taken into the toilet, kept on the lap during the "daily doings," and
disposed of properly: "I'll leave it."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
Yet this rather straightforward satire is complicated by the very
quality that the newspaper embodies and that seems to draw Lye's fire,
its ephemerality and the mobility of its reference. For Lye also admits
that he values precisely change and time. It is, then, to the song-form
that Lye turns, with its ability to adjust itself to and artistically
register the flow of time without being constrained to naturalistic
reportage. Song&#8212;here signified by the fragmentation of words and
syntax into rhythmic sound-patterns&#8212;represents for Lye a form
of thought that is concrete, non-conceptual, yet fundamentally attuned
to time and change. In Lye's sequence, song is given the outer form of
the newspaper article but disrupts it from within. Reportage is delayed
through the web of sound associations and puns, deflected from its mimetic
correspondence to the mundane, and detoured out of the documentation of
"daily doings" onto the pathways of mind and thought.

<p>
This deformative forming of referential language through song turns
reportage into the material hum of time, a "song-time-stuff" as a
de-differentiated medium that is not verse poetry nor music nor painting
nor reportage. Only within this new prose-song medium, Lye suggests,
can any genuine report of the mind be given. But it will not resemble the
language of journalism or even of the more subversive reportage of Mass
Observation and its concern with the rituals and customs of that foreign
folk, the British. It will be a new modernist-documentary hybrid, that
"other report" that Jennings, Madge, and Gascoyne in their own idiom and
in their own approach to the prose poem also sought to deliver&#8212;a
report of the mind in its workings, or at least, as the title of one
of Lye's sections indicates, "AN O. K. ECHO" of its complexities and
perplexities ("STS I," 80).

The Charles Madge papers at the Mass Observation Archive, University
of Sussex, contain a suggestive montage of newspaper articles entitled
"In Honour of La Fontaine" (Charles Madge Papers, 19 / 3). A typed note
points out that "the following observations on the human animal are all
taken from the <i>Observer</i> of 5 August, 1934." The eight clippings
pasted to the two sheets include texts on Hitler, the police in Madrid,
a diplomatic warning by Japan to the Soviet Union, British motor travel,
stinging jellyfish, the importation of cats to combat a plague of mice
in Italy, an attack by storks on vultures in Turkey, and the breeding
habits of land crabs. Although this montage corresponds to no published
prose poem text, and I have not been able to locate source material for
the published report-poems, it is plausible to speculate that "In Honour
of La Fontaine" represents a stage of a projected prose poem in which
the newspaper material was meant to be cited or mimicked and recombined
into a surrealistic melange of natural and historical faces of the
"political animal." I am grateful to Dorothy Sheridan and the staff of
the Mass Observation Archive for making these papers available to me.
