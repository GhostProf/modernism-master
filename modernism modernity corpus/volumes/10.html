<p>
I owe much to Ronald Schuchard's earlier work on Eliot, and this
essay makes a new reason for gratitude. It draws many remarkable
connections between Eliot's life and his treatment of Jews in person
and in poetry. Since I disagree with some of Schuchard's conclusions,
let me start by summarizing what I take the essay to establish beyond a
doubt. Eliot looked at the Jews under three almost separate aspects: as a
religion which he respected at a distance; as a scattering of unaffiliated
individuals, part of the urban human debris which he loved and feared
and out of which he made poetry; and as a religion-turned-culture, an
ethical climate of feeling gradually defining itself in secular language,
a tributary of the protestant freethinking which Eliot saw as the essence
of the disintegrative spirit of modernity. Sometimes, in addressing Jews
whom he knew well, Eliot tried to reason with this remnant, to argue them
back into a semblance of their proper religious attachment. This was a
very odd business&#8212;something Schuchard refrains from saying. During
his last years, Eliot was conducting his own conversion of the Jews back
to Judaism. There is a note of muffled humility and sanctimony unique
to him in the pathetic exclamation to Victor Gollancz: "You seem to have
to me enough of Judaism in you to qualify as a Jew in my sight!" 

<p>
Schuchard's account is shaded by a certain tenderness toward Eliot. We are
told that he "arrived in London by mischance in August 1914," though his
chances were rather good, and that he "took refuge" in Merton College,
as if he were one more refugee . A surplus of tenderness may be
necessary if one is to judge kindly the harsh things Eliot said about
the Jews in the

<b></b>

first three decades of his career, from which he retreated in the last two
decades. Perfect anti-Semites are rare, and Eliot was not one of them. He
was friendly or respectful to many Jews, and, during the Second World
War, an active force for assistance to Jewish emigrants. Eliot practiced
better than he preached. Fortunately, the history of prejudice is full
of similar examples. Unfortunately, it is worse in some ways to preach
than to practice intolerance. You do more harm than good in proportion
as your words outrun your actions. But let us distinguish between
kinds of anti-Semitism. There is the anti-Semitism of exclusive clubs
and restrictive covenants; and there is the anti-Semitism of pogroms
and the Holocaust. Belloc, Chesterton, Wharton, Fitzgerald, all had
a stake in anti-Semitism of the first kind, and a story like Saki's
"The Unrest-Cure" depends on the forbidden richness and hilarity of
the very idea of passing from prejudice to persecution. Ezra Pound in
the 1940s became a convert to anti-Semitism of the second kind. Eliot
was closer to Saki, though more obsessed than most of his type, and he
never crossed into persecution. As he turned away from those who did,
he was occasionally startled by reminders of the distinctness of his own
anti-Semitism, which in its context had been neither murderous nor benign.

<p>
Sidney Schiff, John Rodker, Jacob Isaacs, Mark Gertler, Ada
Leverson&#8212;concerning these Jews and others, Schuchard remarks that
Eliot "moved in their company" . I take that uncontroversially as
part of the record. The same holds for his later and less guild-centered
friendships with George Boas, Benjamin Cardozo, Horace M. Kallen, and
Groucho Marx. His championing of Isaac Rosenberg really belongs in a
separate category&#8212;it exhibits in a high degree the generosity of
disinterested judgment. For the rest, it was impossible in the twentieth
century to cherish a deep interest in art without moving in the company
of a large number of free-thinking Jews. Many, after all, were patrons
of the avant-garde, many were champions of particular artists, many were
artists themselves. That Eliot could claim Jews among his friends in no
way disposes of the moral and political charge that he took a mischievous
interest in "the Jews." He did take such a mischievous interest: that
much seems equally uncontroversial, and it is the reasonable reply
to the frivolous shallowness of his disclaimer in a letter to Edward
Field, "I am no more anti-semitic than I am anti-Welsh or anti-Eskimo"
. Nobody would think him anti-Eskimo because he never took that kind
of interest in the Eskimos. For reasons of reticence more than self-doubt,
he avoided giving argumentative shape to his reservations about the
Jews, but pretty plainly the idea was this. Religions, in modernity,
have suffered dissolution into the chaos of an enlightened utilitarian
democratic culture that does not deserve the name of culture. Only in
their integrity as religions do they contribute to civilization. Jews
pose a special danger because they were the first to pass from docile
belief to free thinking, mobility, and skepticism. In this, they are a
pattern for such later unbelievers as Eliot's Unitarian ancestors&#8212;a
connection pointed out by William Empson in his review of the facsimile
<i>Waste Land</i>.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
The Jewish presence in "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar"
makes sense in this setting, and Schuchard's exegesis of that poem reminds
me a little of an analysis I heard William Arrowsmith offer once, at a
Trilling Seminar at Columbia 

<b></b>

University some two decades ago.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 This line of ingenious apologetics I believe Eliot's poetry neither
 solicits nor rewards. An eye protrudes from a face, not from the
 waters of a canal, because that is how the word works in English. As
 for surrealism, it is an excuse that soon wears thin, and, applied to
 Eliot's practice in the quatrain poems, it can only mean that he was
 using people according to imagist doctrine for their hard dry outlines,
 as if they were bits of tessellated stone in a mosaic. Such dehumanizing
 tactics were challenged by a few early readers (Robert Graves, for one)
 not fully imbued with the modernist precept that favors malice as a
 purgative against the "spilt religion" of liberalism.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Anyway, Eliot's practice defies a purely aesthetic defense, owing to
 a difference, overlooked by him and others, between what is possible
 in painting and sculpture and what is possible with words. If Picasso
 or Modigliani shows an African or a Jewish face, as most people have
 experienced such a face, primitive rendering may make the familiar
 image real while drawing effectively on the type. It is not the same
 for the word-artist who tries out the dead word <i>jew</i> hoping
 to make it even deader and more primitive by the underemphasis of
 lowercase lettering. The word will insist on its own life: it has a
 previous moral history that remains active as part of its substantial
 meaning. So the worker in words, because words are universals, is
 indebted to common usage in a way that the inventor or imitator of
 an image is not. Eliot wanted to trade on the advantage of words for
 abstraction, without paying this debt. He was granted his wish in the
 short run. The poem was admired, the jew was permitted. Eventually,
 the history of more than a word overtook him.

<p>
"Gerontion" is characterized by Schuchard as a successful effort of
sympathy with the displaced people of modernity. "Part Hebrew, part
Hellene," Gerontion "sees in the window of his decayed European house a
squatting Jewish landlord, a modern counterpart of Shylock, once again
pushed with his people from nation to nation, from ghetto to ghetto,
'Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London,' fleeing the
horrific pogroms in Poland during the peace process" . An eloquent
description, but of what poem? The words "blistered," "patched," and
"peeled" could conceivably be used by an artist intent on evoking pity,
but if pity and sympathy were your object I doubt that you would select
those words. This Jew's body has been marked and scabbed by a loathsome
disease. The disease will be taken by many readers as a metaphor for a
corruption the man as a type exhibits. Yet by splicing together phrases of
the poem with a montage of the brutal postwar re-organization of Europe,
Schuchard is able to conjure up sympathy for the casualties of the war
and its aftermath, as if Gerontion and the Jew alike were among the
casualties. Where evidence is not in question, one can only register a
contrary intuition. Sympathy with the mass of the stateless cast up by
the war does not seem to me the tenor of "Gerontion."

<p>
We would not be trying to explain any of this if Eliot had not added an
apparent explanation of his own. "Reasons of race and religion combine to
make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable" . He later
professed not to know what he could have meant by the words. But were they
such a lapse, for him? Eliot for a long time found nothing extraordinary
in this utterance. He wrote it, read it aloud to an audience, reread it
when preparing <i>After Strange Gods</i> for press, and approved it

<b></b>

again when he corrected proofs. It is a clipped phrase in his best
manner; and some obvious circumstances explain it. The words were
spoken in 1933, in the American South. In polite company, in America,
anti-Semitism was hardly then the proscribed sentiment it would become
two decades later. Cultural doctrine aside, Eliot was paying a compliment
to his Virginia hosts by sharing one of their prejudices and giving it
a gloss of dignified impartiality. The curious word <i>race</i> comes
into the sentiment partly again because of the Virginia setting. Jews
and Christians, Negroes and white people&#8212;in both cases, the
mixing is undesirable, and the usage of "race" for the first pair
brings in the second tacitly. The remark is a piece of genteel
segregationist fellow-feeling. Later, Eliot would say that race
"ought not" to matter between Christians and Jews. Fine words "ought
not." But barring a millennial world-wide conversion to Christianity,
Eliot favored preservation of the two religions, or races, in their
separate integrity. Nowhere does he come close to saying that the only
race that matters to him is the human race.

<p>
Against this background, his "keen admiration" for the state of Israel,
in a letter of 1963 to Groucho Marx, need not be taken as ironic, but
its meaning is hardly transparent . What kind of place did Eliot
suppose the Israel of David Ben-Gurion to be? It contained, he knew,
plenty of Sephardic Jews, whom he preferred to other kinds of Jews. He
probably did not imagine it as a country full of utopian-socialist
experiments. He could not have thought it "the true heart of Europe"
in the sense Milan Kundera would later intend.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Schuchard offers a fair clue to the function of Israel in the mind of
 Eliot when he quotes from an essay of 1944 on "The Responsibility
 of the Man of Letters and the Cultural Restoration of Europe"
 . Eliot was speaking there about the heritage of Greece and
 Rome. Characteristically, rather than merely omit Israel, he said some
 explicit words about why Israel must be omitted. The train of thought
 in the essay is Arnoldian: a Hebraic emphasis on law and conduct,
 by definition, runs counter to the purposes of culture. There
 is, of course, an ancient alliance between philhellenism and
 anti-Semitism&#8212;to which Lionel Gossman some years ago devoted an
 enthralling essay&#8212;but I do not think Eliot was on its trail in
 1944, if he ever was.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Eliot's strictures of 1944 are important chiefly as a reminder. When
 he talks about the Jews, he always has a particular sense and a
 motive&#8212;even if he will later claim not to "know what my mind
 was." The longer he thinks, the surer he becomes of the necessity of
 excluding Jews, or free-thinking Jews, or Israel in some sense of
 the word, from his idea of Christian culture or civilization. What
 changed over time were the ways in which a sane person with Jewish
 friends could plausibly say or hint at such things.

A Response to Ronald Schuchard

<p>
Ever since Anthony Julius's <i>T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary
Form</i> passionately contended that Eliot "was civil to Jews he knew,
offensive to those who merely knew him through his work," many of Eliot's
admirers have ached to repair the damage.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Ronald Schuchard's scholarly and elegant argument, constructed for this
 purpose, amounts I'm afraid to a one-sided brief for the defence. Why,
 though, when there is obvious evidence to the contrary, strain to make
 Eliot into a "philo-Semite"  and turn him into a less interesting
 re than he was (especially when overstating the case diminishes
 the impact of important new correspondence)? It is not, after all,
 enough to say that some of Eliot's best friends were Jewish. Or that
 they knew about the texts that offended Julius and did not care. Ezra
 Pound, too, had life-long Jewish friends like Louis Zukofsky and he
 too wrote frankly to them about his problems with other Jews.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 But that neither absolves Pound of his more obsessive anti-Semitism nor
 absolves us from acknowledging that Pound's anti-Semitism sometimes
 made his poetry more resonant because it embodied cultural attitudes
 that were far from his alone.

<p>
Recall some texts that Schuchard puts to one side: In 1915 Eliot wrote
his cousin Eleanor Hinkley from Oxford, comparing Oxbridge student types
with Harvard ones. He told her that "two Irishmen" had "rather raised my
opinion of that race" but that the more brilliant and serious Cambridge
students reminded him of "the clever Jew undergraduate mind at Harvard;
wide but disorderly reading, intense but confused thinking, and utter
absence of background and balance and proportion."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Eliot clearly was not free of racial stereotypes, though he was
 sometimes aware of them for what they were. More interestingly he

<b></b>

held them in a way that neither deadened his sympathy for individuals
nor dissolved when his sympathy was engaged. In 1920, he wrote to
Ezra Pound that he had met Maxwell Bodenheim, then fresh from his
steerage-class journey from America. He worried about Bodenheim and his
wife (who was about to give birth), and told Pound that Bodenheim was
"not unintelligent" and that "being Semites I suppose they will survive
somehow" (<i>L</i>, 384). A month later, with a discouraged Bodenheim
about to decamp for lack of work, Eliot asks Pound compassionately
whether he can think of "means by which Bodenheim might be made
self-supporting here" but adds that the problem is that "he is in some
ways more intelligent than the native Britons and excites hostility in
that and other ways" (<i>L</i>, 389).

<p>
The point here is not simply that Eliot shared what Pound later called
the stupid suburban prejudice of anti-Semitism but that his prejudice
was part and parcel of his cultural imagination. As Jonathan Freedman
argues, for James's and Eliot's generations, Jews were key images of
modernity and ambivalently represented both the positive and negative
associations of the modern world (tolerance as well as alienation,
progress as well as materialism).
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 The Eliot who wrote to Maxwell Bodenheim that "I have got used to being
 a foreigner everywhere, and it would fatigue me to be expected to be
 anything else" felt more than a little admiration for modernity's
 "intelligent" escape from cultural limitation, but like James
 instinctively feared the materialism and relativism that lay farther
 down the line (<i>L</i>, 431). If one identified the extreme as Jewish,
 though, one remained safe as long as one could safely distinguish
 oneself as a non-Jew. Which is what many of the great turn of the
 century writers obsessively did&#8212;in their imaginative res
 even more than their critical prose and letters.

<p>
It is disingenuous, therefore, to displace the emphasis from Eliot's
notorious remark that "reasons of race and religion combine to make
any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable" from the word
race and argue, as Schuchard does, that "it is not, regardless of
its appearance, an antisemitic statement; it is an anti-freethinking
statement" . It is disingenuous because (pace his remark to Eleanor
Hinckley about Irishmen) Eliot thought in terms of race, but even
more so because "freethinking" is itself not race neutral. Mocking
"freethinking Christians" carries no sting, just as saying that Jews
"all got natural rhythm" carries no sting&#8212;it goes against the
grain of the stereotype. But change the word after freethinking from
Christian to Jew and freethinking then venomously connotes (in the less
polite formulation of Eliot's letters) an "utter absence of background
and balance and proportion," not to mention a keen instinct for the bottom
line and other things that tend to "excite" the Briton's "hostility." That
Eliot half-admired freethinking ways, in Bodenheim and others, only raised
the stakes and gave the stereotype a heavier unconscious charge. And
that much of his intellectual class shared his ambivalence rendered the
Jewish characters in his poetry relevant and powerful.

<p>
Do the Jews in "Gerontion" and "Burbank" and "Dirge" answer to the letters
I have cited above or to the fascinating remarks Eliot made and Schuchard
unearthed about Europe's refugees after the Great War? We shall have to
consider both, but first we need to read the poems themselves in their
formal complexity, which Schuchard's

<b></b>

brief does not allow him to do. In fact, the poems themselves, I believe,
support some ambiguity. There is reason to conclude, for example,
that Bleistein appears so reprehensible precisely because he is viewed
through the perspective of Burbank, who though gentile is also effete
and imperceptive.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The poem is of two minds about Bleistein and about Burbank, as it is of
 two minds about modernity. And the same might be said about "Gerontion"
 (whose "jew" squatting "on the window sill" in the ambiguities of the
 poem's syntax may metamorphose into "Christ the tiger") and even about
 "Dirge." ("A dead jew's eyes" cannot but invoke Shylock's "hath not
 a Jew eyes," though the reminiscence does more credit to Shakespeare
 than to Eliot.) Yet to leave out, as Schuchard does, some of the most
 offensive elements of the poems (in "Dirge" the "teeth, gold in gold"
 and the repulsive physicality echoed in the Lobster's "scratch scratch
 scratch") hurts rather than helps.

<p>
In his life, Eliot was no more simply a philo-Semite than he was simply
an anti-Semite. He suffered with Jews and genuinely befriended them,
and Schuchard's recovery of his correspondence with Horace Kallen cannot
but remind us of the breadth of his personal sympathy. But Eliot in his
social commentary also supported the establishment of a Church in England
that anchored Jewish second-class status. As Terry Eagleton argued in
1970, writing on "Eliot and a Common Culture," Eliot's social thought
can be affiliated with a rejection of "the liberal theory of society,
of equality of opportunity."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 And as Maud Ellmann has argued more recently, Eliot's idealization of a
 common culture is part and parcel of an irrational fear of social and
 linguistic displacement that resurfaces throughout Eliot's literary
 and cultural criticism.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
In his poetry, Eliot was no less inconsistent, but dramatized his own
ambivalence. It is that drama that in "Burbank," "Gerontion" and even
in "Dirge" can turn on a knife edge (as in a geometrical re whose
symmetries reverse as we stare at it), inviting us to share anti-Semitic
animus and then, discrediting the source of the invitation, making us
ashamed of our response. It is a dangerous game, even more so because
it is rooted in Eliot's unconscious, and it occasionally takes too many
risks. But it is not simple anti-Semitism. On the other hand, to deny
the game by arguing that Eliot was a thoroughgoing philo-Semite fails
to do justice either to Eliot or to his art.

<p>
Modernism defined itself partly in relation to a dual sense of time as
simultaneously diachronic and synchronic. This dual sense of time was
linked to the modernist idea of primitivism in a way that is perhaps best
expressed by T. S. Eliot as an "historical sense" in his essay from 1919,
"Tradition and the Individual Talent," as "a sense of the timeless as
well as of the temporal and of the timeless and the temporal together,"
as Ronald Bush suggests in "The Presence of the Past: Ethnographic
Thinking/Literary Politics."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Characterizing Eliot's positive reviews of Emile Durkheim's <i>The
 Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</i> from 1916 and 1918 as
 representing "a significant moment of intersection between ethnographic
 and literary modernism," Bush argues that, with regard to "Eliot's
 admonition that the poet cultivate a 'historical sense,' a 'perception,
 not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence'": "It is
 impossible to read Eliot's statement, or the poetry it framed, without
 acknowledging how much the ethnographic discourse of primitivism had
 colored both his idea of the past and his notion of the present."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The "ethnographic discourse of primitivism" to which Bush refers was
endemic to European modernism in a broad sense. The "primitive" was
the name given to tribal art as seen in the West and as a wealth of
inspiration for Western modern artists. In the catalogue from the Museum
of Modern Art show from

<b></b>

1984, <i>"Primitivism" in 20th-Century Art</i>, Kirk Varnedoe describes
"primitivism" as "the tendency to admire the virtues of early or
materially less developed societies" which has "a long and diverse
history within Western thought. Even in classical antiquity. Western
literature contains laments for lost simplicity and praise for less
sophisticated societes."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Tribal art was consequently labeled "primitive," even though, as Robert
 Goldwater spelled out in his 1965 preface to <i>Primitivism in Modern
 Art</i>, published in 1938: "It is of course widely accepted today (as
 it was not in 1938) that the art of the so-called primitive peoples is
 not itself 'primitive,' i.e. neither technically crude nor aesthetically
 unsubtle. . . . However much or little primitive art has been a source
 for modern art, the two in fact have almost nothing in common."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 William Rubin elaborated on this explanation in 1984: "That the derived
 term primitivism is ethnocentric is surely there&#8212;and logically so,
 for it refers not to the tribal arts in themselves, but to the Western
 interest in and reaction to them. Primitivism is thus an aspect of
 the history of modern art, not of tribal art."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
The luxurious journal <i>Minotaure</i>, published by Albert Skira
and E. T&eacute;riade in France from 1933 to 1939, was exemplary of
ethnographic modernism in its focus on ethnography, in particular in
the first three issues from 1933. The journal also became a vehicle for
Bretonian surrealism, which had begun to focus increasingly on objects.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 The inaugural issues from 1933 presented tribal practices and art
 brought back from the ethnographic Dakar-Djibouti Misson alongside
 work by such contemporary artists as Pablo Picasso, Andr&eacute;
 Masson, Man Ray, and Brassa&iuml;. In the double number 3-4 from
 December 1933, <i>Minotaure</i> published a series of six photographs
 of "involuntary sculptures" by Brassa&iuml;, born Gyula Halasz in
 Brasso Transylvania (1899-1984), which serve as a sort of "preface"
 to an article on Art Nouveau by Salvador Dal&iacute;, who most likely
 also wrote the captions for Brassa&iuml;'s images (<a name="1"
 href="10.1conley_res.html#1"> 1</a>). In their simultaneous
 evocation of scientific-historical and aesthetic-ahistorical time,
 these photographs exemplify the ethnographic thinking Bush ascribes
 to Eliot in 1919.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
This double issue from December, 1933, expressed a subtle change in
editorial mission that had been implicit from the start, namely the
explicit inclusion of science in the journal's vision of the spirit of
the modern movement.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Following in the footsteps of the alternative surrealist journal edited
 by Georges Bataille, <i>Documents</i>, which ran from 1929 through 1930,
 issue number 3-4 of <i>Minotaure</i> stated that: "It is impossible
 today to isolate the plastic arts from poetry and science. The most
 characteristic modern movements have closely linked these three areas."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 The most obvious reference here is to surrealism, for which Sigmund
 Freud's theory of the unconscious served as much as a point of
 departure as Pierre Reverdy's definition of the poetic image, and which
 became explicitly linked to art with the publication of the first
 installment of Breton's essay "Surrealism and Painting" in the July
 1925 of <i>La R&eacute;volution surr&eacute;aliste</i>. In addition
 to Brassa&iuml;'s so-called "sculptures," this number features five
 articles on psychology, including a psychoanalytic study by Jacques
 Lacan, three articles on automatism, two articles each on photography
 and divination, and one each on painting, sculpture, architecture,
 and music, together with a survey on objective chance. Critics have
 been correct in claiming that "the quest of <i>Minotaure</i> . . . was
 nothing less than a new definition of humanity."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<b>[Begin Page 130]</b>

<p>
Explaining his highly pertinent term "ethnographic surrealism," a variant
on the concept of ethnographic modernism, and one which very accurately
describes the orientation of <i>Minotaure</i> in 1933, James Clifford
states that "[e]thnography cut with surrealism emerges as the theory
and practice of juxtaposition."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 He elaborates the extent to which this combination made sense in the
 1930s in France in particular (as opposed to England or the United
 States):
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I am referring to a more general cultural predisposition that cuts through
modern anthropology and that this science shares with twentieth-century
art and writing. The ethnographic label suggests a characteristic attitude
of participant observation among the artifacts of a defamiliarized
cultural reality. The surrealists were intensely interested in exotic
worlds, among which they included a certain Paris. Their attitude,
while comparable to that of the fieldworker who strives to render the
unfamiliar comprehensible, tended to work in the reverse sense, making
the familiar strange. (
<i>POC</i>, 121)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
That "certain Paris" seen by the surrealists as "exotic" was nowhere
better represented than in the nocturnal photographs of Brassa&iuml;,
who settled in Paris in the 1920s and whose work illuminated, as though
from within, his adopted "city of lights's" nightlife.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<i>Minotaure</i> published roughly one hundred and fifty photographs by
Brassa&iuml;, who claimed that "the surrealism of my pictures was only
reality made more eerie by my way of seeing. I never sought to express
anything but reality itself, than which there is nothing more surreal."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 His <i>Minotaure</i> photographs blur the distinction between
 ethnography as science and as aesthetic by examining familiar European
 objects with the same scientific detail as unfamiliar tribal objects
 and by making them visible in their newfound strangeness&#8212;as
 decontextualized as a mask hanging in a Paris art museum.

<p>
Surrealists responded so strongly to tribal art because they
saw themselves as pursuing primitivist goals, according the French
definition of <i>primitif</i>: "Adj. 1. Which is at its origin, or close
to it. 2. Which is the first, the oldest. 3. Which is the source, the
origin (of something with the same nature)."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 As Varnedoe summarizes: "It thus may refer both to foreign peoples
 and to that which is most deeply innate within oneself."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Goldwater finds three "aspects of the surrealists' view of their method
 and art" that "may be called primitivist" (<i>PIMA</i>, 217). The
 first one coincides with the third definition of <i>primitif</i>,
 "Which is at its origin, or close to it": "In the first place they
 looked upon themselves as continuing a tradition of anti-rational
 exteriorizing of the subconscious that went back to the alchemists"
 (<i>PIMA</i>, 217). The second coincides with the second dictionary
 definition, "Which is the first, the oldest": "In the second place
 the surrealists, although recognizing some valuable ancestors, saw
 themselves as beginners, as pioneer explorers in the realm of the
 subconscious" (<i>PIMA</i>, 217). The third may be associated with
 the first definition, "Which is the source, the origin (of something
 with the same nature)": "And lastly . . . the surrealists considered
 that they were working with the essentials of human nature as finally
 revealed by psychology" (<i>PIMA</i>, 217).

<p>
These surrealist properties linked to "primitivism" by
Goldwater&#8212;irrationality, pioneer exploration of the unconscious,
and the study of human nature through psychology&#8212;are

<b></b>

all evident in number 3-4 of <i>Minotaure</i>.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 This number also features an article by Brassa&iuml; on graffiti
 art, "Du Mur du caverne au mur d'usine," illustrated with his own
 photographs, in which he claims that the primitive in the form of "the
 stone age" is "a state of mind" that is as visible on Parisian walls in
 1933 as it was on cave walls thousands of years ago. He sees graffiti
 as emerging from the very source of the human drive to make signs:
 "These succinct signs are nothing less than the origin of writing,
 those animals, those monsters, those demons, those heroes, those
 phallic gods&#8212;nothing less than the elements of mythology."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Mention of the concept of "the primitive" also surfaces in Breton's
 reiteration of the importance of automatism to surrealism in "Le
 Message automatique," where he characterizes automatic writing as a
 "verbal flow" with a desirably "primitive direction" ("LMA," 58). It
 appears a third time in Jean Frois-Wittman's article on modern art and
 the pleasure principle. The entire issue also explores the mysterious
 intersections between chance and destiny that so fascinated the
 surrealists, exemplified by the reproduction of Rimbaud's horoscope,
 and it does so with disregard for the probable tastes of those who
 could afford what Brassa&iuml; himself called a "sumptuous review
 . . . beyond the reach of proletarian pocketbooks."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Outside of <i>Minotaure</i>, whose eclectic pages showed no hesitation in
mixing "high" (sculptures by Picasso) and "low" (cheap postcards) art,
found objects and tribal art could be easily confused by 1933 because
the generic confusion between art and ethnography had become irrevocably
established by then.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 By 1936, the exhibition of surrealist objects in Charles Ratton's art
 gallery was interspersed with tribal ones.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 In the first issue of <i>Documents</i>, Georges-Henri Rivi&egrave;re
 described plans for the renovation of the Trocad&eacute;ro museum
 almost as an "anti-Museum of Fine Arts," a place where objects would
 explicitly <i>not</i> be classified according to their aesthetic appeal.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 But three years later, under the influence of Ratton, the
 Trocad&eacute;ro became the venue for the "Exposition de Bronzes
 d'Ivoires du Royaume du B&eacute;nin," organized by Ratton himself, who
 set up the exhibit to show off the beauty of the pieces displayed. As
 Jean-Louis Paudrat explains, "despite the 'counter-aesthetic'
 orientation a few years earlier of those who had reorganized the
 Trocad&eacute;ro Museum, 'certain rare and beautiful pieces' were
 transformed from indexes of another way of life into masterpieces of
 world art."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
From the start, this divided attention paid to tribal objects&#8212;viewed
as keys to a deeper scientific understanding of foreign cultures whose
goal in creating them had not been aesthetic, but also as models of
artistic skill, achievement, and beauty&#8212;diversified the ways in
which they were perceived. Certain critics and collectors, like Goldwater,
Max Ernst, and Tristan Tzara, retained an awareness of the historical
context in which these objects were made.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Others, like Breton, and, according to William Rubin, Picasso,
 cared far more for their symbolic, conceptual and formal values,
 appreciable with no historical knowledge. That view, it is true,
 entailed misunderstandings of their original function, called "creative
 misreadings" by Rubin, which, in the case of Picasso, resulted in turn
 in some of the masterpieces of Western art.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 This double perception of tribal objects as existing within historical
 time and outside of it, as temporal and timeless, added to their
 mystery&#8212;a mystery which spilled over onto

<b></b>

the surrealist objects that co-existed with tribal art in the studios of
most of the surrealists. Through a similar process of decontextualization,
surrealist objects likewise became timeless aesthetic objects nevertheless
haunted by an unknown historical past.

<p>
The most important quality shared by tribal art and surrealist objects
was a perceived sacred presence within the object capable of marshalling
"latent forces" and communicating with the viewer. Brassa&iuml;'s
"sculptures" were initially labeled "large-scale" or "automatic objects,"
which he photographed "in collaboration" with Dal&iacute;. He argued
in a newspaper article from 1950 that photography was the art of giving
"things the chance to express themselves."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Certainly the surrealists sought what Walter Benjamin called "<i>profane
 illumination</i>, a materialistic, anthropological inspiration" in
 their everyday world and in the material objects populating that world.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 For despite their iconoclastic attitude towards such sacred icons
 of bourgeois taste as the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, the surrealists sought,
 in those "lowly" objects they discovered in flea markets alongside
 the inexpensive African masks they collected, a similar kind of aura
 to that of the "high" art hanging in the Louvre.

<p>
Already in 1931, in his essay "Objets surr&eacute;alistes" in <i>Le
Surr&eacute;alisme au service de la r&eacute;volution</i>, Dal&iacute;
had claimed that the surrealist object was invested with erotic
power. Andr&eacute; Breton attributes the same power to the found
object in "La Beaut&eacute; sera convulsive," in the May 1934 issue
of <i>Minotaure</i> (the issue following the one with Brassa&iuml;'s
"involuntary sculptures"). Breton compares being in Paris to being in a
<i>for&ecirc;t d'indices</i> to which the surrealist responds eagerly,
eyes wide open.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Within this "forest" of signs Breton includes the sort of found object
 he had already described in <i>Nadja</i> years earlier, and which
 alone reveals :



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the marvelous precipitate of desire. It alone can enlarge the universe,
causing it to relinquish some of its opacity, letting us discover
its extraordinary capacities for reserve. . . . Daily life abounds,
moreover, in just this sort of small discovery, where there is frequently
an element of apparent gratuitousness. . . . I am profoundly persuaded
that any perception registered in the most involuntary way . . . bears
in itself the solution, symbolic or other, of a problem you have with
yourself. . . . You have only to know how to get along in the labyrinth.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Like the mythological Minotaur trapped in the labyrinth, human
beings must try to decipher the world that surrounds them as a way of
understanding themselves and their own natures divided between conscious
and unconscious minds, just as the Minotaur's nature was divided between
human and animal. Unlike the Minotaur, the surrealist hopes to survive
the experience of the labyrinth and to emerge from it whole.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
Surrealist objects aid this process of exploration and survival by helping
to clarify our own desires and drives: they reflect back aspects of the
self to the person who finds them, as Breton suggests. They operate in two
ways: making the familiar strange, as Clifford claims, and also making
the strangeness in ourselves comprehensible. In this way they manifest
characteristics of the Freudian uncanny, the deeply disquieting nature
of finding the strange in the familiar, of discovering that a woman is
only a doll, for example, that an animate being is in fact inanimate
(or the opposite). Freud's essay,

<b></b>

translated into French only in 1933, the same year that <i>Minotaure</i>
was launched, bolstered the surrealists in their on-going investigations
of the psychic properties of objects.

<p>
In their quasi-animate status, surrealist objects resemble the tribal
masks brought back by ethnographers from Africa and Oceania and placed
in museums. These were initially studied not aesthetically&#8212;as what
became known in Europe as "primitive" works&#8212;but scientifically,
as elements of religious worship whose value lay in the transformation
they underwent during rituals when, momentarily, they seemed to become
inhabited by the potent spirit forces called upon by the tribal group. At
the height of the religious ceremony, therefore, these objects became
double, embodying and representing a force other than themselves in
a manner parallel to the way the surrealist experienced the dawning
awareness, through automatism (often practiced in a group), of the
functioning of the unconscious mind, as though it were a separate and
mysterious part of the self.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Ethnography, the social science that studied tribal art in
context, thus shared in common with surrealism a turning away
from Cartesianism. Mich&egrave;le Richman argues that "although
methodologicially closer to the social sciences," ethnography "drew
insights from other cultures into modes of thought resistant to the
definition of logic sanctioned by the West."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<i>Minotaure</i> presented the point of view of what Clifford calls the
"participant observer." The artists in these pages look at their own
cultures as closely as they examine those of others and thus define
themselves as receptors as much as creators of art and culture. They
provide the "scientific description of individual cultures" from the
dictionary definition of <i>ethnograpy</i>; it is left to the reader
to process these juxtaposed descriptions and images according to the
interest in <i>ethnology</i> pronounced by the journal's masthead, which
purports to "analyze cultures," both foreign and familiar, rather than
merely to describe them. Thanks to the journal's equalizing strategy of
juxtaposition, within its pages, Brassa&iuml;'s "involuntary sculptures"
received equal billing with art by mediums and the mentally ill, as
well as African masks and with sculptures by such artists as Picasso
and Giacometti photographed in their studios.

<p>
Ideologically, ethnography also strove to contextualize and equalize. As
Michel Leiris passionately affirmed in an article in <i>Documents</i>
from 1930 announcing the Dakar-Djibouti mission, in which he participated
and upon which he later reported in <i>Minotaure</i>, ethnography is the
"most generally human science, because not limited&#8212;like most of the
others&#8212;to white men . . . it extends to the totality of humankind."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Similarly, in his article on graffiti art, in number 3-4 of
 <i>Minotaure</i>, Brassa&iuml; claimed that what could be called
 ethnographic thinking had made all people equal, throughout historical
 time ("DMDC," 6). Breton applies the same principle to the equalizing
 force of surrealist automatism in the same number: "The main
 quality of surrealism is to have proclaimed the total equality of
 all normal human beings in front of the subliminal message" ("LMA,"
 62). <i>Minotaure</i> certainly equalized photography with sculpture
 and painting, by elevating it far above the role of mere illustration
 and inviting photographers like Brassa&iuml; and Man Ray to contribute
 articles about it to the journal.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Within the larger context of <i>Minotaure</i>, what is the reader to
make of Brassa&iuml;'s so-called "involuntary sculptures"&#8212;which
are sculptures, not objects, as Dawn Ades reminds us, because made by
human hands, their "authors" identified by a triple "X" in the issue's
table of contents?
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The first two are more or less recognizable for what they are, rolled
 bus tickets. The first one invites a flash of recognition for all those
 private moments when we have nervously toyed with a piece of paper
 in our pockets. The second could at first glance be confused with
 an animate creature like an insect. Its mystery derives partly from
 the fact that it is blown up and consequently distorted to our eyes in
 relation to its "natural" appearance, precisely as though the photograph
 were intended for scientific observation. The framing underscores the
 fact that the viewer doubles the photographer's position, which is
 that of an ethnographic "observer."

<p>
These photographs have the psychological effect of reminding the viewer
of some of her or his most thoughtlessly private moments and invite
us to wonder if something meaningful might not be attached to such
haphazard fiddling, in the way that Freud discovered that meaning might
be extracted from the recital of a person's dreams, the leftovers of
everyday activities. Could, in fact, truths about the self and about
humanity itself lurk in such "automatic" creations? Who would save
such things, let alone preserve them by photographing them? Are not
these images linked, in part, by their disposability? Are they perhaps,
like the broken pots so closely examined in archeological excavations,
the everyday trash that reveals and identifies us as a people&#8212;the
detritus that marks an era: in the detailed scroll design on the first
bus ticket, for example, which would no longer be made with such care? And
do they have aesthetic value?

<p>
I will begin to answer the question of the aesthetic value of these
photographs with my own subjective response to them. The fifth photograph
struck me as strangely beautiful when I first looked at it on its own
at the Brassa&iuml; retrospective in Paris in the summer of 2000.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 At first glance I thought it was an enlarged photograph of an exotic
 flower, of the sort immortalized by Karl Blossfelt in <i>Documents</i>.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 I admired what I took to be its glossy petals and wondered whether it
 might not be one of those floral carnivorous oddities: an insect-eating
 plant. Only after checking the label did I learn what the photograph
 was of&#8212;an accidental blob of toothpaste. The label repeated the
 <i>Minotaure</i> caption by Dal&iacute;: "the morphological chance
 quality of smudged toothpaste does not escape delicate and ornamental
 stereotyping."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
This revelation, which made me laugh, prompted me to go backwards
and forwards in the exhibition to the others of these "sculptures"
and to look at them more carefully, with their label identification in
mind. Thus what Dal&iacute; calls an "elementary" rolling stopped being
a mysterious cigarette, the ornamental bread was no longer a stone
goddess, the soap bubble ceased to resemble blown glass, just as the
toothpaste dab had become un-transformed and had lost its identity as
an exotic blossom. And yet my new view of these unmasked images remained
haunted by my first impression. They remained, for me, almost like those
psychological double or "reversible images," like the two faces and the
urn or the young beauty and the old woman, which can be described as
"anamorphic" because they represent two images in one which cannot be

<b></b>

apprehended fully in a single glance. In the case of Brassa&iuml;'s
"involuntary sculptures" it had to do with the scale of the photographs
and with the manner of their distortion.

<p>
Shot in such tight close-up and enlarged, with an almost irrationally
lavish attention, these objects are literally transformed by their framing
into more than the ephemera that they are&#8212;bread to be eaten; rolled
bits of paper to be thrown out with the garbage&#8212;having outlived
their usefulness as signs of minor economic transactions. What is more,
rarely would a person, particularly an adult, see these objects in such
an intimate way. And that intimacy, that spectral sense, is part of what
makes these "sculptures" surrealist, because, like surrealist "found"
objects, they seem almost animate and organic.

<p>
I believe that that is what I was seeing when I mistook the blob
of toothpaste for a carnivorous flower&#8212;I was seeing a "being"
where there ought to have been none. When Brassa&iuml; wrote in 1950
that photography was the art of giving "things the chance to express
themselves" he was arguing that objects contained communicable messages
which he attempted to reveal, even if he was also perpetrating a visual
joke in the spirit of Salvador Dal&iacute;, whose essay on Art Nouveau
architecture, designated by the name "Modern'Style" in an abbreviated
form of the French for Art Nouveau ("Modern Style"), these photographs
precede and, to a limited extent, illustrate. For despite the fact
that a reading of the pseudo-scientific/art-critical captions probably
composed by Dal&iacute; for Brassa&iuml;'s photographs elicits laughter,
there remains the uncanny sense that by making us look twice at these
disposable bits of ordinary urban life, Brassa&iuml; succeeds in making
them come alive.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 They seem eerily to communicate "involuntarily," and, as it were,
 thus to produce a visual version of automatic writing. Rosalind Krauss
 argues this when she proposes that the surrealist photographer's frame
 "announces the camera's ability to find and isolate what we could
 call the world's constant production of erotic symbols, its ceaseless
 automatic writing."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Furthermore, with the echo they conjure between contemporary everyday
objects and archeological discoveries from the historical past, these
"sculptures" combine the sense of historical and ahistorical time typical
of ethnographic modernist thinking.

<p>
In their three-dimensionality, Brassa&iuml;'s "sculptures" resemble
the wild flights of fancy embodied in the Art Nouveau architecture so
admired by Dal&iacute;, partly because in this style, too, Dal&iacute; saw
automatism at work. In "De la beaut&eacute; terrifiante et comestible de
l'architecture Modern'Style," beginning on the page facing Brassa&iuml;'s
"sculptures," Dal&iacute; claims that, like the surrealist object,
Art Nouveau architecture awakens a sense of desire in the viewer who
responds to both its latent psychic and evident physical qualities. It
is the product of the transformation of past styles, through a "formal,
convulsive" "birth," into a new style that is so utterly "impure" it
paradoxically attains the highest degree of "immaculate" purity, with
its dream-inspired curves. For him, the manner in which it provokes
desire is directly, and humorously, linked to hunger: Art Nouveau
architecture makes buildings look like cakes, which, far from being
problematic, for Dal&iacute;, enhances their appeal and accentuates
their "hyper-materialization" of the instinctual urges in which all
supposedly "ideal" desires are rooted. Art Nouveau architecture embodies
"continuous erotic ecstasy," and consequently is utterly anti-rational,
even "hysterical."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
The wild, "convulsive" psychological effects of Art Nouveau architecture,
which, Dal&iacute; acknowledges, is held to be the epitome of bad
taste by most of his contemporaries, adds weight to my contention that
Brassa&iuml;'s preceding "sculptures," (three of which are explicitly
described as showing "Modern'Style" characteristics), were understood
by Dal&iacute; and Brassa&iuml; as strangely animate. Unlike surrealist
objects, however, Brassa&iuml;'s mysterious "sculptures" have no "life"
beyond the photograph. Reduced to their actual size, they would lose their
power; they would probably no longer seem haunted and would return to
being trash. Similarly, several of the tribal artifacts featured in the
second issue of <i>Minotaure</i>, devoted entirely to the Dakar-Djibouti
mission, would have lost their magical potency once the ceremony for
which they had been created was over, according to anthropologists. For,
as art historian Thomas McEvilley insists:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In their native contexts these objects were invested with feelings of awe
and dread, not of esthetic ennoblement. They were seen usually in motion,
at night, in closed dark spaces, by flickering torchlight. . . . [M]any
primitive groups when they have used an object ritually (sometimes only
once), desacralize it and discard it as garbage.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus these ephemeral "sculptures" exemplify most precisely the
junction of ethnographic and aesthetic perspective representative of
<i>Minotaure</i> and the surrealist group in 1933 ("TEOA," 134). They
show how deeply Brassa&iuml; had internalized the conceptual functioning
of tribal art and reflect the extent to which he understood the tricky
union and division bonding and separating an ethnographic sensibility
to and from a surrealist one. These works are beautiful, but only in
the instant of distortion permitted by the photographic moment, which
stands in mechanically for the ritual ceremony that transforms tribal
art into awe-inspiring icons. The ritualizing event is equivalent to
the photographic process. After the images were taken, the toothpaste
and soap would have been cleaned up and washed away, like the tribal
masks thrown out after the ceremony for which they were created. These
photographs endow the real with the surreal.

<p>
Brassa&iuml;'s photographs focus the ethnographic gaze on the Parisian
"participant observer" and invite Western viewers to reconsider their
own culture in light of discoveries made about others. These works are
typical of modernist and surrealist ethnographic thinking because of the
ways in which they conflate what is timeless because ancient with what
is temporal because contemporary, a stone goddess with an ornamental
bread roll. They make us aware that sometimes what we hold sacred are
exactly those things we tend to take most for granted, that an ornamental
bread roll <i>can</i> be beautiful and, albeit fleetingly, as precious
as a newly discovered piece of ancient art. At a UNESCO banquet in 1963,
Brassa&iuml; remarked that "the <i>surreal</i> exists within us . . . in
the things which have become so banal that we no longer notice them,
and in the <i>normality of the normal</i>."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
Beginning with the tarot cards on the cover, number 3-4 of
<i>Minotaure</i> invites the reader to see latent forces at work
everywhere we look. As Brassa&iuml; writes in the opening sentences to
his essay on graffiti: "Everything is a question of optical focus. Living
analogies establish vertiginous rapprochements across the ages by the
simple elimination

<b></b>

of the factor of time" ("DMDC," 6). What is caught in time can be seen
anew by a release from temporality into timelessness. It all depends on
how you look, which, in conclusion, sums up the entire thrust of this
issue and of its ethnographic thinking: juxtapositions, like accidental
meetings or coincidences, can make the receptive participant observer
"see, really see," as Andr&eacute; Breton had claimed about chance seven
years earlier, in <i>Nadja</i>.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 And seeing anew the mundane, mixing the timeless and the temporal,
 defamiliarizing the familiar in order to recover its lost originary
 magic, was, in many ways, what surrealism was all about. Furthermore,
 Brassa&iuml;'s non-verbal focus on seeing brings surrealism back
 to modernist ethnographic thinking, at least the way Frank Kermode
 describes it in "Modernism, Postmodernism, and Explanation" in which
 he emphasizes modernism's focus on looking.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Kermode characterizes one of Freud's accomplishments, and Wittgenstein's
ambitions, as compelling the reader "to undertake a change of aspect,"
to come to a new level of understanding of the familiar ("MPAE,"
361). This "change of aspect" resembles Eliot's dual reading of time
as both timeless and temporal because of the way it refers to the
modernist way of seeing influenced by ethnographic thinking which
impells the viewer to see something once, and then again under a
different "aspect," and thus to understand that not everything can be
logically "explained." What Kermode concludes about literary modernism
as influenced by ethnographic thinking could also be proposed about
Brassa&iuml;'s photography in <i>Minotaure</i>: "Thus there grew up a new
veneration for art that leaves out, and so has a chance of containing,
the unutterable. . . . Hence there is a sense that to represent the
truth . . . is to write what must be looked at, rather than explained"
("MPAE," 366). Brassa&iuml; made his viewer look at the obvious in new
ways, rendering visible that which had become invisible in everyday life.

Bourgeois distinctions between high and low culture were abolished by

format of <i>Minotaure</i>, rich in color plates, the surrealist journal

art in his <i>"Primitivism" in 20th-Century Art"</i> exhibition
at the Museum of Modern Art in 1984 and in his catalogue. However,
despite the problematic fact that the tribal pieces are not dated in the
catalogue, Rubin and other contributors do make the distinction between
"tribal" art and how it was used by Western artists who considered it
"primitivist." Rubin explains that "the tribal sculptor creating ritual
objects for a cult had no consciousness whatever of aesthetic solutions"
(see Rubin, <i>"Primitivism" in 20th-Century Art</i>, 28) while arguing
for what he calls "affinities" between the goals of Western and tribal
artists: to attempt to make visible an ivisible inferior force.

In <i>Picasso and Company</i>, Brassa&iuml; described the surrealist
attraction to the Minotaur as to "the force which shatters the limits of
the rational, flooding across its frontiers, tearing down the laws and
offending the gods. They identified him with their own aspirations:
constant and universal violence, absolute revolt, total defiance,

The surrealists collected them in part because of their representations
of the (at least) double nature of human beings, as Elza Adamowicz
argues: "Putting into play surrealism's double aim, of integration
and disintegration, of totalization and fragmentation, the mask, that
equivocal space and re of alterity, is the place of the appearance
of the other within the same, of the apparition of the surreal in
the heart of the real" (see Adamowicz, "Un Masque peut en masquer (ou

that "one of the magazine's truly revolutionary contributions was the
use of photography," not only within surrealism but in the art world as
well: "from then on, it is an 'art' with as much legitimacy as sculpture

<p>
One of the big questions Adorno's work raises concerns the normative
and evaluative ground of his ethical writings and of his social theory.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 In the major works of his mature philosophy&#8212; <i>Negative
 Dialectics</i> and <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>&#8212;Adorno criticizes the
 elements of social life that threaten the autonomy of the individual
 and that encourage individuals to adopt instrumental relations to
 other people and things.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Adorno's criticisms are unambiguously normative. In <i>Negative
 Dialectics</i><i>,</i> he describes his theory as "the ontology of the
 false state of things" and adds that "a right state of things would
 be free from dialectics: just as little a system as a contradiction."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 The rather puzzling counterposition of the attributes "false" and
 "right" betrays his underlying normative concern. Adorno has an emphatic
 conception of truth/falsity that is both Platonic and Hegelian. Insofar
 as he conceives truth as an aspect of the good, or rather the converse,
 untruth as an aspect of the bad, Adorno is a follower of Plato. Insofar
 as his conception of untruth "aims at bad actuality,"i.e., insofar as
 he maintains that untruth or falsity is embodied in the social world,
 Adorno follows Hegel.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 When Adorno claims that philosophy responds to a "world that is false
 to its innermost reaches," he means that it responds to a corrupt or bad
 world, to a world that ought not to be as it is (<i>ND</i>, 41 [31]).

<p>
That said, <i>Negative Dialectics</i>is not a work of normative ethical
theory, and Adorno's ethical concerns are atypical. He makes no attempt
to answer the central questions of normative ethics such as "What is
goodness?" "How should one live?" "What ought I to do?" etc. Even when
writing about Kant's practical philosophy,

<b></b>

Adorno, as befits someone who believed that "there is no right way to
live in a false world," shows little or no interest in normative ethical
theory (<i>MM</i>, 39; <i>PDM</i>, 9 [1]).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<i>Negative Dialectics</i>, for example,is concerned rather
with the relation between concepts and objects. It is an immanent
criticism of Kantian epistemology and a qualified rehabilitation of
metaphysics. Ethical concerns arise because, according to Adorno,
universal concepts "violate," "mutilate," "dominate," and even
"liquidate" the particulars they subsume, and because thinking stands
accused of being in league with institutional and social structures of
domination. But it is not clear what normative implications, if any,
this thesis in neo-Kantian epistemology really has. While the normative
force of Adorno's work is open to view, its normative and evaluative
grounds remain obscure.

<p>
One of my aims in this essay is to suggest an answer to the question of
what the normative/evaluative grounds of Adorno's social philosophy are.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 I suggest that an answer is to be found in his metaphysics. An ancillary
 aim, not so obvious from my title, is to situate Adorno's metaphysics
 with respect to Hegel's. This is a necessary, if rather daunting
 preliminary, because Adorno's metaphysics are a kind of knowing
 dialectical inversion of Hegel's. Like Hegel, Adorno scrupulously
 refrains from normative ethical theory, and endorses Hegel's well-known
 criticisms of Kant's moral philosophy. Adorno is faithful to Hegel's
 famous dictum that the task of philosophy is not to "issue instructions
 as to how the world ought to be."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Adorno and Hegel both agree that philosophy aims at truth and that,
 as Hegel puts it in the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, "what only
 ought to be, without in fact being, has no truth."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 To put it another way, Adorno has no truck with moralising and external
 criticism and expressly forbears from making such criticisms himself.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
This makes Adorno's position even less straightforward. For Hegel's
rejection of Kantian moralising criticism is grounded in, and depends
upon, his own ontotheological understanding of the task of philosophy,
namely to recognize the rational in the actual. But Adorno emphatically
rejects exactly this aspect of Hegel's ontotheology. Whilst Adorno agrees
that it is <i>not</i> the task of philosophy to tell the world how it
ought to be, unlike Hegel he makes very strong normative criticisms of
existing reality. This causes tension between Adorno's philosophical
allegiance to Hegel and his concomitant rejection of moralising criticism
on the one hand and his emphatic criticism of society on the other. How
can Adorno avoid presupposing normative criteria that are "external"
and "moralising," and thus remain a consistent pupil of Hegel, whilst
advancing a social philosophy that is both normative and critical?


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
1 Hegel's Metaphysical Project
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
I shall begin to answer this question by contrasting Hegel's social
philosophy with Adorno's. As already mentioned, in the Preface to the
<i>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</i> Hegel famously warns philosophy
not to set up a world beyond the present. He claims by contrast that
philosophy's task proper lies in comprehending "the present and the
actual," and in "showing how the state, as the ethical universe, should be

<b></b>

recognized." Philosophy's job is not to formulate laws for itself, but
to observe actual laws, to find their "inner-pulse," their rational core
(<i>EPR</i>, 21).
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 This line of thought needs to be understood in the context of Hegel's
 distinction between actuality and existence. "Actuality" (Wirklichkeit),
 which is sometimes translated misleadingly as "reality," is a technical
 term for Hegel, which applies to a much narrower domain than that
 of existence.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Hegel refers to the latter as "lazy (tr&auml;ge) existence" or
 "mere being."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 To understand what is lazy about existence we need to ask what
 makes actuality superior to it. In the domain of objective spirit,
 i.e. among all the institutions, practices, customs and beliefs that
 count as objectifications of the spirit, some, but not all, exist for
 good reasons. The difference is that actuality continues to exist for
 good reason, whilst lazy existence simply continues to exist.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Where an institution exists for good reasons, these reasons as it were
 nourish its existence. Moreover, the good reasons that support the
 actuality of one institution tend to accrete other such institutions:
 actuality spreads out along the axis of its underlying rationale.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 By contrast, where an institution exists for no good reason, there is
 no internal pressure for it to persist. Indeed, when all goes well,
 lazy existence tends to wither and lapse into non-existence. It is,
 though, only under favorable historical and social conditions that lazy
 existence dies out. Given unfavorable historical and social conditions,
 lazy existence stays put. Hegel certainly believed that in the time
 of "ferment" in which he lived, historical and social conditions in
 Germany were favorable for the development of actuality; but he also
 held that this process still had a rather long way to go.

<p>
There are two independently necessary and jointly sufficient conditions
of Hegelian actuality.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 An institution is actual in Hegel's sense if and only if

<p>
a. its existence satisfies the right of "the subject's
<i>particularity</i>," (<i>EPR</i>, 151) i.e. the institution satisfies
or does not thwart the basic interests of each subject, where a subject
is someone who participates in the institutions and practices that make
up the cultural life of a community; and

<p>
b. each subject can accept the institution because it satisfies his or
her basic interests.

<p>
In other words, if an institution or practice <i>does</i> satisfy the
interests of each participating subject, and if it can be accepted by
each subject because it satisfies their interests, then that institution
is actual; and conversely if an institution or practice is actual, it
manifestly satisfies the interests of all participating subjects. In
short, actuality is what is good and what can be known to be good.

<p>
A couple of qualifications are needed. Firstly, this account assumes that
what is good, is necessarily <i>good for</i> a person or persons. This
becomes important when one looks at the second condition, that actuality
can be known to be good. The second condition is that actuality can
be known to be good (for them) by those people for whom it is good,
not by some better knowing leader or elite, and not by some disembodied
impersonal spirit. Secondly, it is very important that there are two
separate conditions, which are only jointly sufficient for actuality. For
Hegel likens his philosophy to a "true theodicy" (<i>W</i>, 20: 455).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 This description is only meaningful if a false theodicy is
 possible. Hegel does not actually talk about false theodicy but he
 implies that one is possible. By implication, a false theodicy would
 be one that convinces us

<b></b>

that the world is good when it is not. A false theodicy would project
the illusion of actuality onto mere existence. It would convince subjects
that what merely exists, which is a bad state of affairs, is really good
(for them). To use a more modern idiom, a false theodicy would be a kind
of ideology.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
The second of these two jointly necessary conditions is indispensable,
because Hegel understands actuality to be an objective correlate of
subjective human freedom or what he calls "<i>the right of the subjective
will</i>" (<i>EPR</i><i>,</i> 158-59). Human beings are free to the extent
that only those things that they can recognize as rational&#8212;and
this applies across the board to institutions, laws, practices, beliefs,
emotions and feelings&#8212;have authority over them. If something claims
authority on the basis of its mere existence, then that authority is,
to use an expression of Hegel's youth, "positive" or dogmatic; it is a
form of domination and unfreedom. Hegel often makes this point in another
way. He contends that human subjectivity (or the "I") is free when it is
"at home" in the world and that, "'I' is at home in the world when it
knows it, and even more so when it has comprehended it" (<i>EPR</i>, 36).
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 That is, the rational human subject is "at home" or most free, where
 it is in its own element, the element of objectified human reason. In
 other words, human subjects are "at home" in actuality. There is a
 lot to be said about Hegel's multifaceted conception of freedom.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Suffice it here to say that, practically and politically speaking,
 Hegel's claim is that subjects are "at home" only when they can
 recognize&#8212;i.e. understand and affirm the underlying rationale
 of&#8212;the laws, customs, practices and institutions under which
 they live. And they can recognize and affirm these laws etc. because
 they in turn are the product of rational human subjects. For Hegel,
 it is historically the case in modern times that the <i>actual</i>
 customs, practices and institutions that shape the lives of subjects
 enjoy authority and deserve respect only in virtue of their underlying
 rationality. Laws, for instance, have to win acceptance insofar as
 they manifestly satisfy the interests of those subject to them.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 "The principle of the modern world requires that whatever is to be
 recognized by everyone must be seen by everyone as entitled to such
 recognition" (<i>EPR</i>, 355).
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The situation in which we modern (i.e. post French-revolutionary,
post-Kantian) subjects find ourselves, is one in which many good
institutions have already been established through the historical and
cultural labor of spirit, but in which there is still a lot of work to
do, not least the intellectual task of recognizing what has already been
achieved. For the underlying rationality of actual institutions does not
lie on their surface; it is buried within them. This is why Hegel insists
that we modern subjects need not religion, but a Science of Right, the
task of which is to uncover and to make public the implicit rationality
of custom and law.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 "For what matters is to recognize in the semblance (Schein) of the
 temporal and transient the substance which is immanent and the eternal
 which is present" (<i>EPR</i>, 20).

<p>
Thus in Hegel's view philosophical metaphysics&#8212;the recognition of
the rational in the actual and, more broadly, the discrimination between
actuality and mere being&#8212;has an historical and social task to
fulfil. It is the task of perfecting the development of the objective
human spirit towards the ends of freedom and reconciliation&#8212;to
show Hegel's audience (in Berlin of the early 1820s) that they can be
"at home" in their world.

<b></b>

Beyond this, the modes of absolute spirit, art, religion and philosophy,
have the further task of making known that what is thus at home in the
world is spirit or mind, and that in recognizing the rational in the real,
self-knowing spirit recognizes nothing but itself.

2 Negativity and Immanent Criticism:<br />
Adorno's Inverted Hegelianism
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
I now want to locate the fundamental differences between Adorno's
philosophy and Hegel's. The most noticeable and obviously important
difference between Adorno's social philosophy and Hegel's is that Adorno
conceives immanent criticism as radically negative; it aims to condemn
existing unreason rather than to recognize and affirm the rational in
the actual. Typically, Adorno reaches this <i>prima facie</i> un-Hegelian
position not through a rejection of Hegel's ontotheology, but through a
dialectical inversion of it. According to Hegel actuality spreads out
along the axis of its underlying rationality, while "lazy" existence
tends when all goes well to lapse into non-existence. But Adorno realizes
that the fundamentally irrational institutions that in Hegel's eyes are
merely lazy have their own survival mechanisms, including the ability
to cloak themselves in the appearance of rationality. One example is the
institution of free wage labor which, though it serves only the dominant
interests of the capitalist class who exploit the free wage laborers by
appropriating the surplus value they produce, nonetheless appears to serve
the interests of all, including those who only have their labor power
to sell. Moreover, just as one actual institution, according to Hegel,
begets another, so, according to Adorno, one irrational institution tends
to beget another. The illusory reasons for the existence of one irrational
institution encourage other irrational institutions into being. Thus
consumer capitalism begets the leisure industry, which encourages people
to waste their free time pursuing inherently worthless activities, merely
in order to recreate their spent labor power, a process which in turn
fuels the economic system. Whilst Hegel believes that "lazy existence"
at worst hampers the development of actual institutions and hinders
the progress of spirit, Adorno urges that the influence of irrational
institutions is altogether more sinister and damaging.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 They destroy human freedom and erode the capacity to recognize and
 resist the advance of unfreedom. Indeed, Adorno contends that in
 consumer society the depredations of modern capitalism have pushed
 back the frontiers of actuality until virtually none remains. In
 the beginning of <i>Minima Moralia</i>, Adorno describes in horror
 a world in which "people who are no more than component parts of
 machinery act as if they still had the capacity to act as subjects,
 and as if something still depended on their actions" (<i>MM</i>,
 15). This is the reality of living in a "totally administered" and
 "radically evil" world.

<p>
This line of thought has led from a claim about the absence of actuality,
to one about the presence of radical evil, a move that requires some
explanation. Whether in his philosophical, sociological or his more
personal and anecdotal writings, Adorno never hesitates to use terms
like "evil" (das B&ouml;se), "absolute evil" (das B&ouml;se)(<i>DA</i>,
151/168), "the bad" (das Schlechte) (<i>ND</i>, 128 [122]) and "the
radically evil world" (die radikal b&ouml;se [Welt]) (<i>ND</i>, 374
[381]) and thus to take metaphysical (not to say theological) hostages
to fortune.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
There is a rather complicated story to tell here that links Adorno's use
of the term "radical evil" with Kant's in the <i>Religion Within the
Limits of Reason Alone</i>. Kant claims that evil is a metaphysical
property of the will, which explains people's apparently natural
predisposition voluntarily, through weakness, selfishness or wickedness,
to act heteronomously by pursuing ends given by sensible inclinations.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 For Adorno, evil refers to the widespread and systematic tendency for
 people to choose their own unfreedom by adjusting to and accepting
 socially given norms and by pursuing socially given ends.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Although both Kant and Adorno understand evil in terms of heteronomy
 or unfreedom, Adorno tends to attribute evil to the social mechanisms
 which encourage people to engage in heteronomous behavior, whilst
 Kant attributes evil to the deficiency of the individual's will,
 which predisposes him to overlook autonomous morality and to follow
 the promptings of inclination instead.

<p>
In general, Adorno appears to hover between two rather different views
of the endemic evil of the social world. The stronger, more pessimistic
view is that there is no good in the world, apart from the knowledge
that there is no good in the world. The weaker, less pessimistic view,
is that there are fragments of the good in the world&#8212;for example
the experience of pleasure granted by certain works of art, some kinds
of philosophical reflection, and certain spontaneous expressions of
human warmth and love&#8212;but only enough to allow us to notice their
absence from the social totality. They are the exception, not the rule,
of social reality; points of resistance to it, not its basis. Depending
on the context, Adorno slides between these two views. Common to both,
though, is the firm belief that the present situation is parlous.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Under such unpromising historical conditions the metaphysical project
metamorphoses. For Hegel, the task of philosophy was still to recognize
the rationality in the actual. But by Adorno's lights, a philosophy aimed
at recognizing the rational in the actual would be otiose: for there is no
(or virtually no) rational actuality.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Moreover, a philosophy whose task was to recognize the rational in
 present non-actual reality would be worse than otiose; it would be
 a false theodicy or ideological illusion, wholly complicit with the
 structures of domination it analysed. It would be a philosophy that
 offered spurious justifications for the existence of a fundamentally
 irrational reality. In order to avoid that fate, philosophy
 under present conditions must remain content with recognizing the
 irrationality at the heart of an antagonistic society; it must remain
 true to itself by contemplating not the true and the good, but the
 untrue and the bad.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What remains the same as itself, pure identity, is the bad. Mythical
fate is timeless. Philosophy was its slave, insofar as it, right up to
the theodicies of Leibniz and Hegel, interpreted the immutable, with
gargantuan euphemism, as the good. If one were to draw up an ontology
which accorded with the basic fact, which through constant repetition
becomes invariant, then that fact would be horror (das Grauen). (
<i>ND</i>, 128 [122])
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Accordingly, Adorno's philosophy not only has a different object to
Hegel's, it has the opposite social objective. Where Hegel seeks to
reconcile modern subjects to their world, by identifying the rational
in the actual, Adorno's ontology of the false state of things seeks to
alienate modern subjects from a social world that no longer merits

<b></b>

their recognition, by making them consciously unhappy with it. While the
task of Hegel's social philosophy is ultimately affirmative, the task
of Adorno's social philosophy is ultimately negative. Though it remains
within the same general metaphysical or ontotheological framework as
Hegel's, Adorno's social philosophy has the opposite evaluative polarity.

<p>
Now we are in a position to ask whether this most characteristic feature
of Adorno's philosophy&#8212;its negativity&#8212;can throw any light
on the normative basis of his social criticism. It is natural to think
that it might. Consider the view propounded both by Adorno and by many
of his critics that he is doing something called "immanent criticism,"
which needs no moral foundations and which is thus unlike external and
moralising criticism. On this view, what Adorno does is to show the
general and widespread assumption that the institutions and practices
that shape social life are good&#8212;that they in fact satisfy people's
fundamental interests&#8212;to be an illusion. Further, Adorno shows that
this illusion is necessary to the persistence of the social system. In
so doing, Adorno supposedly only measures presently existing society
against its own implicit normative or evaluative claims, but makes none
of his own. Therefore it is claimed that Adorno's criticism is not empty,
and the normative constraints it exerts are not external impositions on
the objects of criticism.

<p>
We can illustrate this minimal conception of immanent criticism with
an example. Adorno, like Marx, aims to show that although capitalist
relations of production appear to be a free and equal exchange of labor
power for wages, this appearance of equality is an illusion, due partly
to the nature of what is exchanged and partly to the circumstances under
which the exchange takes place. Adorno uncovers a kind of discrepancy
between social reality and people's understanding of it. He shows that
the appearance of capitalist exchange relations are deceptive, that both
parties are deceived about their true relation to each other, that they
believe "the lie of equality."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 He adds that neither party realizes the "injustice" of the exchange,
 and that this ongoing mutual deception maintains the practice and
 drives the process of the accumulation of capital, which ultimately
 blights both their lives.

<p>
One difficulty with the minimal conception is that it is vulnerable to
a version of G. E. Moore's open question argument. It leaves unanswered
the question whether or not this deceptive practice is <i>morally</i> bad
or wrong. Because it leaves that question open, the minimal conception
fails to square with Adorno's critical practice. For Adorno's writing
leaves us no doubt that the deceptive practice he criticizes is morally
reprehensible; i.e. that it <i>ought</i> not to be as it is. What this
suggests is that, contrary to widespread opinion, indeed contrary to
Adorno's self-estimation, Adorno's criticism is not wholly negative and
not wholly immanent. At any rate, the negativity of Adorno's conception
of criticism taken on its own, grants him no special dispensation to
draw normative conclusions from non-normative premises. Rather, what
entitles Adorno to the normative conclusions he <i>does</i> draw is the
obvious fact (a fact which is often ignored perhaps because it is so
obvious) that his negative conception of immanent criticism depends on
a metaphysical conception of radical evil.

<p>
This may seem controversial. Many contemporary commentators would
like Adorno to have no truck with any kind of metaphysics, let alone a
metaphysics of good and evil.

<b></b>

This seems to stem from the desire on the part of commentators to
make Adorno relevant to contemporary philosophical concerns by keeping
his metaphysical commitments as low as possible. Unlike Nietzsche and
Heidegger, however, Adorno does not think that metaphysics is something
that can or must be avoided at all costs. In the <i>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</i>, he and Horkheimer criticize Enlightenment thinking
for neutering rationalist metaphysics. They are far more scathing
about contemporary forms of nominalism and scientism. The latter
have abandoned all belief in universals and have lost the capacity to
"betray the injustice of what exists . . . through the incongruence
of concept and reality" (<i>DA</i>, 24, <i>DE</i>, 22-23). Presumably
this is what he thinks that he and Horkheimer are doing&#8212;betraying
present injustice by bringing to light the incongruence of concept and
object. In other words, Adorno admits that, despite the distance between
them, there is an affinity between critical theory and rationalist
metaphysics. Furthermore, the "injustice" of which Adorno speaks has
a normative dimension. The "injustice of what exists" is nothing less
than the failure of the positive concepts "good," "right," "fair,"
etc. to correspond to a reality that is radically evil.

<p>
To see this we need only consider the role that evil plays in Adorno's
qualified rehabilitation of metaphysics at the end of <i>Negative
Dialectics</i>. The "Meditations on Metaphysics" consists in a
contraposition of dialectical opposites: Kant's transcendent metaphysics
on the one hand and the event of Auschwitz on the other. According to
Kant, the ideas of reason correspond to nothing in experience, yet they
provide rational answers to questions that finite beings cannot help
but ask. To cut a long story short, the ideas of reason are like a set
of focal points ideally projected beyond the horizon of experience,
which provide practical orientation for finite beings in the world of
appearances. For Adorno, the significance of Kant's ideas is threefold:
they signify  that metaphysics is ineliminable from theory; 
that complete despair or nihilism is ultimately unthinkable, and 
that practice is prior to theory (<i>ND</i>, 375-77 [381-84]). On the
other hand, Adorno's meditations respond to the historical phenomenon of
Auschwitz. The re of Auschwitz in Adorno's work should be understood
as a synecdoche for the barbaric, inhuman, and ultimately murderous
treatment of millions of people that took place in the ghettos and the
concentration and death camps under the Third Reich. The significance of
Auschwitz, thus understood, is twofold: it represents the simultaneous
culmination and betrayal of enlightenment. Auschwitz is a betrayal
of enlightenment because it violated the humanitarian ideals of the
historical Enlightenment in an abhorrent and devastating manner. It is
the culmination of enlightenment because in that very devastation it
revealed what enlightenment always was: instrumental rationality run
wild, technological domination and social oppression masquerading as
reason and freedom. Adorno's strategy in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>
is to confront Kant's ideas and postulates&#8212;the empty promises
of enlightenment&#8212;with Auschwitz&#8212;the blind unreason of its
content. This confrontation is supposed to undermine Kant's rationalist
metaphysics and simultaneously to release its truth moment (<i>ND</i>,
400 [408]).

<p>
It turns out, then, that the minimal conception of immanent criticism
is both misleading as a picture of what Adorno is doing, and inadequate
as an explanation of the

<b></b>

normative basis of Adorno's own social criticism. The sense in which
Adorno's criticism is indeed negative is inseparable from the claim
that the world is radically evil. I would hesitate to call such a mode
of criticism "immanent." At very least I want to say that this version
of criticism is much richer than the minimal conception of immanent
criticism. For this reason, Adorno's metaphysics of radical evil is a
promising basis for further inquiry into the question of what is the
normative or evaluative basis of his social philosophy.

3 Mimesis, Rationality and Modern Art
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
So far, I have tried to show how in certain respects Adorno's underlying
metaphysics is a dialectical inversion of Hegel's ontotheological
project, but I have said virtually nothing about modern art. The general
discussion of Adorno's metaphysical project has, though, set the stage
for an understanding of Adorno's central thesis about the philosophical
significance of modern art. For Adorno the philosophical significance
of art lies in its capacity to embody and to disclose a certain kind of
metaphysical experience. He calls this capacity "mimesis." Throughout
his work, Adorno appeals to an original mimetic relation between thought
and things. His conception of mimesis is characteristically plastic, and
quite a lot of interpretative work is needed to uncover its philosophical
significance.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Here, rather than focusing on the general concept of mimesis, I want to
 draw attention to one of its particular instantiations, which Adorno
 calls the shudder (Schauder/Schauer), a term which occurs both in
 <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> and <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>.

<p>
In the crucial opening section of the earlier work Adorno, drawing
heavily on studies in the history of religion and anthropology, develops
a conception of enlightenment thinking from a reconstructed prehistory
of rationality.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 Roughly speaking, Adorno divides human development into five stages,
 although the division is implicit rather than explicit, and the
 boundaries more vague than the following reconstruction suggests:

<p>
1. The first is a pre-animistic stage in which the world is governed by
a principle of mana which is primary and undifferentiated.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 Adorno says little about the structure of preanimistic society,
 apart from the fact that every member participated in the process of
 altering nature. He <i>does</i> say that mana is born from the shudder
 (Schauder) in the face of the unknown, and that it contains the germ
 of the division between subject and object, because according to the
 principle of mana things are not experienced directly as what they are,
 but as the seat of something else, mana.

<p>
2. In the second, <i>animistic</i> stage, human beings begin to populate
the world with named deities. Through language and the mimetic power of
magic they attempt to gain control of their environment. "The cry of fear,
with which the unfamiliar is experienced becomes its name. It fixes the
transcendence of the unknown over against the known, and thereby fixes
the shudder as something sacred" (<i>DA</i>, 17, <i>DE</i>, 15). Primitive
forms of thought thus distance the knower from the known and provide the
first doubling of nature into appearance (or illusion) and essence, which
provides the incipient basis first of myth and then of natural science.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 In so doing, language and magic give the class of priests and magicians
 privileged access to the supernatural

<b></b>

powers, and create a social hierarchy which from now on begins to entwine
itself around the relation of human beings to the world.

<p>
3. In the third stage myth, story-telling and collective memory emerge
as an inchoate form of rationality. Myths attempt to subdue the unknown
external world by imposing a kind of natural order upon its infinite
variety and unpredictability. However, the "repetition of nature"
which mythical symbols represent always turn out to be "the represented
permanence of social coercion"(<i>DA</i>, 23, 28, <i>DE</i>, 20, 27).

<p>
4. In the fourth stage, metaphysics replaces myth as the best means
of coming to understand and exert control over external nature. The
difference is that metaphysics uses universal concepts rather than stories
and images. Nonetheless these universals are just as much concealed
forms of domination as their precursors (<i>DA</i>, 23, <i>DE</i>,
21). But metaphysics retains a vestige of its social origins in so far
as it still aims at discovering a truth that transcends existent reality.

<p>
5. Finally, even metaphysics is overcome as enlightenment triumphs in the
form of an all-encompassing instrumental rationality, which is totally
in thrall to the status quo epistemically and politically. Adorno's
favorite examples are the natural sciences and the logical positivism of
the Vienna School. But almost any kind of formal system of reasoning,
from mathematics to logic, or any kind of technological application of
scientific knowledge, counts as an instance of enlightenment, since
their sole aim, according to Adorno, is to describe existent reality
and not to criticize it. Thus they end up slavishly subservient both
to external nature and to extant socio-economic relations. Ultimately
enlightenment gives up its quest for universal truths and lapses into a
quietistic form of nominalism: it recognizes only the existence of names,
of conceptually identified objects (<i>DA</i>, 24, <i>DE</i>, 23).
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
According to the anthropological story told here, the shudder arises as
the response to an originary imposition of non-identity. As befits the
origin of a dialectic, otherness (das Ungewohnte/Unbekannte) plays a dual
role in Adorno's thought: it is both the danger and the saving power of
modern life, the threat of extinction and the possibility of redemption.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The experience of shudder mirrors this dual structure. On the one
 hand the impulsive response of taking flight is a negative response
 to an unknown and potentially hostile other. It is the origin of
 what Horkheimer (following Weber) calls instrumental reason, and of
 what Adorno later calls identity-thinking. The distancing operation
 of conceptual, reflective thought is the means by which the subject
 attempts to subdue and tame the experience of shudder by controlling
 and mastering what provoked it. On the other hand the shudder is,
 epistemically speaking, a positive experience that is true to what
 is there prior to conceptual identification&#8212;the amorphous, the
 undifferentiated, the strange. It is an impulsive somatic experience
 that momentarily registers the presence of what occasions it. It thus
 stands in a more intimate relation to its other (to the non-identical)
 than concepts and categories do.

<p>
In <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, Adorno appears to be making an
historical and anthropological claim that the shudder lies at the origins
of human rationality in the practices of magic.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 At the same time, though, he insists that these origins are
 irretrievable. There is no way back to primordial non-differentiation
 once reflection and

<b></b>

rationality have set in. At best, the shudder represents an
acknowledgement of a now lost and quite different relation to nature
than that of the knowing subject to the known object. In his later work,
Adorno extends his conception of the shudder. In <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>,
he claims that works of modernist art, in virtue of their characteristic
autonomy, can successfully capture and impart the shudder.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Here the shudder is not just a response to primal amorphousness and
 non-differentiation; it is the appropriate response to the abstract
 nature of modern life: "The shudder is a reaction to the cryptically
 shut, which is a function of that element of indeterminacy. At the
 same time however, the shudder is a mimetic comportment reacting
 mimetically to abstractness" (<i>AT</i>, 20). As we have seen the
 abstractness of modern life, its invariance, its universality, its
 (virtual) absence of particularity, its characteristic lifelessness,
 is what Adorno calls "the horror" (das Grauen).
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 The shudder is the involuntary and immediate reaction of revulsion,
 which discloses the modern administered world as radically evil.

<p>
This metaphysical claim provides the framework for Adorno's phenomenology
of modern art. In Adorno's view, works of art succeed only to the extent
that they defeat our cosy aesthetic expectations that they should occasion
pleasure. A successful work of modern art survives its assimilation to the
functional totality&#8212;its relegation to mere entertainment&#8212;by
becoming difficult, introverted, dissonant, shocking. At the same time, it
is a work of art and like all works of art has an ineliminable affirmative
moment, which Adorno (citing Baudelaire)calls "the promise of happiness."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Modern artworks ironically fulfil this promise of happiness precisely
 by delaying and withholding the promised satisfaction. For example,
 Adorno claims, Sch&ouml;nberg's <i>Pierrot Lunaire</i> shows that "there
 is more joy in dissonance than in consonance" (<i>AT</i>, 40). The
 importance of Adorno's argument in <i>Aesthetic Theory</i> is that an
 admittedly rather narrow canon of modernist, avant-guarde works of art
 protect the weak flame of metaphysical experience, the experience of
 an alternative relation to things and to nature of which human beings
 have otherwise been deprived by the depredations of modern life.

4 Metaphysical Experience:<br />
Shudder as Inverted Wonder
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The shudder, then, is not just a mimetic reaction to primary,
undifferentiated otherness. It is also, and more importantly for our
purposes, a spontaneous and somatic response of revulsion at the world of
"universal fungibility," i.e. at a world which has been systematically
denuded of intrinsically valuable ends and activities, and in which
everything of value is only valuable as a means for something else. This
world of "universal fungibility," is the objective counterpart of the
concept of identity. To think conceptually is to subsume particulars under
a general concept. Qua instances of a more general concept, particulars
are made equal to, and infinitely substitutable for, one another.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 In <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, Adorno calls this kind of knowing
 "identity-thinking." All thought is conceptual, and conceptual
 thought is by its very nature identifying. This process of identifying
 particular things as tokens of more general types fixes and stabilizes
 meanings, rendering them more useful for the purpose of predicting
 and controlling nature. Adorno holds that this is the basic process
 behind the process

<b></b>

of reification, i.e. the domination of use-values by exchange-values
that is characteristic of the commodity form.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

<p>
Even in this second sense the shudder is complex; it is not simply a
negative response of flight from reality. The shudder fulfils a positive
epistemic function. It is the gateway to the path of truth. The shudder
allows what is to disclose itself in truth as radically evil. It is the
form which metaphysical experience assumes under social conditions of
universal fungibility or total identity. Earlier, I argued against the
view that Adorno's social philosophy can be understood as a kind (the
minimal kind) of immanent criticism. There is, though, still a sense in
which Adorno's social criticism deserves to be called "immanent." Insofar
as it is form of normative or evaluative social criticism Adorno's
philosophy is nonetheless internal to what he calls metaphysical
experience, namely to a particular kind of somatic, non-conceptual,
experience of the world. As an experience of horror, of the radically evil
nature of the social world, it is essentially evaluative. It is, then, in
this sense a metaphysical theory, rather than a moral or ethical theory,
that provides the normative basis of his social theory. The relation
between the normative/evaluative and the metaphysical aspects of Adorno's
social philosophy becomes clearer once one understands the way in which
metaphysical experience connects with the conception of radical evil.

<p>
Earlier, I presented Adorno's metaphysics as a dialectical and axiological
inversion of Hegel's ontotheology. If we step back from Adorno's
interpretation of his own work, we can see how it reflects a tradition
of metaphysics much older and broader than the German Idealist tradition.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 For the present purpose I shall call this tradition <i>classical
 metaphysics</i>. I take the deliberately broad and rather vague
 term <i>classical metaphysics</i> to include a whole tradition of
 metaphysical thinking from Aristotle through to Hegel. <i>Classical
 metaphysics</i> understands itself as a philosophical theory of what
 is. Kant's transcendental idealist view of metaphysics as a doctrine
 of categories and of ideas and their relation to the empirical world
 is, on this view, a variant of classical metaphysics. Hegel sits more
 firmly within the tradition of <i>classical metaphysics</i> than does
 Kant, because he understands the dynamic interrelation of categories
 and ideas <i>to be the fundamental structure of reality in itself</i>.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 I shall assume that Aristotle's account of the origins of philosophy
 in book I of the <i>Metaphysics</i> is, in a very general way,
 emblematic of the whole tradition of <i>classical metaphysics</i>. In
 this well-known passage, Aristotle shows that philosophy and science
 originate in the experience of wonder/amazement (thauma) at the
 appearance of the world.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
For it is because of wondering that human beings first began to
philosophize and that they still do now . . . Now one who is perplexed
and amazed supposes that he is ignorant, (whence a lover of myths too
is a kind of philosopher), for myth is composed of wonders, so if they
indeed philosophized in order to avoid ignorance, it is clear that they
pursued knowledge for its own sake and not because of some use.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Classical metaphysics</i> in this account begins in the experience of
wonder and puzzlement at the appearance of the world. This experience
prompts the question "why" and sets in train the inquiry into first
causes and principles, a process of inquiry that traces

<b></b>

a path from ignorance to knowledge, in the course of which wonder and
puzzlement are replaced by the contrary state, understanding.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 It is important that the experience of wonder underlying classical
 metaphysics is not evaluatively innocent. Wonder is appropriately
 occasioned by what is worthy of it, at what is truly wondrous. Classical
 metaphysics is thus not neutral as regards the existence of the world:
 it holds that what exists is good, at least in the sense that it is
 worthy of contemplation.

<p>
When we compare Aristotle's account of the origin of classical metaphysics
with Adorno's account of the origin of rational thought in <i>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</i>, some striking and important parallels emerge. Adorno's
story of the origins of enlightenment thinking is not so much an
historical account of the genesis of rational thought, as an account of
the grounds on which rational thought is based. Like Aristotle, Adorno
holds that philosophy and more broadly conceptual thought arises from
and is based on a kind of originary experience of the world. Adorno's
notion of metaphysical experience resembles Aristotle's also in that
it is also not evaluatively innocent. The significant difference is
that Adorno's philosophy arises from and is based on the metaphysical
experience of a corrupt and debased world: in the aftermath of the Third
Reich, and of the reifying effects of consumer capitalism, the world no
longer gives rise to <i>thauma</i>. On the contrary, as Adorno makes
clear in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, the false ontology, the reality
of a totally administered world, is a kind of horror epitomized by the
death camps. Shudder, then, is a response arising from the metaphysical
experience of a world characterised by horror (das Grauen). Shudder
is the equivalent in the modern, disenchanted, capitalist world of the
classical metaphysical experience of wonder: it is the gateway to the
path of truth; but the truth to which it leads is the awful one that
the social world is radically evil.

<p>
Adorno thinks that the world is not wondrous, but that even if it were,
human beings would not be capable of wondering at it. For human subjects
have been so homogenized and stupified by mass culture, their subjectivity
has been so reified by exchange relations, so stultified by rampant
consumerism, that their capacity to experience wonder has atrophied.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 (Of course, because the world is not wondrous anyway, their incapacity
 for wonder is not a detectable problem.) But the situation is worse
 than that. The modern subject's capacity to shudder has been all but
 eroded. In <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, Adorno claims that the albeit
 self-inflicted damage to our rational and sensible capacities is so
 extensive that even the human capacity for shudder, the capacity
 to experience the true <i>horror</i> of the world for what it is,
 may disappear.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 In which case our only access to the truth will disappear with it.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If at one time human beings in their powerlessness against nature
feared the shudder as something real, the fear is no less intense,
no less justified, that the shudder will dissipate. All enlightenment
is accompanied by the anxiety that what set enlightenment in motion
in the first place and what enlightenment ever threatens to consume,
may disappear: truth. (
<i>AT</i>, 80)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Fortunately, Adorno thinks that the capacity for shudder has not yet been
<i>completely</i> extinguished from human life. One reason why Adorno
values modern art so highly is that when all goes well it manages to
preserve and to communicate the shudder

<b></b>

even under social conditions that militate against experiences of
truth. Whilst this is so, it is the primary task of philosophy to
interpret that metaphysical experience, and thus to keep alive the
possibility of true social criticism. In this respect the shudder has
a positive epistemic and practical significance for Adorno.

<!--_a-head-->
5 Metaphysical Experience and Bourgeois Coldness
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The metaphysical role of shudder as inverted wonder provides a clue to
the normative/evaluative basis of Adorno's social criticism. Metaphysical
experience is an experience of reality interpreted mimetically into
the appropriate evaluative reaction. The two moments of experience and
interpretation are coeval and reciprocal. In Adorno's view what experience
delivers is always already moralized or evaluated. There are no neutral
facts that are not already morally or evaluatively interpreted. Adorno's
view is very different from the Kantian picture he attacks, in which the
moral will imposes order on an external manifold of sensibility. According
to the Kantian picture, the moral value of an action consists solely in
its being an expression of the pure rational will. A particular action has
value insofar as the maxim on which it is based is universally applicable
and insofar as the maxim is adopted in virtue of its universal form. For
Adorno, by contrast, moral rules are at best ancillary. What is paramount
are the underlying goods the rules protect and the evils they prohibit. At
worst the rules themselves are part of the problem.

<p>
Adorno's chief complaint against Kant is not that his moral theory is
phenomenologically inaccurate. On the contrary, Adorno accepts that
Kant's theory is a correct description of the historical phenomenon
of <i>bourgeois</i> morality, but he thinks that there is something
deeply wrong with that very morality. He thinks that Kantian moral
agents, because they are required (or require themselves) to follow
universalizable rules and to act in conformity with and out of duty,
become detached from and indifferent to the underlying goods the rules
protect and the underlying evils they prohibit.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
 Ultimately, their moral sensibilities are blunted. They become
 insensitive, cold, indifferent to things and to one another. Adorno
 thinks this weakness in Kantian morality is evidenced by the moral
 catastrophe in Germany under the Third Reich. The "coldness" or
 "indifference" of law abiding, middle-class German citizens contributed
 to the collective hemorrhaging of their moral sensibility, and helped
 turn ordinary individuals into Hitler's blind followers and willing
 executioners. As he puts it in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, coldness is
 "the basic principle of bourgeois subjectivity . . . without which
 Auschwitz would not have been possible" (<i>ND</i>, 356 [363];
 <i>CM</i>, 201).

<p>
In spite of his criticisms and reservations about Kant's conception of
ethics, however, Adorno firmly believes both that Kantianism is true of
<i>bourgeois morality</i>, and that moral theory just is Kantianism. He
does not have any alternative moral outlooks or moral theories clearly in
view. Instead of exploring the resources of alternative moral theories, he
looks for an alternative to moral theory. In <i>Negative Dialectics</i>,
Adorno tries, with limited success, to make a critical engagement
with Kant's epistemology serve as this alternative. He attempts not to
revitalise but to overcome Kantian moral

<b></b>

theory by reconnecting it with somatic and immediate experience:
"One ought not to torture: there ought to be no concentration camps. . . These sentences are only true as impulses, when it is reported that
somewhere torture is taking place. They should not be rationalised. As
abstract principles they lapse into the bad infinity of their derivation
and validity" (<i>ND</i>,281 [285]; <i>CM</i>, 202). For Adorno, these
imperatives <i>only</i> have determinate content as immediate responses to
concrete and particular instances of injustice. As such they lack the kind
of natural-scientific lawlikeness that Kant attributes to moral laws: they
are not valid a priori in the way in which Kant thinks all laws must be.

<p>
It is not entirely clear here what position Adorno is arguing for here. It
could be a kind of Rousseauan revaluation of the sentiments. But if so,
it is surely too much to expect that impulses, feelings, etc., simply by
virtue of being unmediated and untainted by reflection and rationality,
will reliably connect with good and evil. Anyway, as we have seen,
Adorno holds that reflection and rationality bar the route back to
immediate experience, so Rousseauanism is not an option. Still it is in
general correct to see Adorno's project as one of reconnecting human
reason&#8212;via the channels of metaphysical experience, especially
the receptive channels of impulses and feelings&#8212;with the goods
the moral laws were supposed to protect. This is all the more daunting,
given that reason, which is itself deeply implicated in the problem of
coldness, cannot be the guiding force of the educative process. Recall
that the goods that Adorno in his more optimistic moments concedes are
still there&#8212;spontaneity, human warmth and affection, sympathy,
artistic beauty, etc.&#8212;are dwindling as identity-thinking in the
shape of scientific and technological advance, consumer capitalism and the
culture industry increasingly determines patterns of human behavior and
thought. Worse still, if Adorno is right, the ideological manipulation
of human sensibility has damaged our ability to detect and respond to
such goods as remain.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 Thus, the present parlous situation cannot be remedied simply
 by educating people to love and to want those goods. Things have
 deteriorated well past the point at which Schiller's idea of an
 aesthetic re-education of sensibility may still have provided a
 solution.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 In "Education after Auschwitz," Adorno laments people's general
 inability to love as well as their general unworthiness to be loved. In
 particular, he notes the failure of the Christian religion to reform
 the coldness or indifference of the bourgeois social order by preaching
 human love and warmth.

<p>
Adorno appreciates these difficulties. He concludes that "the first thing
therefore is to bring coldness to the consciousness of itself, of the
reasons why it arose" (<i>CM</i>, 202). Given the present, disastrous
circumstances the first and most pressing task for philosophy is to
enable subjects to recognize the underlying context of evil. This is
exactly where the shudder, and modern art's peculiar ability to embody
and express it, becomes relevant. Adorno still clings to the belief that
in spite of ideological distortions and the manipulation of sensibility
human subjects have an intuitive ability to detect evil; they know a bad
thing when they see it. Thus, in <i>Problems of Moral Philosophy</i>, he
claims that the "critique of the administered world" must take the form
of "the concrete denunciation of the inhuman." We are in a position to
make such criticisms, he avers, because, even whilst we have no positive
normative conception of humanity

<b></b>

and no positive conception of "absolute goods" and "absolute norms,"
we nonetheless all can and do know intuitively what inhumanity is
(<i>PDM</i>, 260-61 [175]).
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 The normative aim of his social theory is to make people aware of and
 to respond appropriately to the underlying evil, which they have formed
 and which has formed them.

<!--_a-head-->
6 The Fact of Auschwitz
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Of course, it is all too easy to say that the shudder discloses social
reality as radically evil. The question is how does it do this? What
makes it into a reliable mechanism of disclosure? The shudder faces
the same problem as haunts the impulses, and sentiments. How does one
know one is shuddering at the appropriate actions or situations? What
is the basis of Adorno's confidence in it? If Adorno thought on more
Habermasian lines, he might appeal to the criterion of agreement. On such
a view what makes the act of shuddering, say at a particular instance of
gratuitous cruelty, appropriate is the very fact that other things being
equal everyone shudders at that act. But this is not Adorno's view. Given
the homogenizing effect of the ideological illusions propagated by mass
culture, the mere fact that everyone shudders at certain acts, even if
true, is no reliable indication of evil. It may simply reflect a craven
desire for conformity in judgment&#8212;the simple desire not to be out of
step with everyone else. Besides, there simply is no widespread agreement
about the more recondite and contestable normative judgments of Adorno's
social theory, say, that DIY is a depraved form of pseudo-activity,
or that sport is just covert training for work, or that "light music"
is iniquitous. Mere agreement in judgment cannot vouchsafe the truth of
these particular judgments.

<p>
In fact Adorno holds something much closer to the opposite view, namely
that torture and genocide are appropriate objects of shudder because
they are objectively wrong. The criterion of appropriateness is the very
presence of wrongdoing, the existence of evil. Adorno is, after all,
I think, a kind of moral realist.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 I offer two pieces of evidence for this claim. Firstly, Adorno makes
 frequent gestures towards a "materialist" morality, and he does so
 in part because the experience of shudder is a response to something
 other than and independent of itself, to something real. Secondly,
 Auschwitz is the paradigmatic instance of secular evil and Adorno
 obviously does not think that widespread spontaneous revulsion at
 what happened at Auschwitz is what makes it morally wrong. On the
 contrary the evil that Auschwitz objectively is, is what makes the
 shudder appropriate. In fact the re of Auschwitz is the keystone
 of the normative framework of Adorno's social philosophy. This can be
 seen from his remark in the "Meditations on Metaphysics": "Hitler has
 imposed on humankind in the condition of its unfreedom a new categorical
 imperative: to order their thought and actions such that Auschwitz never
 reoccur, nothing similar ever happen" (<i>ND</i>, 358 [365]). Adorno
 certainly means that Auschwitz is objectively wrong, although this
 feeble categorisation is inadequate to the evil it categorises. Adorno
 denies, however, that what made Auschwitz morally wrong is that it
 violated an antecedent moral law. It would be "heinous," he writes,
 to attempt to justify this imperative conceptually.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 Auschwitz res

<b></b>

in Adorno's work as an historical landmark of secular evil, which,
not least because it exceeds and confounds any attempt to understand
its wrongness as a violation of a law, serves as a memorial and
orientation point for metaphysical contemplation. Auschwitz is the fact
of unreason. It requires neither justification nor explanation. Everyone
<i>ought</i> simply to be able to see that Auschwitz is wrong, to feel
the evil that it is. There is nothing to say to someone who cannot,
apart from that their moral sensibility is defective.

<p>
There are two theses here: that the presence of evil is the criterion for
the appropriateness of the shudder; and that Auschwitz is the paradigm
instance of evil. In my view these two theses support the normative
framework of Adorno's social philosophy.

<p>
But this interpretation seems to leave Adorno open to an obvious
objection. It might be plausible for Adorno to suggest that the objective
wrongness of Auschwitz is simply there to be seen; but it is surely
implausible to say that the wrongness of DIY, light music, television,
spectator sports, or jazz is similarly there to be seen. On what grounds
then does he condemn them? Adorno need not claim that these apparently
trifling and harmless components of modern consumer culture are bad per se
and can be known to be bad per se. Adorno need only claim, and indeed does
claim, that Auschwitz is bad per se and can be known to be bad per se. At
the same time, Auschwitz is the result of the tendency of enlightenment
(or identity-thinking) to instrumentalize all relations to others and to
reduce all forms of thinking to the formal calculation of the efficiency
of means. Auschwitz is the culmination of the functionalization of
the social order that ensues when instrumental modes of behavior and
identifying modes of thinking get out of control. Adorno's strategy is to
show that those aspects of cultural and social life that have adapted to
the functionalized social order, even those which fail to resist it, are
complicit with that order. DIY, spectator sports, light music, television
and jazz all lie somewhere on the slippery slope towards the total
elimination of freedom and individuality; they thus condemn themselves
by analogy to the social mores of the Third Reich and to the culture of
Nazism that failed to prevent and in that sense led to Auschwitz.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
On the interpretation I am offering, Adorno's social philosophy implicitly
relies on this kind of analogical argument to give it the considerable
normative force it has. I take it that such arguments are consistent
with Adorno's theoretical practice, if not with every detail of his
own methodological self-understanding. Adorno's conception of radical
evil can be made intelligible and plausible through the real historical
example of Auschwitz, the perpetration on an unprecedented scale of the
kind of violence and mutilation that matters most, physical violence
to other human beings. The new categorical imperative testifies that
Adorno believed that such secular evil might well reoccur. The same
fear haunts his writings on education. Adorno does not make autonomy
(M&uuml;ndigkeit) into the aim of all education after Auschwitz because he
believes it to be a fundamental good, but because he believes that under
present circumstances it is the only human virtue, the exercise of which
may at least prevent the reoccurrence of such evil. Thus Adorno claims:
"The single genuine power standing against the principle of Auschwitz is
<i>M&uuml;ndigkeit</i>, if I might use the Kantian expression: the power
of self-determination, of not cooperating" (<i>CM</i>, 195). Only those
individuals who can think for themselves and who have the capacity for
critical self-reflection 


<b></b>

stand a chance of resisting integration into
the functional order and of escaping the relapse into barbarism.

<p>
If my interpretation is correct, there is heavy empirical and sociological
burden on Adorno's social philosophy. His analysis of society must
convincingly demonstrate the thoroughgoing similarities between the
microstructure of post-war consumer culture in America and Europe and
the features of bourgeois culture that allowed Auschwitz to happen. It
is hard to see how it can bear that weight. From our present perspective,
three decades after Adorno's death, it seems implausible that he pursues
those analogies right into the apparently trifling and harmless details
of everyday life. This may explain why commentators are so ready
to interpret these analogies as nothing more serious than ingenious
rhetorical exaggerations. In my view, by contrast, when Adorno in his
essay "On the Fetish character in Music and the Regression of Listening"
compares the cult of the conductor to that of the <i>F&uuml;hrer</i>,
when he claims in the <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> that enlightenment
"behaves towards things as a dictator behaves towards people; it knows
them insofar as it can manipulate them," and when he compares jazz
enthusiasts to the blind followers of totalitarian regimes, he means
it literally.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 The exaggerations are not only meant to be true, they are not strictly
 speaking even exaggerations. The claims of Adorno's social philosophy
 may be outlandish, but he believed its outlandishness to be commensurate
 with and justified by the extremity of the extant evil. Deflationary
 interpretations do Adorno a disservice by interpreting these apparent
 analogies between Nazism and the consumer culture of America and
 later of West Germany as stylistic exaggerations of more modest and
 empirically defensible claims. To my mind, this domesticates and
 trivializes Adorno's real concerns and, instead of making his social
 criticism relevant, robs it of its normative basis.

<p>
I do not deny that Adorno, as a German-Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute;,
may have had very compelling psychological motives for judging Western
capitalist culture in the way he did. Nor do I mean to underestimate
how closely American society may have resembled the Third Reich in
certain respects during the McCarthy era and the Cold War. It is Adorno's
considerable achievement to have paid rigorous critical attention to the
minute, unobvious cultural conditions of political and social catastrophe.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Nevertheless, I think it obvious that the normative force of Adorno's
 social philosophy relies heavily on an alleged network of subtle and
 sinister analogies between Western consumer culture and the Fascism
 of Nazi Germany, many of which cannot be sustained.

<!--_a-head-->
7 Conclusion:<br />
Metaphors of the Absent Good
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The normative basis of Adorno's social philosophy as I have presented
it, depends on two reciprocal and mutually supporting moments: the
re of Auschwitz and the mimetic response of shudder at the horror
of pure identity. These two moments support a framework of arguments
by analogy between the cultural conditions of the elimination of
freedom that ultimately led to the murder of millions of people,
and to cultural conditions of unfreedom in Western consumer culture
that, in Adorno's estimation, threaten to do the same. If I am right,
commentators who attempt to deduce Adorno's 

<b></b>

ethics from his aesthetics,
and critics of Adorno who look for normative ethical assumptions smuggled
in under the cloak of his aesthetics, are looking for the wrong thing
in the wrong place. The answer to the question of the evaluative or
normative basis of Adorno's social philosophy is to be found in his
metaphysical views concerning the existence of secular evil. Moreover,
Adorno's social philosophy, as I have presented it, is consistent with
his philosophical allegiance to Hegel. It is a development of Hegelian
metaphysics. Specifically, it is a dialectical and axiological inversion
of Hegel's thesis that the task of philosophy is to comprehend the
rational in the actual. In turn, this inverted Hegelianism fits within
the broader framework of classical metaphysics which undergoes a further
axiological inversion at Adorno's hands.

<p>
Whilst my interpretation of Adorno here yields a relatively simple
solution to the question of the normative basis of his social philosophy,
it may also be thought to lead to an unpalatable consequence. On
my interpretation, the shudder is the only appropriate response to
Auschwitz. More than that, it is a complex mimetic response in which
negative elements and positive epistemic and practical elements are
intertwined. But this interpretation saddles Adorno with the uncomfortable
implication that Auschwitz&#8212;the paradigm instance of horror&#8212;has
after all some positive, redemptive significance.

<p>
In fact, Adorno can and does face this consequence squarely. Auschwitz is
the historical manifestation of the horror of pure identity. According
to the logic of Adorno's negative dialectic pure identity passes over
into pure non-identity and back again. These two moments, identity and
non-identity stand in perpetual tension. They are not secured within a
more overarching identity as in Hegel's logic. There is then a kind of
non-identity to the re of Auschwitz in Adorno's philosophy, with a
potentially redemptive significance. Auschwitz is a secular evil of such
magnitude that it shatters our moral categories and exceeds our attempts
to comprehend it as the mere violation of antecedent moral laws. This
positive aspect of the shudder consists partly in (but is not exhausted
by) its epistemic significance, namely in the apprehension of the truth
that the world is radically evil. In <i>Minima Moralia</i>, Adorno cites
F. H. Bradley, "Where everything is bad, it must be good to know the
worst" (<i>MM</i>, 83). It is good to know the worst not just because
it is good to have true beliefs. There is a more subtle dialectic in
play. Not even Auschwitz, the ultimate horror, warrants the response of
total despair. Adorno is a brinksman, but he is not a nihilist. So long as
we can know the worst&#8212;that what is, is radically evil&#8212;then not
everything can be irredeemably bad. That is because truth is, in Adorno's
eyes, not just a relation of correspondence to the facts, but, as it is
for Plato, the source of illumination that radiates from the good.

<p>
Adorno does not provide any philosophical discussion of the constellation
of truth, evil and goodness. Instead he has recourse to an intriguing
metaphor in the crucial final section of <i>Negative Dialectics</i>
of a colorless light source, made visible and present only through its
scattered and refracted traces.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Consciousness could not despair over the grey, if it did not harbour the
concept of a different colour whose scattered traces are not absent from
the negative whole. (
<i>ND</i>, 370 [377-78])

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
It is what is possible, never what is immediately actual that blocks
off utopia: thus in the midst of existence what is possible appears to
be abstract. The inextinguishable colour comes from non-being. Thought
serves it, a bit of existence which, negative as always, reaches over
to non-existence. Only the utmost distance would be nearness; philosophy
is the prism which captures its colour. (
<i>ND</i>, 66 [57])
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As metaphors are apt to be, they are more suggestive than conclusive. They
suggest that the good is a source of illumination, invisible apart from
what it falls upon; grey (das Grau) suggests the horror (das Grauen)
of extant evil; philosophy is the prism that scatters the traces of
color; and the colors are the present traces of the absent good. The
suggestion is that philosophical truth is ineliminably related, through
the presence of secular evil, to a good that is at once transcendent and
absent. Here Adorno's criticism decisively departs from Hegel. The color
and the greyness are situated within the existing world. Philosophy,
in its pursuit of truth, tries to think the possibilities that are lit
up by the inextinguishable and invisible light source located on the far
side of the threshold between being and non-being. In this metaphor of
goodness, Adorno is thinking, not with Hegel, but against him, not only in
the manner of his presentation, but in the theological insistence on the
transcendence of the absent good. These metaphors suggest that the evil
we can know always stands in relation to a good that we cannot, and that
the pursuit of truth, even an awful one, is therefore never a worthless
exercise. The irony is that even here, in these metaphors of transcendent
goodness, where Adorno consciously and decisively breaks with Hegel,
there remains an inverse symmetry which testifies that Adorno remains
Hegel's faithful pupil. In his lectures on the history of philosophy
Hegel writes with characteristic provocation that Plato's idea of the
good "is not beyond reality, in heaven . . . the idea is just reality
brought nearer." (<i>W</i> 19: 39) For Adorno, by contrast, the presence
of the evil we can know shows the idea of the good to be remote indeed,
however "only the utmost distance would be nearness" (<i>ND</i>, 66 [57]).

In 1951, Adorno published <i>Minima Moralia: Reflections on a Damaged
Existence</i>, an ensemble of micro-dialectical reflections on the good
life in a post-war consumer society that was, in his view, increasingly
emptied not only of goodness but of vitality. See the Dedication
and the epigraph '"Life does not live' Ferdinand K&uuml;rnberger,"
<i>Minima Moralia</i> (London: Verso 1991), 15-19, hereafter cited
as <i>MM</i>. In 1963, he held a lecture course entitled <i>Probleme
der Moralphilosophie</i>, ed. T. Schr&ouml;der (Frankfurt am Main:
Suhrkamp, 1996), henceforth abbreviated as <i>PDM</i>. This has recently
been translated into English as, <i>Problems of Moral Philosophy</i>,
transl. R. Livingstone, (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2000). Where I give
two references I refer first to the German original and then to the
English translation.

<a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>.
I do not mean moral "autonomy" in Kant's sense, a concept Adorno subjects
to criticism. I mean something more like <i>M&uuml;ndigkeit</i>,
which is sometimes misleadingly translated as "maturity," but means
the capacity to use one's own reason. Adorno takes the term from Kant's
essay "An Answer to the Question 'What is Enlightenment?'" Immanuel Kant,
<i>Political Writings</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991),
54. See my note no. 18 in "Adorno on the Ethical and the Ineffable,"

See Adorno, <i>PDM.</i> See also the first Model in <i>Negative

Reason" <i>ND</i>, 211 [211]. It is not so much an essay on Kant's
practical philosophy as a critical commentary on Kant's metaphysics
of freedom, illuminated by Adorno's interest in psychoanalysis and
social-psychology. Similarly, the 1963 lectures on moral philosophy
contain surprisingly little engagement with the long tradition of moral
philosophy.

<p>
<a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>.
In this essay I shall make no distinction between the normative and
the evaluative. What I say pertains just as much to Adorno's use of
normative moral concepts such as "right" and "wrong" as it does to his
use of evaluative ethical concepts such as "good" and "bad." The same
problem besets Adorno's conception of the good as besets his conception
of the right.

Roughly, we can call a criticism "moralizing" if it presupposes a prior
conception of moral right and wrong or good and bad. I shall explain
what makes a criticism external below.

<p>
<a name="FOOT10" href="#REF10">10</a>.
Hegel's immediate targets here are Plato's recommendations on childcare
and Fichte's unnervingly prescient prescription that criminals should
carry a painted likeness of themselves on their passports, so that they
can be identified at all times. Hegel's point is that the science of right
can do without making such particular and determinate prescriptions. Such
details form part of what he deems to be the "brightly coloured covering"
(bunte Rinde) of the appearance of actuality, not its underlying
rationale.

<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
Shierry Weber Nicholson, translator of Adorno's <i>Hegel: Drei
Studien</i>, refers to Hegel's teaching of the "rationality of the
real." See <i>Hegel: Three Studies</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993),
85. This is an accurate translation of Adorno's very uncharitable
interpretation of Hegel's notorious <i>Doppelsatz</i> as the mere
"justification of what exists" (des Seienden), 82 &amp; 85, but it should
not be mistaken for Hegel's view. Despite Adorno's affinity with Hegel,
he uncritically inherits the conflation of actuality and existence,
along with the conservative and quietistic interpretation of Hegel this
implies. Together they give a very misleading impression of Hegel's
philosophy, albeit one which was widespread among both Old and Young
Hegelians, and which later became more or less standard within Marxism.

<p>

To take a recent example from British political life, whilst the House
of Lords may be said to exist for a reason, namely as a check on the
legislation passed by the House of Commons, the hereditary principle
does not. There is no reason at all in the 21st century why occupants
of the second chamber should be born into this office.

<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
A good example are the cold weather payments which have, due to a decision
of the High Court, found their way into the institution of the British
welfare state. If there is good reason to issue cold weather payments to
women over sixty, there is equally good reason to issue the same payment
to men over sixty, and not only to men over sixty-five.

<p>
<a name="FOOT15" href="#REF15">15</a>.
I have taken up and adapted this way of thinking about Hegel's metaphysics
from Raymond Geuss, whose essays on modern German philosophy in
<i>Morality, Culture, Spirit</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1999) are unrivalled in their perspicuous presentation of difficult ideas.

<p>
<a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>.
The term "theodicy" comes form Leibniz who argues that God's perfection
is such that this world, although it contains evil, is the best world
that it was possible for God to create, because the evil in it is always
accompanied by a greater good. See <i>Leibniz: Selections</i>, ed. Phillip
Wiener (New York: C. Scribner &amp; Sons, 1951), 509-22. This doctrine
is better known for having been mercilessly and unfairly lampooned by
Voltaire in <i>Candide</i> as Dr. Pangloss's panacea that, "all is for
the best in the

<b></b>

best of all possible worlds." (<i>Candide</i>, ed. J. H. Brumfitt,
[Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978, <i>passim</i>]).

<p>
<a name="FOOT17" href="#REF17">17</a>.
In Hegel's eyes, organized religion, predominantly Christianity, has
done most to promulgate this false theodicy. For the Christian religion
has made us think that this world is simply a trial and preparation for
another kingdom, in which our true interests will be satisfied. <i>W</i>,
19: 501. "On the appearance of Christianity it is initially claimed that:
'My kingdom is not of this world.' But the realization of this kingdom
has and ought to transpire in the present world. In other words, laws,
customs, constitutions and everything that belongs to the actuality of
spiritual consciousness should be made rational." See Hegel, <i>History
of Philosophy III</i>, transl. Haldane and Simpson (London: Routledge
and Kegan Paul, 1963 [1892]), 21-22.

<p>
<a name="FOOT18" href="#REF18">18</a>.
Hegel uses the terms "bei sich" and "zu Hause sein." This quotation is
actually taken from theAddition to &#167;4, which is transcribed from the
manuscripts of Hotho and Gans. The words are not by Hegel's own hand,
but they are deemed to be a reliable source. See Translator's Preface,
<i>EPR,</i> xxxv-vii.

<p>
<a name="FOOT19" href="#REF19">19</a>.
See, for example, recent works by Alan Patten, <i>Hegel's Theory of
Freedom</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999); P. Franco, <i>Hegel's
Philosophy of Freedom</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press 1999);
and Frederick Neuhouser, <i>Foundations of Hegel's Social Theory</i>,
(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000).

<p>
<a name="FOOT20" href="#REF20">20</a>.
Hegel thought that in ancient times by contrast the law commanded respect
and veneration in virtue of its mere existence. To illustrate this, he
adduces lines 456-57 of the <i>Antigone</i> by Sophocles, lines that
are spoken by the eponymous heroine. "The heavenly commands are not
from yesterday or today, no they are eternal and nobody knows whence
they came." Hegel <i>W</i> 12: 56. Sophocles <i>The Theban Plays</i>,
transl. E. F. Watling (London: Penguin 1988), 138. See also Hegel,
<i>W</i> 3: 322. "Thus, Sophocles in his Antigone acknowledges as
the gods of unwritten and infallible right (Recht): 'not just today
and yesterday but forever/ they are there, and no-one knows when they
appeared.'" <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, transl. A. V. Miller (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 1977), 261. As Hegel saw it, the main problem of
ancient Greek political life was to make good laws and to establish good
institutions. There apart, political life in Ancient Greece was all the
more straightforward because the Greeks implicitly recognized the mere
existence of institutions and laws. However, Socrates interrupts and
corrupts this happy na&iuml;vete of Greek ethical life, by introducing
into it the principle of critical reflection. Indeed, Hegel believes
that, in no small measure because of the modernizing effects of world
historical res like Socrates, the naive recognition of the mere
existence of customs and laws is no longer possible for modern agents,
who, because they are all critical and reflective, recognize only what
conforms to their reason as having authority over them. The lives of
modern subjects are based on recognition of the <i>reasons</i>for the
existence of institutions.

<p>
<a name="FOOT21" href="#REF21">21</a>.
The passage occurs in the addition to &#167;317. See also the interesting
passage in the introduction to Hegel's lectures on fine art. (Hegel,
<i>W</i> 13: 25): "The reflective culture of our life today make it a
necessity for us in respect of our will no less than of our judgment to
adhere to general points of view and to regulate particular matters
according to them, so that universal forms, laws, duties, maxims
are what have validity as grounds of determination and are the chief
regulative force." Hegel, <i>Introductory Lectures on Aesthetics</i>,
transl. B. Bosanquet (London: Penguin, 1993), 12.

<p>
<a name="FOOT22" href="#REF22">22</a>.
Hegel, <i>W</i> 13: 10, 11 &amp; 17. Notice that Hegel does not say
that the task of philosophy is to create good institutions. That is a
matter for concrete historical practice, which precedes the reflective
task of historical comprehension. In his own time, Hegel endorsed the
reforms undertaken by Stein, Hardenberg, Humboldt, and Altenstein, and
identified these relatively liberal institutions as the <i>actuality</i>
of the Prussian State.

<p>
<a name="FOOT23" href="#REF23">23</a>.
Hegel is not unaware of this. He admits that the accumulation of wealth
leads to the impoverishment of a whole class of people. And he concedes
that the inner logic of civil society leads to the establishing of
colonies. Hegel, <i>EPR</i>, 265-67.

<p>

Generally speaking, I quote from Max Horkheimer und Theodor W. Adorno,
<i>Dialektik der Aufkl&auml;rung</i> (Frankfurt am Main: Fischer
Taschenbuch Verlag, 1985), henceforth abbreviated as <i>DA</i>. Where
possible, I also refer to the English translation<i>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</i>by J. Cumming (London: Verso 1997), abbreviated as
<i>DE</i>.

York: Harper and Row, 1960), 21, 27.

<p>
<a name="FOOT26" href="#REF26">26</a>.
Adorno, <i>Metaphysics: Concepts and Problems</i> (Cambridge: Polity
Press, 2000), 115. I give a much more detailed account of the relation
between unfreedom and radical evil in James Gordon Finlayson "Adorno on
the Ethical and the Ineffable," <i>European Journal of Philosophy</i>
10.1 : 1-25.

<p>
<a name="FOOT27" href="#REF27">27</a>.
Hauke Brunkhorst makes the mistake of not taking Adorno's claim that the
world is radically evil at face value. For example he interprets the
dictum that there is no right way to live a false life to mean "only
that there is no entirely true life in a false life," in other words,
that under present circumstances there is no entirely good way to live a
life. That is an uninteresting and uncontroversial claim, and not what
Adorno is arguing. In the next paragraph, Brunkhorst's interpretation
of Adorno shifts significantly. He attributes to Adorno the claim that
"true life," is not possible "in the case of a completely false life,"
but that a human life that is at least not misspent is nonetheless
still imaginable. This is consistent with the stronger view I have
outlined. Finally, two lines later, Brunkhorst attributes a third
position to Adorno, namley the view that "the damaged life <i>is not
yet</i> the completely false life." This is now more like the weaker
view outlined here. H. Brunkhorst, <i>Adorno and Critical Theory</i>
(Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1999), 64.

<p>
<a name="FOOT28" href="#REF28">28</a>.
For just this reason, Adorno rejects empirical approaches
to sociology. "For the object itself is derivative, secondary,
superficial. Because today the subjects are objects of society, not its
substance." (Adorno, <i>Gesammelte Schriften in zwanzig B&auml;nden</i>,
Vol. 14, ed. R. Tiedemann (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1970-86),
398-99. Henceforth abbreviated as <i>GS</i>. This is an inversion of
Hegel's doctrine in the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>that "substance is
subject," which is just another way of saying that the world basically
consists in rational actuality.

<p>
<a name="FOOT29" href="#REF29">29</a>.
Michael Theunissen observes that the concept of negativity with which
Adorno constructs his dialectic is not the formal negativity of non-being
but rather "the ontic negativity of what ought not to be," namely "the
bad which can only be addressed as false, because he has a concept of
untruth which picks out bad reality." Theunissen, "Negativit&auml;t bei
Adorno," 41-42.

The title of the opening fragment, "Begriff der Aufkl&auml;rung," must be
read as a subjective and objective genetive. It suggests both that the
"concept" in play here is a product of Enlightenment thinking, and that
it takes Enlightenment as its object.

<p>
<a name="FOOT33" href="#REF33">33</a>.
This is implied by the claim that this early principle survives in Greek
religion, where it is projected onto what is "unknown and alien" or what
"transcends experience." (<i>DA</i>, 17, <i>DE</i>, 15).

<p>
<a name="FOOT34" href="#REF34">34</a>.
"The doubling of nature into semblance (Schein) and essence (Wesen). . . which first makes both Myth and science possible, stems from the
human fear which comes to expression in explanation (Erkl&auml;rung)"
(<i>DA</i>, 17, <i>DE</i>, 15).

<p>
<a name="FOOT35" href="#REF35">35</a>.
"Enlightenment finally consumed not just magic symbols but their
descendant universal concepts, and left nothing of Metaphysics in
tact apart from the abstract fear of the collective, out of which it
arose." (<i>DA</i>, 24, <i>DE</i>, 23)

<p>
<a name="FOOT36" href="#REF36">36</a>.
Adorno, like Heidegger before him, alludes to H&ouml;lderlin's ode
"Patmos": "Wo aber Gefahr ist, w&auml;chst das Rettende auch" (Where
there is danger, the saving power increases, too), (<i>DA</i>, 45,
<i>DE</i>, 47).

<p>
<a name="FOOT37" href="#REF37">37</a>.
There are echoes here of Schopenhauer's conception of the primal
differentiation of the will and Vico's theory that language originates
in fear of the unknown, which may well betray Horkheimer's influence.

See the passage from <i>ND</i>, 128 [122], already quoted in section two.

<p>
<a name="FOOT40" href="#REF40">40</a>.
Actually, the quotation is from Stendhal. But Stendhal writes only that
"la beaut&eacute; n'est que la promesse du bonheur." He implies that
beauty is not objective; it lies in whatever is found beautiful

<b></b>

by someone. <i>De L'Amour XVII</i> (Paris: Gallimard, 1980),
58-59. Baudelaire cites Stendhal approvingly when he writes that the
"eternal portion" of beauty is "the soul of art" and the "variable
element" is "its body." <i>The Painter of Modern Life and Other
Essays</i>, ed. J. Mayne(London: Phaidon Press, 1995). The latter is
closer to the thought Adorno has in mind.

<p>
<a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>.
More than any other term for making equal perhaps the Nazi word
"Gleichschaltung" (to force into line, or make something conform) is

<p>
<a name="FOOT43" href="#REF43">43</a>.
I differ from critics like Jay Bernstein who elucidate Adorno's concept
of metaphysical experience with the help of Hegel and Benjamin. Bernstein
interprets metaphysical experience as a relation of self-recognition
in otherness that obtains when one beholds an art-work appropriately,
and which provides an example of a non-instrumental and non-subsumptive
relation to other things and other persons, which has substantive ethical
implications. J. M. Bernstein, "Why Rescue Semblance? Metaphysical
Experience and the Possibility of Ethics," in <i>Adorno's Aesthetic
Theory</i>, ed. Lambert Zuidervaart (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press 1997),
177-212. What worries me about Bernstein's approach, insofar as it is not
just an exposition but an endorsement of Adorno's philosophy, is that,
at bottom, an aesthetic experience is an experience of an object, and
thus does not provide an appropriate model for thinking about ethical
relations, which are essentially relations between persons.

<p>
<a name="FOOT44" href="#REF44">44</a>.
Not for nothing is Hegel sometimes viewed as the Aristotle of the modern
world. I am leaving aside the central scholarly question of whether the
difference between Hegel's and Kant's metaphysics is a difference within
the Kantian paradigm or a difference from it.

<p>
<a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>.
Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> I 2.982b, 10-20. I have altered W. D. Ross's
translation in <i>The Works of Aristotle</i>, Vol. VIII (Oxford:
Clarendon Press, 1928). I cannot begin to offer an adequate exegesis
of this passage, or even attempt to put it into context. I use it here
simply as an illuminating point of comparison between <i>classical
metaphysics</i> and Adorno's metaphysics. Thanks to Niko Strohbach and
Burkhardt Hafeman for help with interpreting this passage.

<p>
<a name="FOOT46" href="#REF46">46</a>.
Aristotle's interesting aside about the <i>philomythos</i> (literally:
the lover of myths) is very interesting and a little puzzling. His point
is that the <i>philomythos</i>, insofar as he too is amazed, is a kind
of <i>philosopher</i><i>.</i> Aristotle is just being respectful of the
mythmaking of the Greek cosmologists who preceded him. He clearly implies
that not just nature but also myths are sources (and appropriate objects)
of wonder. Aristotle shows his metaphysical respect for myth also at
Met. XII, 8 1074b1 where he notes that one ancient myth referred to first
substances as gods. Whilst this subsequently led to a lot of mistaken
anthropological projection, Aristotle claims that the underlying idea
of this myth, that substance is divine, is correct.

<p>
<a name="FOOT47" href="#REF47">47</a>.
On "The Impoverishment of the Subject" and "The Nominalist Aspect"

<p>

Hence, Adorno's judgment that the death camps rendered even the most
basic human fear of death banausic. "Absolute negativity is predictable:
it no longer surprises anyone." (<i>ND</i>, 355 [362]).

<p>
<a name="FOOT49" href="#REF49">49</a>.
Adorno is at this point already reading Kant through his critics
Schiller and Hegel. For Kant, there are no underlying moral goods. There
are conditional goods, which are not yet moral, and there is the one
unconditional moral good, goodwill. But the latter <i>consists in</i>the
subjective act of willing a maxim in accordance with and for the sake of
duty. Hence, the criticism that moral duty is apt to become detached from
the underlying substantive goods and evils, may not in fact apply to Kant.

<p>
<a name="FOOT50" href="#REF50">50</a>.
For example, Adorno interprets the inability of an immigrant he encounters
on the New York subway to return his sympathetic smile as "Hitler's
triumph." "He has not only taken away our country, our language, our
money, but also confiscated that last little smile. The world he has
created will soon make us as evil as he is" (<i>GS</i>, 20: II 585).

<p>
<a name="FOOT51" href="#REF51">51</a>.
Herbert Marcuse is attracted to this Schillerian position in chapter nine
of his <i>Eros and Eivilisation</i> (London: Routledge, 1999), 172-97.

See also <i>CM</i>, 144: "The crisis of the situation is precisely
that while everyone feels the crisis, the words bringing resolution

He is a moral realist according to Geoffrey Sayre-McCord's definition
of realism, not because he believes that moral properties are located
in the physical world, but because he subscribes to both

<b></b>

meta-ethical cognitivism and success theory. See "The Many Faces of Moral
Realism," in <i>Essays on Moral Realism</i>, ed. Geoffrey Sayre-McCord
(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988), 1-15. Adorno believes that
moral judgments are capable of being true and false, and he believes
that some moral judgments are true.

<p>
<a name="FOOT54" href="#REF54">54</a>.
Adorno may be making the point that the wrongness of Auschwitz is
self-evident and that anyone who needs to be shown by argument why the new
categorical imperative is valid, has a defective moral sensibility. But
I don't think Adorno holds that we don't need the capacity for practical
reason to find out what our obligations are. Such a view is obviously
mistaken. The new categorical imperative implies other obligations, for
example, the obligation not to commit genocide or mass murder. Of course,
that may not be something we need to discover by reason, because genocide
and mass murder are also concepts we already know how to apply. But
eventually we may find that one or other of our intuitively justified
concepts, or a combination of them, has implications or applications to
new situations, which are not immediately obvious. The fact that we have
arrived at these new judgments or norms through reason and reflection
does not itself invalidate them.

<p>
<a name="FOOT55" href="#REF55">55</a>.
For example, Adorno explicitly compares jazz enthusiasts to the blind
followers of totalitarian regimes. "What is common to the jazz enthusiast
of all countries, however, is the moment of compliance, in parodistic
exaggeration. In this respect their play recalls the brutal seriousness
of the masses of the followers in totalitarian states, even though the
difference between play and seriousness amounts to that between life and
death." T. W. Adorno, <i>Prisms</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1983), 128.

<a name="FOOT57" href="#REF57">57</a>.
Of course Adorno was not the only person to make such observations about
the flaws in a culture that made it susceptible to the ideology of the
Third Reich. To take just one example, Viktor Klemperer's diaries are
full of insights that are in many respects close to Adorno's. See in
particular the entries for 18 February and 23 May 1938, and 10 December
1940. Victor Klemperer, <i>Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten:
Tageb&uuml;cher 1933-41</i> (Berlin: Aufbau Verlag, 1996).

See also <i>ND</i>, 396 [404-5]: "No light falls on human beings and
things, in which transcendence does not shine back. In the resistance
against the fungible world of exchange is the indelible resistance of the
eye, which does not want the colors of the world to be obliterated. In
the semblance is the promise of something that is not semblance."

<p>
Stripped down to its essentials, my <i>T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism and
Literary Form</i>  comprises two propositions:  Eliot wrote
anti-Semitic poetry and prose, which makes him an anti-Semite;  Eliot's
anti-Semitic poetry is innovative and imaginative, and therefore cannot be
dismissed as an inconsequential blemish in his oeuvre. Few reviewers were
interested in the second proposition; those who acknowledged it tended to
dismiss it as perverse. The book was read merely as an attack on Eliot,
which was welcome to some, objectionable to others. There is immense
resistance to the simple truth that Eliot wrote anti-Semitic poems. I
do not think that the book has done very much to weaken this resistance.

<p>
That it persists is evident from the following remarks of the literary
scholar and critic, Barbara Everett:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
A part of the literary history of the 20th century was Eliot's gigantic
public status and authority, and the steady collapse of that status and
authority. The collapse has for several decades now been written down
in terms of a discovered or imputed misogyny and anti-semitism. The
assailing of Eliot's reputation is a difficult and vexed matter; a poet
professionally and substantially involved with the society of his time
is likely (however deplorably) to manifest signs of that society's
undoubted misogyny and anti-semitism. But these arguments seem to me
rationalisations for changes of cultural climate and mere fashion. Eliot
remains the superb (if highly individual) poet he always was.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
That is to say: Eliot is out of fashion. Followers of fashion, unable
to escape today's critical wisdom, justify their disregard for him by
reference to anti-Semitism or misogyny. Any argument against his work
will do; they have Eliot's reputation in

<b></b>

their sights. There are those who appreciate and understand Eliot, and
there are those who do not. This latter class misjudge him, and do not
understand their own motives when doing so.

<p>
This is slack reasoning, conducted at that low level at which
the object is not so much to refute an argument as to identify a
discreditable motive. Everett begins sceptically with "discovered or
imputed anti-Semitism"; she concludes with a reluctant acknowledgment
of "signs" of misogyny and anti-Semitism. What may be inferred
from this slippage? The following, I think. An absence of thought
about anti-Semitism; a discomfort with any reasoning about a poet's
responsibility for what he writes, or about the propositional content of
poetry, or how the language of poetry may engage with the discourse of
anti-Semitism; and last, a desire to evade the challenge of readings
that attend to anti-Semitism or misogyny. These readings are "mere
rationalisations." The implication? They not call for an answer, just
a diagnosis.



<p>
The evasiveness of the piece, this reluctance to be forthright about
Eliot's anti-Semitism, seems to me to be typical of the state of Eliot
apologetics at the moment. But occasionally, as if in reaction to such
equivocations as Everett's, an Eliot partisan will insist, with hectic
defiance, that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, in the complaints of
anti-Semitism, and that, indeed, Eliot was if anything a friend to the
Jews. Such is Ronald Schuchard's argument in his lecture "Burbank with
a Baedeker, Eliot with a Cigar: American intellectuals, Anti-Semitism,
and the Idea of Culture." Eliot, Schuchard asserts, was a "philo-Semite"
. He makes this case by:

<p>
(a) <i>a misuse of biographical material</i>, to the effect that Eliot:

<p>
(i) had some Jewish friends and correspondents: Horace Kallen, Sidney
Schiff, Violet Schiff, John Rodker, Jacob Isaacs, Leonard Woolf, Victor
Gollancz, Groucho Marx. Anti-Semites, Schuchard implies, do not have
Jewish friends. He quotes Isaacs to the effect that he "saw no signs of
anti-semitism" (22, n. 20).

<p>
(ii) took steps to assist German Jews persecuted by the Nazi regime: Karl
Mannheim, Adolph L&ouml;we, John Amon&#8212;and there may be others. He
proved himself to be a friend to Jews at a time of need. An anti-Semite,
Schuchard implies, would not behave as he did.

<p>
(iii) championed Isaac Rosenberg's poetry.

<p>
(iv) expressed admiration for Sephardi Jews.

<p>
(v) on several occasions denied that he was an anti-Semite: he was,
Schuchard notes sympathetically, "always faced with the presumption of his
guilt, particularly from academics whose presumption quickly hardened into
fact" . Schuchard endorses Eliot's denials. "There is no anti-semitism
in my poetry whatever," Eliot told a New York correspondent in March 1947
.




<p>
What is one to make of all this? That Eliot had Horace Kallen as a friend
could be interesting, but Schuchard does not himself do enough with
the relationship to make it so. That Eliot responded to Kallen's pleas
on behalf of the German-Jewish intelligentsia <i>is</i> interesting,
and I am glad to learn of it (even though Schuchard talks it up somewhat).

<b></b>

<p>
Many Jews objected to Eliot's anti-Semitism, or the anti-Semitism that
they found in his work. They objected in private communications, in
published correspondence or review, and even in poetry. Schuchard himself
quotes some of these objectors, among them Woolf: "I think T. S. Eliot
was slightly anti-semitic in the sort of vague way which is not uncommon"
(23, n.24). Schuchard wants to rely on Eliot's Jewish friends, but only
up to a point. When they complain about Eliot, he rejects them. It was,
he says, "unjust" of Jews such as Isaiah Berlin to take offence at
Eliot's remark about free-thinking Jews in <i>After Strange Gods</i>
. That is to say: <i>they</i> wronged <i>him</i>.

<p>
There are a number of casual anti-Semitic slurs to be found in Eliot's
published prose and in his correspondence, none of which Schuchard
reproduces. Marx is a Jewish economist, Bodenheim has a hard semitic
bitterness, Jewish philosophy is theological hocus-pocus, psychoanalysis
is a parvenu science.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Eliot wrote to Pound of the Bodenheim family, "being Semites I suppose
 they will survive somehow."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 In March 1915, he wrote to his friend Eleanor Hinkley about the
 "clever Jew undergraduate mind at Harvard, one which evinces wide but
 disorderly reading, intense but confused thinking, and utter absence of
 background and balance and proportion" (<i>L</i>, 92). The "clever Jew
 undergraduate mind" of 1915 will become the "free-thinking Jew" of 1933.

<p>
As for those creepy words of ethnic connoisseurship, "I have always been
attracted by Sephardim" , they derive from a literary clich&eacute;
at least as old as Maria Edgworth's Mr Montenero and Benjamin Disraeli's
Sidonia, the pure Sephardi.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
On Rosenberg, I agree with Frederic Raphael that Eliot's regard for
Rosenberg had much to do with his sense of the poet as combatant-victim
in a war in which he himself had not participated.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Schuchard quotes from a letter of Eliot's to E. M. Forster, though
 without making the connection with Rosenberg: "The War crippled me as
 it did everyone else; but me chiefly because it was something I was
 neither honestly in nor honestly out of . . ." .

<p>
None of the above has any bearing on the interpretation of the
anti-Semitic poetry and prose. Schuchard asks this, wrong question:
"Do we really want to believe that a dominant motive in the poetry
was to exercise a little gratuitous anti-Semitism in the face of his
Jewish friends?"  I suspect that Eliot didn't make the connection
between being unpleasant <i>about</i> Jews in poetry and prose, and
being unpleasant <i>to</i> Jews of his acquaintance. Still: beliefs
about motives are one kind of thing, and interpretations of poems are
quite another.

<p>
Schuchard implies that the miscellany of friendships, admirations and
denials that he has gathered, in itself compels a re-interpretation of
Eliot's anti-Semitic poetry. It does not, for reasons that have to do
both with anti-Semitism and with poetry.

<p>
Anti-Semites habitually make exceptions&#8212;Eliot's included Sephardim
(or what he thought he meant by Sephardim), Isaac Rosenberg, some
German-Jewish intellectuals, and the Schiffs&#8212;who were, he told
his mother, "very nice Jews" (<i>L</i>,400). It would appear that Eliot
mostly confined his anti-Semitism to his work, and committed himself
in his private life to cordial relations with Jews. It might have been
better&#8212;for Jews, at least&#8212;if it had been the other way around.

<p>
Poems need readers to give them contexts in order to make them
intelligible. Schuchard offers a partial biographical context, at each
point asking the reader (in

<b></b>

effect), would this nice man write nasty poems? It is a banal, and
hopeless, endeavour. Poems do not surrender their meanings thus. (In my
book, by contrast, I offer an anti-Semitic context, thereby disclosing
the poems' debts to the tropes that contribute to the discourse of
anti-Semitism).


<p>&nbsp;

<p>
(b) <i>the application of double standards in assessing evidence</i>

<p>
(i) Schuchard writes: "Daily in the <i>Times</i> Eliot had followed
reports of vicious attacks in central European cities on Jewish landlords,
merchants and citizens . . ." . Gerontion's landlord, Schuchard argues,
is one such landlord, sympathetically rendered by Eliot. Two objections
(of several): Schuchard identifies no such <i>Times</i> reports, nor
any evidence to support his statement that Eliot followed them. What
standards of scholarship are being applied here?

<p>
(ii) While Schuchard is ready to infer Eliot's familiarity with newspaper
reports of attacks on Jews in early 1919, he swallows whole Eliot's
bland excuse, offered to Isaiah Berlin, for the "unfortunate statement"
in <i>After Strange Gods</i>, that it would not have been made if he
had been aware of what was happening in Germany.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Does Schuchard think that Eliot stopped reading newspapers in 1933-34?

<p>
(iii) Illustrative of Schuchard's inability to think through the
implications of the material that he himself deploys is his citing
of correspondence passing between Eliot and Kallen about the Nazi
persecutions at the very time that Eliot ". . . prepared <i>After
Strange Gods</i> for press" . Was Eliot lying, then, to Isaiah
Berlin? Schuchard doesn't say.


<p>&nbsp;

<p>
(c) <i>misreadings</i>

<p>
(i) Schuchard puts "Gerontion's" landlord in the company of Europe's
persecuted and dispossessed Jews: "once again pushed with his people
from nation to nation, ghetto to ghetto, Blistered in Brussels, patched
and peeled in London fleeing the horrific pogroms in Poland during the
peace process" .

<p>
This, apparently, is the context in which Gerontion "sees . . . a
squatting Jewish landlord"&#8212;by implication, Brussels and London
were persecution-sites. They were not, of course. But consider, too, the
poem's preceding line: "Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp." Antwerp
cannot be incorporated in Schuchard's misconceived list. It is the
Jewish landlord's&#8212;the jew's&#8212;birth-place, or perhaps one
should write "spawn-place." This is not a line that fits any case
for Eliot's philo-Semitism; Schuchard therefore ignores it. (It is not
persecution that drives this landlord from city to city, but the essential
rootlessness of the Jew, lacking any blood kinship with the communities
among which he moves, and the blistering, patching and peeling, are not
wounds inflicted by pogromists, but badges of disease.)

<p>
(ii) "Burbank," and in particular the lines relating to "piles," "rats,"
and "the jew," prompts Schuchard to write: "Eliot knew the terrible irony
that the new foundations of post-war Europe were being laid on the corpses
of Jews" . It is hard to know what to make of this remark. So far
as can be ascertained, Eliot did <i>not</i> know this to be so, if only
because it is not true. The new foundations of post-World War I Europe
were <i>not</i> laid on the corpses of Jews&#8212;which in any event,
were not buried beneath rats. Only an anti-Semite would write: "the jew."

<b></b>

<p>
(iii) Schuchard says of <i>After Strange Gods</i> that it is not about
Jews as such, but only about "free-thinkers" . To maintain this,
he has to drop "Jews" and "race" from the sentence, and overlook the
other references to race in the lecture: "less invaded by foreign races,"
"landscape . . . moulded by numerous generations of one race." Schuchard
also needs to overlook Eliot's esteem of "the blood kinship of the same
people living in the same place." (He quotes Eliot's lame remark that
he did not know why "race" was there&#8212;but then, nor does Schuchard
himself.)

<p>
Put "Jews" and "race" back into the sentence, acknowledge the
pervasiveness of (a) contemporaneous "numerus clausus"-type restrictions
on Jews and (b) the anti-Semitic account of Jews as free-thinkers
(culturally corrosive sceptics, deniers of Christianity's truth,
etc. etc.), and it is easy enough to get at the truth of Eliot's
recommendation.

<p>
(iv) Schuchard quotes from a letter of Eliot's: "The peace treaty seems
to be held up indefinitely in America. I hope it will not prevent America
from helping in Central Europe; the destitution, especially the starvation
in Vienna, appears to be unspeakable" .

<p>
He inserts the comment, after Central Europe, that Eliot was: "especially
mindful of the plight of thousands of Hasidic Jews who had migrated to
Vienna to join the Jewish population there when Galicia and Bukovina
were taken over by Russia and Rumania during the German surrender" .

<p>
Schuchard offers no evidence to back up this statement&#8212;one,
incidentally, which an inattentive reader might well take for a paraphrase
of something that Eliot himself had written, rather than as a comment
of Schuchard's own. (Another example of a statement unsupported by any
evidence: "He was horrified by what he saw happening to ethnic groups
as territorial boundaries were redrawn by the hands of the Treaty" [5].)


<p>&nbsp;

<p>
(d) <i>under-interpretations and omissions</i>

<p>
(i) By "under-interpretation" I mean this, for example: "[Bleistein's]
stereotypical mannerisms are captured in ferocious caricature"
. Schuchard identifies the poem's Jew-baiting, but without naming it
as anti-Semitic.

<p>
(ii) Schuchard disregards the common literary attribution to Jews
of occultly powerful eyes. This has been noticed often enough by
scholars. Louis Harap, for example, relates it to certain medieval
notions about Jews.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Most literary Jews are given unusual, penetrating eyes. The "dead
 jew's eyes" of "Dirge" and the "lustreless protrusive eye" of "Burbank"
 counter that literary clich&eacute; with sightless, dull eyes. Schuchard
 doesn't know this, or if he does know, doesn't care enough, to address
 this aspect of the poems.

<p>
(iii) He relates "Dirge" to a passage in <i>Ulysses</i> about a drowned
body, but without addressing the differences between the two texts. Each
alludes to Ariel's song in <i>The Tempest</i>, but to contrasting
effect. Only Eliot deforms the song, this deformation reflecting the
violence of his literary rendering of a dead Jew's corpse.

<p>
(iv) Schuchard takes Bleistein (of "Burbank" and "Dirge"), and Phlebas
the Phoenician (of <i>The Waste Land</i> and "Dans le Restaurant") to
be similarly Semitic. They are not. The differences between them are
akin to the contrast that H. G. Wells

<b></b>

made in 1922&#8212;the Hebrews were a "little semitic people" while the
Phoenicians were "sea Semites," vigorous and inventive.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
(v) Schuchard says nothing at all about "A Cooking Egg" or "Sweeney Among
the Nightingales." He says nothing about <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i>, which
sets vulgar Jews against the visionary Sweeney. He says nothing about
the deployment of the lower case "j" in "Gerontion"'s, "Burbank"'s, and
"Dirge"'s jew&#8212;and so nothing too about the post-War switch to the
upper case. He offers no explanation for the revision to the footnote
in <i>Notes</i>. Whatever does not fit his thesis is ignored.

<p>
(vi) Near the beginning of his essay, Schuchard explains that he "feel[s]
obliged to address the widespread presumption that [Eliot's] writings
are anti-Semitic" , the implication being that this is an unexamined
prejudice, pervasive but unargued, and nothing more. That is, he writes
as if neither Christopher Ricks's <i>T.S. Eliot and Prejudice</i> nor my
own <i>T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism and Literary Form</i>, had been written.


<p>&nbsp;

<p>
I am taken aback by Schuchard's principal defence of Eliot, that is,
that some of his best friends were Jewish. I doubt whether even the least
sophisticated of contemporary anti-Semites would now think it possible
to get away with such a statement. But it satisfies Schuchard (who I am
sure is <i>not</i> an anti-Semite), perhaps because he is so excited
about the Kallen papers. He is too easily satisfied. He is persuaded,
for example, by Eliot's own denial of anti-Semitism, perhaps here because
he is just unaware of how common it is for anti-Semites to make similar,
bad faith denials.

<p>
Schuchard's essay itself is an example of a certain kind of response to
anti-Semitic events or texts. This response may be characterised as one of
"denial." The denial has four elements:

<p>
First, the refusal to acknowledge the self-evidently anti-Semitic nature
of an event or text.

<p>
Second, the deployment of demonstrably bad arguments (misreadings,
suppressions, the application of double standards in the assessment of
similar kinds of evidence, etc. etc.) in defence of the event or text.

<p>
Third, specifically in relation to texts or events that give offence,
the refusal to accept that those offended by those texts or events were
right to be offended.

<p>
Fourth, a tendency to find the "true" or "real" offence in the response
of those claiming to be offended or injured, a culpable error on their
part (for example: it was "unjust" of Jews such as George Boas to take
offence at <i>After Strange Gods</i>).

<p>
All four elements must be present to constitute a work of
"denial." Schuchard's is such a work. If nothing else, his essay
demonstrates that it is possible to <i>say</i>, or to <i>write</i>,
anything. It is possible to claim that the author of "Burbank" and
"Gerontion" was a philo-Semite, that the poems themselves express sympathy
with Jewish suffering, and that when in <i>After Strange Gods</i>
Eliot said "Jews" he didn't mean "Jews," just as when he said "race"
he didn't mean "race."

<p>
This freedom with the truth follows upon the poet's own freedom with
Jews. There is a similar disregard, amounting to disdain, demonstrated
by each of them. Poet is

<b></b>

followed by critic, the one attacking Jews, the other dismissing Jewish
complaints about being attacked. Critics who excuse Eliot's anti-Semitism,
or worse, pretend that it does not exist, merely carry on his own work
of contempt towards Jews.

A Response to Ronald Schuchard
<!--_/title-->
</h2>

<hr />
<!--_text-->


<p>
In what way, Ronald Schuchard's essay asks us to consider, does the
expression of a particular attitude in poetry resist the contextualization
of that attitude? To what degree might new evidence persuade us that
the line "the jew is underneath the lot" does or does not represent an
anti-Semitic point of view?

<p>
Thinking of the reception of "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with
a Cigar," the poem in which this line occurs, Eliot said, "here I am
considered by the ordinary Newspaper critic as a Wit or satirist, and in
America I suppose I shall be thought merely disgusting" . Eliot made
another version of this remark in a laudatory review of Edith Wharton's
<i>Summer</i>: the novel "should add to Mrs. Wharton's reputation as a
novelist the distinction of being the satirist's satirist," said Eliot,
but it would "certainly be considered 'disgusting' in America." Eliot
himself thought that <i>Summer</i> was a novel of "unrelieved horror,"
a quality that amply distinguishes "Burbank with a Baedeker" and other
poems of the period.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Eliot not only admired Wharton; he saw some of his own most treasured
 ideals reflected in her work.

<p>
Around the same time, Eliot also made statements expressing contempt for
women writers. Praising the Jewish poet Isaac Rosenberg, as Schuchard
reminds us, Eliot said that an audience ignorant of Rosenberg's
work must ask itself "why it has heard of the poems of Lady Precocia
Pondoeuf and has seen a photograph of the nursery in which she wrote
them" (23, n.22). This sentence is meaningful because it manipulates
a prejudice. Eliot does not simply ask us to consider why one poet is
more well-known than another; he also tells us why: the general public
prefers decorative poems by women to difficult, substantial poems by men.

<b></b>

<p>
As any reader of Eliot knows, one can easily find other sentences in
which Eliot expresses prejudices against women, homosexuals, Jews, or the
Irish. At the same time, one can just as easily find sentences in which
Eliot expresses the deepest admiration for particular writers who happen
to be female, homosexual, Jewish, or Irish. Schuchard wonders how Eliot
could have considered "Burbank with a Baedeker" an "intensely serious"
poem if its motive "was to exercise a little gratuitous anti-Semitism in
the face of his Jewish friends" . Missing from this argument, however,
is the possibility that the prejudice is not gratuitous but essential
to the poem, just as an anti-feminist prejudice is essential to Eliot's
praise of Isaac Rosenberg. Does evidence of Eliot's admiration for
Wharton or Rosenberg suggest that he could not have been anti-feminist
or anti-Semitic? Or does the variety of his statements suggest that
Eliot was conflicted, capable of admiration that did not necessarily
dismantle the structure of his prejudices?

<p>
Schuchard presents a wealth of new evidence that must alter our
sense of Eliot's long-documented prejudice against Jews, but the
relationship of that evidence to Eliot's poetry is difficult to
calibrate precisely. Thinking of these lines from "Burbank with a
Baedeker"&#8212;"The rats are underneath the piles./ The jew is underneath
the lot"&#8212;Schuchard suggests that they express Eliot's sense of "the
terrible irony that the new foundations of post-war Europe were being
laid on the corpses of Jews" . At issue in this reading of the poem,
however, is the fact that this bit of parallel syntax, conjoining the
fates of rats and Jews, is extremely provocative. No matter how it is
contextualized, no matter what new evidence arises, this syntax will
continue to be controversial, just as Eliot's comparison of the poems
of Isaac Rosenberg and Lady Precocia Pondoeuf will continue to seem
manipulative. For better and for worse, part of the power of "Burbank
with a Baedeker" inheres in the fact that it is a highly provocative poem,
a poem that asks us to feel provoked to judgment, just as Eliot's remark
about poetry by women asks us to feel provoked.

<p>
I feel certain that Eliot's admiration for Isaac Rosenberg was as sincere
as his admiration for Edith Wharton. But I also believe the Eliot who
said in 1933, the same year in which he delivered the lectures published
as <i>After Strange Gods</i>, that "the virtue of tolerance is greatly
overestimated, and I have no objection to being called a bigot myself."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 At times, Eliot's poems are powerful because their language invites
 us to call him a bigot.

<p>
How do we write a history of modern architecture that considers
gender? What would that history look like if we read it through its
photographic traces? Is it possible to derive from the case of one
photographer located outside the canons of architectural and photographic
history a broader lesson about gender and modernity? What if this story
were told from the perspective of Spanish modernity, a situation in the
story of modernism which itself undergoes continual revision?
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 In this essay, I would like to propose just such a project in order
 to chart a particular instance of a woman's place in the history of
 modern architecture.

<p>
Recently, feminist scholars have turned to women's roles as patrons and
designers of modern architecture.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 This has provided a new body of writing that addresses questions of
 agency, authorship, creativity, and methodology. Often, photographs
 of the women involved in these projects are juxtaposed with archival
 images of the buildings they helped to create. We imagine how the
 women moved in these spaces, what they looked like, and how they might
 have been perceived by the architects with whom they worked. Thus far,
 however, few have addressed the photographs as historical, biographical
 or artistic objects.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Who took them? How were they composed? What control, if any, might
 these women have had over their image? Fewer studies have asked the
 broader question: how were women involved in creating the "image" of
 modern architecture? It is this last question that I want to explore,
 not in isolation but in relation to depictions of women in architectural
 spaces. I will focus on the work of one female photographer, who took
 photographs of

<b></b>

modern architecture in Barcelona during the 1930s, to draw out larger
issues about mobility, anonymity, creativity, and exile. I hope to show
that it is through an investigation of these ideas that we might begin
to decipher the difficult, yet productive, place of women in modern
architecture.

<p>
Margaret Michaelis, born Margarethe Gross in Austria in 1902, was a
stranger in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Together with her husband, Rudolf Michaelis, she fled from Germany
 in 1933. (She and Rudolf separated shortly after their arrival in
 Barcelona, and this added to Michaelis's numerous labels: single
 working woman.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>) She was part of a community of exiles, who were politically active in
the Mediterranean city during the 1930s. Like many of them, she was an
Anarchist, like some of them, she was a Jew; neither identity was easy
to negotiate in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Despite this, she was able to publish her photographs over the course
 of almost five years in the city's most modern magazines. One might
 even argue that it was largely Michaelis who supplied Barcelona with
 its modern photographic identity. Perhaps it was her "strangeness"
 which afforded her the ability to create images that were read as
 modern at the time they were published, and into the present.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Michaelis was trained in Vienna, worked with leading photographers there
 and in Berlin, was well-versed in the style of the "New Photography,"
 and brought all of this foreignness to bear on the buildings that she
 saw in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 It is probably because of their relation to international modernism,
 vis-&agrave;-vis Germany, that Michaelis's photographs have been
 used so often in catalogues and surveys about architecture in early
 twentieth-century Spain. They have become a kind of photographic
 shorthand to demonstrate the existence of a strident, forward-looking
 architectural avant-garde that coincided with the brief reforms of
 the Second Republic government.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
The identification of Michaelis's photographs with Spanish modernity
was assisted by the fact that the greatest number of them appeared
in <i>A.C. Documentos de Actividad Contempor&aacute;nea</i>
(<i>A.C. Documents of Contemporary Activity</i>), which was the
publication of the leading, reformist architectural group in Spain,
G.A.T.E.P.A.C. (Grupo de Arquitectos y T&eacute;cnicos Espa&ntilde;oles
para el Progreso de la Arquitectura Contempor&aacute;nea / Group of
Spanish Architects and Technicians for the Progress of Contemporary
Architecture).
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 The magazine quickly became most closely associated with the
 Catalan faction of this group, G.A.T.C.P.A.C. (Grup d'Arquitectes
 i T&egrave;cnics Catalans per al Progr&eacute;s de l'Arquitectura
 Contempor&agrave;nia / Group of Catalan Architects and Technicians
 for the Progress of Contemporary Architecture). From about 1934
 onwards, Michaelis's photographs dominate the magazine's visual
 content. However, neither at the time nor until recently were
 they attributed to her, since almost all of the material in that
 magazine was published anonymously in accordance with the group's
 belief in collective authorship. The architects of the buildings
 that Michaelis photographed&#8212;Josep Lluis Sert, Josep Torres
 Clav&eacute;, G. Rodr&iacute;guez Arias, and R. Ribas Seva&#8212;were
 knowledgeable about the modern movement in architecture, participated
 in international meetings and exhibitions, and were among Barcelona's
 select group of progressive, financially secure, and highly educated
 artists and intellectuals. It was within this circle of the city's
 elite architects that Michaelis found her most loyal clientele.

<b></b>

<p>
Previously, historians have read her photographs as transparent signs of
the achievements of these male architects. If they have been considered
as gendered at all, it would have been as decidedly male, reflecting the
architect's designs and intentions. Now that we know that Michaelis was
the author of many of the most famous photographs of their buildings,
the question of gender becomes something of a puzzle. In relation to
these issues, but before entering into a discussion of Michaelis's work,
I want to briefly examine the photographs of modern architecture which
included women, that were taken by Catalan photographer Josep Sala before
her arrival on the scene. Comparing Michaelis's photographs with those
of the only other photographer whose services were repeatedly contracted
by the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. during the same period may provide a base for
interpreting gender in Michaelis's work.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

1 Signs of Modernity?:<br />
Women and Architecture
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Josep Sala was one of a handful of successful commercial photographers
in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 His work was published widely and he gained a reputation as
 an accomplished publicity photographer, whose modern style images
 appeared throughout the 1930s in the city's magazines. In 1932 he became
 artistic director of Barcelona's well established illustrated magazine,
 <i>D'Ac&iacute; i d'All&agrave;</i> (<i>From Here and from There</i>),
 and helped to initiate the magazine's new look, which featured a metal
 spiral binding, larger format, and the dynamic use of photography
 and typography.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Sala was commissioned by Barcelona's top companies to produce ads which
 ran in all of the city's major publications. He became a household name
 among the city's elite and its mass consumers. His work is directly
 relevant to Michaelis's in that her own work appeared a few years later
 in both <i>D'Ac&iacute; i d'All&agrave;</i> and, during the Civil War,
 in another magazine that Sala helped to direct, <i>Nova Iberia</i>
 (<i>New Iberia</i>), published by the Catalan government's Comissariat
 de Propaganda.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Before he became artistic director for <i>D'Ac&iacute; i
d'All&agrave;</i>, Sala was commissioned by G.A.T.C.P.A.C. architects
like Josep Lluis Sert to take photographs of their newly constructed
buildings. These photographs were published in <i>A.C.</i> and in other
articles and books edited by the group in Spain.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Among the most relevant for my discussion are two series of photographs
 that Sala took in the early 1930s of Sert's 1929 residential
 apartment building on Muntaner Street and the store opened by the
 G.A.T.C.P.A.C. on Barcelona's upper-class Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia. Of
 the photographs that he took of these buildings, several feature modern,
 fashionably dressed women. The women are located both outside and
 within the spaces as if they were props. They are staged to become
 signs of modernity, like the architecture itself. This use of the
 female re to signal, through her presence, a state of novelty and
 sophistication, is radically different from Michaelis's framing of women
 as active participants in the creation of a scene. Michaelis's women
 create an axis within the visual space from which the composition is
 ordered. Even when women are absent from the scene, as is the case in
 some of her photographs, she makes evident their potential design or
 use of the space. In Sala's photographs, instead, the women could be
 removed from the scene without any disturbance or impact upon it. They
 occupy the space, but do not transform it.

<b></b>

<p>
Two photographs of Sert's residential building on Muntaner Street, taken
by Sala around 1930-31, will serve as an example. In one of them, Sala
has organized his horizontally composed photograph around the modern
furnishings in the interior of the living space. (<a name="1"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#1"> 1</a>) The woman is
located at the far end, about to ascend the staircase. The scale of the
architecture and furnishings dwarf her; she is framed by the darker toned
door behind her. Everything in the image has been carefully arranged
beforehand. A cactus is placed on a round modern table at the lower
center of the room. Two architectural magazines are opened on the other
side. The information in the magazines is, in fact, more legible than
the individual characteristics of the woman. We see the modern line of
her dress, her neatly cropped hair, the graceful, but firm, gesture of
her hand on the railing, but we do not see her in detail.

<p>
In a second photograph of the same space, the woman is once
again framed by the architecture in a diminutive way, this
time through the use of a vertical composition. (<a name="2"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#2"> 2</a>) She now sits in
one of the modern chairs reading an architectural magazine from the
table. Hanging from the ceiling is a large globe lamp, which out-measures
the female model in size and visual importance. Like the cactus plants
and African sculpture arranged along the window sill, she is merely
another element of modernity to inhabit Sert's streamlined residency.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 As Sala depicts her in the two photographs, she has no agency of her
 own. She does, however, actively engage in reading modern architectural
 magazines. Is she, then, the audience that the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. is
 addressing? Is she the consumer, or perhaps the client, who will
 call upon the group's services after glancing through the pages of
 <i>A.C.</i>, or a similar, internationally minded publication? Or is
 she the modern woman who the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s male readers imagine
 inhabiting their own spaces? In any of these possible scenarios,
 Sala establishes a relationship between women and readership that he
 carries over into his photographs of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s showroom.

<p>
As with his photographs of the Muntaner Street residency, his
publicity shots of the showroom may be read as a sequence, though it
is less clear how the photographs relate to each other, especially
in terms of the space represented. The one continuous element in
both photographs is once again a fashionably dressed woman who is
carefully located in the composition. In the first photograph,
Sala positions the woman outside the showroom. (<a name="3"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#3"> 3</a>) With her hand placed
on the glass pane, she looks into the space from the street. Her eyes
rest upon a number of <i>A.C.</i> that has been opened on the glass table
inside. Like the first group of photographs, Sala intentionally organizes
the interior of the architectural space. Accompanying the opened magazines
on the center glass table is a single, closed issue of the first number of
<i>A.C.</i> . The woman's pose leads the reader to the magazines,
making the photograph an advertisement not only for the showroom and its
furnishings, but also for the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s publications. She becomes
the agent through which consumption is advertised as a progressive,
reformist gesture.

<p>
In the second photograph of the series, the same
woman is seated inside the showroom. (<a name="4"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#4"> 4</a>) She reads an issue
of the first number of <i>A.C.</i>; numerous copies of the same magazine
are spread out upon a modern chrome table. Along the window sill are

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 146]</b>

several cacti. She does not look at the reader. In fact, in none of
Sala's photographs does the woman direct herself to the photograph's
viewer. Instead, she is absorbed in either the act of viewing the
architectural space or its representation in the magazines. The female
re in Sala's photographs becomes a nexus point for architecture and
publicity; she brings both together compositionally and conceptually.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

2 Michaelis's Photographs of Architecture
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
It would be tempting to metaphorically place Michaelis in the position
of Sala's women. In many ways, she cemented the relationship between
women, architecture, and publicity during the time that she worked
professionally in Barcelona. Her first photo studio was even set up
in one of Sert's residential buildings on Rosell&oacute; Street; the
building was constructed in the same year and not very different from
the one on Muntaner Street.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 But Michaelis's photographs of modern architecture <i>were</i>
 different from Sala's, though both were stylistically marked by the "New
 Photography." In Michaelis's photographs of architecture, surprisingly
 few women are represented. When women <i>do</i> appear, they are
 not merely compositional elements as in Sala's photographs. They
 inhabit the space in a manner that makes them the focal point of the
 composition, often directly addressing the viewer in their pose. With
 this, Michaelis demonstrates that she identifies with the women who
 occupy the architectural environments that she photographs.

<b></b>

<p>
Consider Michaelis's photographs of Sert's week-end house in the coastal
town of Garraf. Sert designed the house with his G.A.T.C.P.A.C. colleague
Josep Torres Clav&eacute;. It was built in 1935, and photographs of it
appeared in the city's major magazines. In one of Michaelis's most widely
reproduced photographs of the Garraf house, she employed a horizontal
format with a strong diagonal emphasis.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 (<a name="5" href="10.1mendelson_res.html#5"> 5</a>) The
 interior occupies the majority of the composition, with the furniture
 creating lively angles within the space. A clear line through the
 interior leads the viewer's eye out to the brighter, lighter tones
 of the exterior patio. There sits a woman, casually posed with her
 legs crossed sitting in a modern chair. Unlike the women in Sala's
 photographs, she looks directly across the architectural space and
 confronts the viewer with her presence. Hers is not a passive pose. She
 is not reading nor is she placed as a transient element. Instead, she
 seems to claim her place within the composition (and the architectural
 space). Michaelis reinforces this, as the diagonal created with the
 placement of the furniture finds its apex with the female seated
 re. The woman in Michaelis's photograph has been identified as
 Sert's wife, Moncha (<i>MMFVP</i>, 90). This being the case, we have
 an instance where the architect's wife and the woman commissioned
 to photograph

<b></b>

the house face one another. It is their gaze that fills the space between
the exterior patio and Michaelis's camera located within the house. In
other words, they activate the space with their capacity to create,
or at least occupy, a view of modern architecture.

<p>
Of course, there are competing interpretations of this
photograph. Michaelis was an outsider and, being that she was a working
woman separated from her husband, she may have been considered a threat
to the bourgeois propriety that even the most progressive of Catalan
intellectuals sought to maintain. The exchange between Michaelis and
Sert's wife might have been riddled with issues of gender, class,
and nationality. Moncha's position is ambiguous, in that while she is
a dominant element in the composition, she is located outside of the
house itself, close to nature, and the abundance of sunlight threatens
to encroach upon the clarity of her facial features and the outline of
her re.

<p>
Theorists have argued that women have often been located in the liminal,
transitional spaces between outside and inside.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Sometimes seen as a limiting function of patriarchy's construction of
 public and private space, the use of liminality by women has recently
 been opened to a multiplicity of interpretations. The margins might
 be seen not only as a reinforcement of hegemonic notions of status
 and position, but also as a potential site to challenge normative
 relations. In the case of this image, it may also coincide with a
 particular socially constructed condition that was shared by both

<b></b>

Moncha Sert and Michaelis as women in 1930s Spain.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 If interpreted as a challenge to patriarchal conrations of
 architecture and space, the photograph documents an occasion when both
 women collaborated in producing an image of modern architecture that
 was at once overseen by the architects of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. and a
 challenge to their authority.

<p>
Michaelis's relationship to her female subjects must have been
complex. But, for all of the questions that we may have about her
biography or the specific circumstances of her commissions, there is
no archival material left about these issues by her Catalan clients or
Michaelis herself.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 We must rely almost exclusively on the photographs published at the time
 or those conserved in archives for potential answers. The published
 photographs form a record of Michaelis's activities in Barcelona;
 they also document the editorial decisions made by her publishers. As
 far as we know, Michaelis did not exercise control over the final
 selection of photographs nor over how her images appeared in print.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Offering a wider view of Michaelis's work are the archival and
 photographic materials conserved principally in three collections: the
 National Gallery of Australia (Canberra), the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric
 of the Col.legi d'Arquitectes de Catalunya (Barcelona), and the
 Arxiu Fotogr&agrave;fic of the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric de la Ciutat
 (Barcelona). The National Gallery houses the Michaelis-Sachs Archive,
 composed of photographs that Michaelis bequeathed to the Gallery.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 In the museum setting of the National Gallery, it is the identity of
 Michaelis as artist that determines the organization of the images:
 subjects are identified as much as possible, but primary importance is
 given to the photographs as works of art and the group as indicative
 of an individual author's oeuvre. Until recently, so little was known
 of her work in Spain that many of the photographs which appeared
 in Barcelona's leading magazines went unidentified. This is very
 different from the two groups of photographs conserved in Barcelona's
 collections. These archives give primacy to subject matter and locate
 Michaelis's photographs within a body of material related to the
 G.A.T.C.P.A.C. In the Col.legi d'Arquitectes, they are classified
 within several sub-sections of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. archive, usually by
 project or building, but also within a separate photographic archive.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Until a few years ago, the photographs held by the Arxiu
 Fotogr&agrave;fic of the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric de la Ciutat were
 unavailable for consultation.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 They are now undergoing classification. If they are integrated into the
 archive and follow its existing system, they will probably either be
 classified by location and date, or will be maintained as a separate
 collection related to the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. In either case, Michaelis's
 authorship of the photographs probably will not be the primary mode
 of classification.

<p>
When organizing the first exhibition of Michaelis's work in Spain, we
established her authorship of unsigned photographs in the Barcelona
archives by comparing them to the photographs attributed to her in
the National Gallery. Often, it was through the use of her published
photographs that series of related images were brought back together. The
series were complete in only a few instances in any of the three
archives. An exception to this are the photographs that Michaelis took of
R. Ribas Seva's Torre Eugenia. In 1936 <i>D'Ac&iacute; i d'All&agrave;</i>
published a three-page article, illustrated by Michaelis, devoted to
the building, with a small reference at the bottom of the third page to

<b></b>

"Foto Elis."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 The majority of the photographs are exterior shots, which emphasize
 the building's clean geometric forms and symmetrical lines. (<A
 NAME="6" href="10.1mendelson_res.html#6"> 6</a>)
 One of the few photographs of the interior features a small gym off
 the patio. With its emphasis on clarity, cleanliness, sunlight, and
 physical activity, Michaelis's photographs make of the Torre Eugenia
 a symbol of modernity. There are few vestiges of the past included
 in the published photographs. Similarly, aside from the photographs
 of the gym and the pool, both of which refer to leisure activities,
 there are few elements of domesticity, either in the decoration or as
 part of the everyday use of the architectural space.

<p>
This contrasts with the fuller range of photographs that Michaelis
took of the Torre Eugenia, which are conserved in the Col.legi
d'Arquitectes. In addition to those published in <i>D'Ac&iacute; i
d'All&agrave;</i>, there are photographs of the living room, which is
adorned with memorabilia of bull ts. The furniture in the living room
is decorative, with several elements bearing likeness to art deco rather
than international style. While these photographs speak more to the
heterogeneous nature of modernism in Spain, with its mix of tradition
and modernity, Michaelis also took photographs of the efficiently
designed kitchen and luxuriously equipped bathroom. (<a name="7"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#7"> 7</a>) Neither of these
were featured in the magazine's article, yet they are images that align
Michaelis's interests with the most advanced domestic planning, namely
Margarete Sch&uuml;tte-Lihotsky's innovative kitchen designs for Ernst
May's housing complexes in Frankfurt.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Why would images that articulate a specific aspect of modern
 architecture not be included in the magazine's three-page article? Why
 were the leisure spaces featured above the advances in hygiene and
 efficient domestic management? Part of the answer may lie with the
 magazine's readership.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 As an illustrated magazine, filled with articles on film, fashion,
 art, and tourism, its readers may not have been interested in the
 "behind the scenes" innovations of the Torre Eugenia.

<p>
In choosing the photographs as they did, the magazine's editors, which
included Sala, also removed the spaces that were more closely related
to women's work in the home.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Technical magazines like <i>A.C.</i> did include articles on modern
 innovations in hygiene.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 But, when they focused squarely on the spaces of domesticity, like the
 kitchen, the majority of the photographs documented the unsanitary
 conditions of the tenement buildings of Barcelona's Fifth District,
 popularly called the <i>Barrio Chino</i> (China Town) because of its
 portside location and vices.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 It is in Michaelis's photographs of these buildings that we see her
 searching for those markers within the architectural space that signal
 women's presence. Many of these were edited out of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s
 publications. In comparing those that were included in <i>A.C.</i> with
 those that are conserved in Australia and Barcelona, we may begin to
 reconstruct Michaelis's complex view of women's place in architecture.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
3 Women at Work:<br />
The Other Side of Modernity
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
As part of their urban plan for Barcelona, the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. architects,
with the collaboration of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, proposed the
"Pla Maci&aacute;" to the city government.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Although it was never carried out, the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. published numerous

<b></b>

articles and held several exhibitions featuring its major components
during the 1930s. Margaret Michaelis was the main photographer
commissioned to take photographs of the Fifth District, which was the
focus of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s reformist gestures.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 It was the city's most notorious center of poverty, prostitution,
 drugs, and crime. The photographs by Michaelis that appeared in print
 showed architectural features of the cramped tenement buildings and
 children from the neighborhood. There were also some photographs of
 the district's "typical" inhabitants, which included women either
 leaning out of their windows or posed in doorways.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The signage above one woman&#8212;<i>Habitaciones</i> or
 rooms&#8212;makes an oblique reference to the women's reputation as
 prostitutes. For the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. photographs, Michaelis's lens was
 trained on the tight alleyways, the garbage-filled passages, and the
 dirty interiors and exteriors that characterized housing in the Fifth
 District. All of these images gave the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. the evidence
 they needed to demonstrate the logic and urgency of their proposed
 urban reforms, which included demolishing the old housing in favor of
 modern style apartment blocks and open public spaces.

<p>
Of a more ambiguous nature are the photographs of domestic interiors and
of women in public spaces that were <i>not</i> published or exhibited
by the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. Most of these photographs are conserved either in
the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric de la Ciutat or the National

<b></b>

Gallery, and they form two distinct groups. The first series, conserved in
the city's archive, centers around domestic interiors, probably taken in
the Fifth District. The second series was most likely taken at a slightly
later date. This series has a different, more playful tone. They feature
men and women in Barcelona's caf&eacute;s and stores, openly pursuing
their daily activities. To my knowledge, neither group of photographs
appeared in print during the 1930s. In all of the photographs, Michaelis
addresses more directly than in her other work the role of women in
Barcelona's society. She focuses less on the architecture itself and more
on how the women inhabit or activate the space around them. In terming
these photographs the "other side of modernity," I wish to address their
fundamental role in illustrating the daily work (and pleasures) of the
city's female inhabitants, a side of modernity that did not appear in
the published photographs of the city's modern architecture. While the
G.A.T.C.P.A.C. wished to demolish the Fifth District as anti-modern,
because of the dirt, disease, and drugs associated with it, Michaelis's
photographs vindicate the practices, routines, and gestures of its female
laboring class as an undeniable and constitutive part of Barcelona's
modern experience. As Michaelis shows her viewer, the disavowed spaces
of modernity are filled with the stories of her female subjects.

<p>
The first series of photographs documents the inside of a tenement
apartment. Michaelis offers us straight photographs of the tight
quarters. Two beds and an alcove are the elements that she examines, but
she also offers us a picture of the struggles of 

<b></b>

women doing piecework
for a living. Michaelis could have chosen to highlight the negative
aspects of the scene; instead, she turns each element into an integral
part of the composition. In one photograph, two beds are framed to show
their symmetry. A cross hangs between them and the area is orderly. In
another, Michaelis shows us the bottom edge of one of the beds. We
see a piece of fabric hanging from the left side of the wall and a
single boot under the bed. She captures the light on the covers, which
emphasizes the care that she has taken in composing the photograph. The
most compelling of the series is a split-frame horizontal image that
features one of the beds on the left side and, on the other side of the
door frame, two women working in a darkened alcove. (<a name="8"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#8"> 8</a>) Only one of the women
is fully visible in the photograph. An outlined shadow and the slight hang
of a dress over a chair hidden behind the wall are the only indicators
of the second woman's presence. The woman in full view is wearing a
light-toned, smartly styled dress. Michaelis shows her to be a poised,
self possessed subject, who is strained in deep concentration. While
she does not look up at the viewer, all of our attention is focused on
her. As she had done with her photograph of the Garraf house, Michaelis
has worked the composition around her female subject. She uses the formal
qualities of the photograph to counter stereotypes about the living
quarters and inhabitants of the neighborhood, many of which formed
the core of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s proposals. It is through Michaelis's
unpublished photographs that we learn of her interaction with Barcelona's
working women. As a single woman working to earn her own living in a
strange city, Michaelis must have sympathized with the plight of her
subjects. Like them, she had to negotiate her way through the city.

<p>
Michaelis's first experience in Barcelona was most likely in the Fifth
District, where she stayed during a brief visit to the city prior to
moving their with Rudolf in 1933. The evidence of her trip is an unsigned
typescript conserved in the Col.legi d'Arquitectes and the photographs
of the neighborhood that were published in <i>A.C.</i> in 1932.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 In the typescript, which is written in German and makes only a
 single reference to the author's gender ("they hung onto my skirt"),
 Michaelis writes of her passage through the city's dark alleyways and
 her confrontation with its most picturesque and dangerous characters.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Her camera at once gives her mobility and restricts her actions. In
 the midst of taking photographs, she is threatened by the local tough
 men. They chase her through the alleys as she ducks knowingly into the
 hostel where most of the foreigners stay. Just outside the hostel,
 she photographs a group of children being entertained by a street
 musician. She voices familiar knowledge of local customs and the
 manners that ensure safe passage through the District's most dangerous
 situations. As she moves among the city's marginal inhabitants and
 documents the scenes that she would later write about, Michaelis
 experiences a sense of exhilaration. Despite the publication of the
 photographs that she took during her "brief raid into the <i>Barrio
 Chino</i>," her text remained unpublished.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 One wonders whether Michaelis's reluctance to emphasize her gender or
 identity in the text is an outcome of her broader belief in the very
 modern, political gesture of anonymity. As one of the city's countless
 anonymous subjects, Michaelis perhaps believed she was in a position
 of empowerment.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Traveling through the city's streets with her camera, she straddled
 the fence between Barcelona's marginal zones and its modern ambitions.

<b></b>

<p>
Where her relationship with the city's female subjects comes
through most unexpectedly is in the second series of photographs
taken at a slightly later date, which are conserved in the National
Gallery. Here Michaelis documents a social and photographic pact with
her subjects. Knowing gestures and relaxed smiles characterize the
women in these photographs. In one group, Michaelis photographs women
in a bread shop. By their dress and the store's decor, this image may
have been taken in the middle- class <i>Eixample</i> area instead
of the Fifth District. The women's hair has been carefully styled
and they stand with confidence, making their daily purchases. In one
photograph, the bakery attendant comfortably pats her customer's shoulder
while they stand arm in arm in front of the store. (<a name="9"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#9"> 9</a>) The female customer,
who has been identified as "June" in the National Gallery records,
directly addresses the camera (and Michaelis); neither Michaelis nor her
subject flinch away from the act of documenting women's daily routines.

<p>
In these photographs, Michaelis introduces a higher level of theatricality
into her compositions. She engages her subjects as actors in creating
a narrative around their actions within the city's architectural
spaces. This directed use of the camera to include within the frame
an active collaboration with her subjects had already been present in
her earlier photographs, both of the Garraf house and the District's
tenements: but now it becomes more dominant. No longer a documentarian
"on the run" through the streets of Barcelona, Michaelis demonstrates
entitlement over her subjects

<b></b>

and her own place within the city's places of commerce and entertainment
in these photographs. Take, for example, her photograph of a woman with
two men in the Taverna dels Tenors, one of the popular music bars in
the Fifth District.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 (<a name="0" href="10.1mendelson_res.html#0"> 10</a>)
 The Taverna was frequented by local celebrities and members of
 Barcelona's aristocracy, but in her photograph Michaelis plays on the
 criminal expectations that the <i>Barrio Chino</i> held for most of
 the city's inhabitants. A woman distracted in conversation with the
 man to her right does not notice a second man who grabs her purse. He
 looks over to her with a sidelong expression, as his cap shadows his
 face. He holds his suit jacket closed with one hand and a cigar hangs
 from the side of his mouth. As Michaelis pictures the scene, it is a
 caricature of the roles that men and women played in public spaces. She
 demonstrates her knowledge of how conventions are manipulated and how
 women's place in public spaces forms part of an elaborate narrative
 about sexuality, entertainment, crime, and spectatorship. In the other
 photographs of the Taverna we see how comfortably Michaelis was able
 to move through the space. Her mid-range photographs are carefully
 composed, with the audience members, employees, and entertainers all
 taking part in the images that she captured.

<p>
Michaelis's photographs of the city's modern architecture and its Fifth
District were only one aspect of her career in Barcelona. She also took
photographs of popular festivals, gypsies, political actions, and social
services. In addition, her work was not limited to straight photographs of
a documentary or commercial nature. She also pursued work in advertising
and in portraiture. As observed by Karl Brauner, who sometimes

<b></b>

assisted Michaelis in her studio, she had very little time for anything
but work.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 It may be because of her tremendous output and its diverse nature that
 Michaelis never created a single identifiable style, instead developing
 a market for the many aspects of her photographic work. Her strategy
 for surviving, as a photographer and a single woman in Barcelona,
 therefore contrasted radically with the characterization of the modern
 architectural photographer put forward by Cervin Robinson and Joel
 Herschman in their <i>Architecture Transformed: A History of the
 Photography of Buildings from 1839 to the Present</i>:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The task of an ambitious architectural photographer at the beginning of
the 1930s was much what it had always been and continues to be to our
day: to produce a print of sufficient physical quality that one's work is
taken seriously, to get ahead of the pack of one's fellow photographers
by some aesthetic act, and to remain inthe public eye thereafter with
a recognizable, individual style.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
All of the characteristics that we might attribute to Michaelis's work
counter this limiting definition. Michaelis did not remain in the public
eye, at least not in Barcelona, and her work changed visibly depending
upon her environment. Much of her work was reproduced in magazines,
where the "physical quality" of a single print mattered less than its
mass distribution. Similarly, she did not "get ahead of the pack" in
Barcelona. Instead, one might argue, she was able to capitalize upon a
taste for modern images

<b></b>

that was, at least in part, introduced by some of her colleagues,
especially Josep Sala.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 No doubt, she provided her clients with photographs of proven quality
 that, at the same time, were affordable and accessible. Where she
 differed from the rest of the photographers in Barcelona was in her
 training, her focus on women's and worker's issues, and her political
 and intellectual affinities. It was, perhaps, this last aspect of
 her life and work that might explain what appears to be a deliberate
 emphasis on anonymity as a form of photographic and political activism.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
4 Anonymity as a Productive Strategy
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
What if anonymity was a conscious, strategic choice made by Michaelis? She
did not sign many of her photographs, and she participated in collective
endeavors that down-played individual authorship. Though her decision
may have been informed by economic and political considerations and/or a
sensitivity to the sexual politics of her profession (hence, the adoption
of the gender-neutral professional name "Foto-Elis"), I would like to
explore an historically specific, intellectual context for her practice.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 In making the critical and creative gesture to encourage the reception
 of her work as anonymous documents, Michaelis made a radically modern
 decision, one that she shared with the leading artists and theoreticians
 of her age.

<p>
During the 1920s and 1930s, the condition of anonymity and how that
condition related to memory and modernity was central to international
debates on photography. In some form or another during this time,
in Austria, Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, and Spain (all places
where Michaelis trained and worked), the document defined modernity in
photographic and filmic production. As such, it is of little surprise
that Michaelis should engage directly with the document's stylistic
characteristics, especially in her early photographs of the Fifth
District, and its wider theoretical and political implications. Among
the most eloquent of the German writers to articulate the conditions of
the document were Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin. In addition
to Kracauer and Benjamin, both of whom Michaelis could have read while
living in Berlin from 1928 to 1933, the work of some of Michaelis's most
famous employers and colleagues directly informed these debates.

<p>
In 1927, Kracauer explored the relation between camera-reality and
historical-reality through a discussion of the difference between
photography and memory.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 In response to a series of reflections upon documentary images
 published in the illustrated press, Kracauer came to the conclusion that
 photography and memory were at odds with each other. Whereas memory
 was constructed through personally significant fragments, oftentimes
 full of gaps, mistakes, and false records, photography retained
 everything. Photography's ability to record, to document spatial and
 temporal continuums, conversely provided little in terms of identifying
 personal or social values. For Kracauer, the "photographic face" that
 the world took on with the advent of the illustrated press decreased
 an individual's or an object's natural connection to the world.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 Magazines, which Kracauer categorized as photographic archives,
 represented a warehouse of nature alienated from meaning. The world
 in fragments and the proliferation

<b></b>

of photographic documents represented nothing more than confusion. In
other words, the condition of photography itself encouraged the
anonymous, alienated experience of modernity.

<p>
Walter Benjamin countered Kracauer's critique of the negative effect
of photography on individual and social memory with an embrace of the
political potential that documentary photographs held for the masses. In
both "A Short History of Photography" of 1931 and "The Work of Art
in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" of 1936, Benjamin celebrated
photography's ability to absolve art of its cult value.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 Instead of the qualities of presence, genius, authenticity, and
 authorship that had been secured for individually created works of art,
 Benjamin upheld the value of non-auratic, democratically distributed
 mechanical reproduction. Moreover, the kinds of photographs that
 Benjamin exalted were precisely those that defined modern art and
 politics. Anonymous photographs shot with experimental viewpoints
 and published in illustrated magazines were the primary material
 from which Benjamin developed his theories on photography's political
 function. Most significant for Benjamin was photography's exhibition
 value, its place within the public sphere. It was photography's release
 from the constraints of memory and individual values that allowed it to
 have an impact on the masses; anyone could be a producer and consumer
 of photographic documents.

<p>
In relation to Michaelis's own photographic practice, Benjamin's writings
elucidate three fundamental aspects of her work in relation to the
issue of anonymity: her exposure to and participation in photographic
exhibitions and publications, her professional training, and her
commitment to photographing architecture.

<p>
In the years just prior to Benjamin's theorization of exhibition value,
Germany, along with the rest of Europe, experienced a photographic
explosion in the realms of artistic and everyday life. From 1922 to 1930,
Germany held more photographic exhibitions than any other country.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
 The most influential of these was the 1929 "Film und Foto" exhibition
 held in Stuttgart. Defining the primary stylistic characteristics of
 modern photography were the diversity of photographic categories and
 the embrace of formal experimentation. "Film und Foto" drew upon the
 work of both acknowledged masters and amateurs. Most notable among
 them was L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, who had only recently made
 the public move from the category of amateur to master.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 With his classes at the Bauhaus art school, writings on photography,
 and organizational role in photographic exhibitions like "Film und
 Foto," Moholy-Nagy influenced students, colleagues, and the public in
 Germany and abroad.

<p>
The two most important books to define the new photography in Germany
were Moholy-Nagy's <i>Painting Photography Film</i> of 1925 and Werner
Gr&auml;ff's <i>Here comes the new photographer!</i> of 1929.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 Both insisted upon the need to break with the conventional rules of
 representation. For Moholy-Nagy, as for Gr&auml;ff, scientific and
 documentary photographs were among the leading areas in experimentation;
 the close-up, unusual view points, radical cropping, and x-ray were
 among the techniques that had first served the utilitarian functions
 of non-artistic photography. According to Moholy-Nagy, photography
 offered a new way of seeing with "entirely different eyes."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 In support of their attempt to popularize this new program for
 photography, progressive

<b></b>

artists in Germany and elsewhere made photography the guiding element
in their books and magazines. What had initially given the avant-garde
its impulse to embrace photography&#8212;the illustrated press&#8212;now
guided the manufacture of a new vision for the avant-garde.

<p>
Magazines like <i>Das Neue Frankfurt</i> in Germany and <i>i10</i>
in the Netherlands, fused an embrace of photo reportage, which was the
most modern of the new photographic categories, with an active leftist
political agenda.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 Photography endowed these magazines with an identifiably modern
 appearance and a revision of earlier assumptions about the conration
 of reality. As Benjamin, who contributed to <i>i10</i>, expressed in
 concert with Moholy-Nagy's writings: "The enlargement of a snapshot
 does not simply render more precise what in any case was visible, though
 unclear: it reveals entirely new structural formations of the subject"
 ("TWOA," 236).

<p>
Michaelis was a student of and a participant in the formation of
1920s and 1930s central European photographic culture. She practiced
in Vienna, Prague, and Berlin, all of which were cities that encouraged
the documentary mode of photography as one of the most avant-garde. Even
more important to the issue of anonymity were the female photographers
who were her mentors and colleagues. The quantity of women photographers
practicing in Germany during the Weimar Republic was significant.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 Most of the individuals undertaking the labor of providing photographic
 documents for the press and for exhibitions were Jewish women in central
 Europe, some of whom were Michaelis's employers. Her first job was as
 an assistant for Dora Kallmus, who opened the Atelier d'Ora in Vienna
 in 1907. D'Ora's fashion photographs were so popular that by 1925 she
 opened another studio in Paris.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
 In a later job in Berlin, Michaelis was initiated into portraiture
 under the guidance of Suse Byk. Byk's photographs of intellectuals and
 celebrities appeared widely in books and magazines of the period. Like
 D'Ora, Byk sustained her photographic practice for over twenty years.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 Although Michaelis's experience with these successful photographers
 expanded her knowledge of a diversity of techniques and further oriented
 her to the photographic culture of Weimar Germany, she would really
 only fully exploit portraiture when she re-established herself in
 Australia after fleeing Europe in 1939.

<p>
For her work in Spain, Michaelis was most likely influenced by two other
women photographers. Both Lucia Moholy, who created some of the most
memorable documents of the Bauhaus school's architecture, products,
and lifestyle, and Germaine Krull, who photographed the high and low
of urban existence (the Eiffel Tower and the streets of Marseilles),
had exhibited in Germany's photography exhibitions.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Though their direct influence on Michaelis remains undocumented, they
 were both widely published pioneers in the field of architectural
 photography.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 Michaelis's photographs of G.A.T.C.P.A.C. architecture, her
 documentation of the <i>Barrio Chino</i>, and her own photographs of
 Marseilles were certainly influenced by the concurrent activities of
 both women. Lucia Moholy had set a precedent with her photographs of
 and for the Bauhaus for Michaelis's own role as the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s
 most important documentarian. The connection between the two women
 is even greater than formal affinities. Just about one month before
 Michaelis moved to Barcelona, Lucia Moholy had written

<b></b>

to Josep Lluis Sert in search of employment as the group's new
photographer.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 While no response to the letter is archived with the
 G.A.T.C.P.A.C. materials and there is no evidence that Moholy ever
 photographed for the group, it may be that her inquiry sparked Sert
 and others to consider Michaelis's potential more seriously. After
 all, by enlisting Michaelis's services they were able to custom order
 affordable modern images of their buildings that could be used in
 both their illustrated publications and exhibitions. With Michaelis's
 pedigree from the photographic studios of Vienna and Berlin, she
 offered the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. a direct link to Europe's most advanced
 photographic work. In addition, she complied with the magazine's
 emphasis on collective authorship, allowing the group to publish her
 photographs without her studio name.

<p>
For Michaelis, the political significance of photographing architecture
would have been equally important to having role models. In Berlin
and Prague, modern architecture and photography were coterminous
developments. Benjamin's remarks in the "Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction" are instructive. He argued that architecture,
like photography, was consumed by the collective "in a state of
distraction" ("TWOA," 259). In other words, as opposed to works which
called attention to themselves, architecture encouraged a "tactile
appropriation" based on habit ("TWOA," 240). Anonymity combined
with the democratic effect of exhibition value, forged a greater
connection between the image and the masses than individual works of
art. Ironically, while Michaelis's identity may have been unknown,
her anonymous photographs contributed to the political formation of
Barcelona's collective culture. As habitual images, ones which were
reproduced in some of the city's most aesthetically progressive magazines
(<i>D'Ac&iacute; i D'All&agrave;</i> and <i>A.C.</i>) and featured in
the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s didactic exhibitions of the mid-1930s (<i>Nova
Barcelona</i> and <i>Barcelona Futura</i>), Michaelis's photographs,
which de-emphasized authorship, had conversely achieved wide recognition.

<p>
Michaelis and the architects, advertisers, and publications she
worked for in Barcelona held a shared education in photography and
modernity that had its roots in German (and French) developments of the
1920s. From Salvador Dal&iacute;'s 1929 "La dada fotografica," in which
he reproduced associated press photographs from L&aacute;szl&oacute;
Moholy-Nagy's <i>Painting Photography Film</i>, to the format and content
of <i>A.C.</i>, modeled after magazines like <i>Das Neue Frankfurt</i>,
the influence of the German "New Objectivity" photography was clearly
established in Barcelona before Michaelis arrived in 1933-34.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Nor was she alone in pursuing a career in photography that drew
 upon all of the medium's modern applications. Her work did, however,
 embody more radically than any other of her contemporaries in Spain
 the qualities of the "document" and photography's exhibition value as
 put forth by Moholy-Nagy and Benjamin. In doing so, her erasure of aura
 and origin as measures of artistic worth were based, as Benjamin noted,
 "on another practice&#8212;politics" ("TWOA," 224).

<p>
How successful her practice was, as a political gesture, depends upon
where we stand as interpreters. The photographs that she published in
<i>A.C.</i>, and even more those which she took and published during the
Civil War in magazines like <i>Nova Iberia</i>, had a tremendous impact
on viewers of the period and historians of Spanish culture

<b></b>

into the present. However, the implications of her photographs for
an interpretation of culture that includes gender could only be more
fully established with the identification of Michaelis as the author
of these same photographs. Once acknowledged as the author of images
that were signposts for modernity in Spain, the relationship between
herself as photographer and her subjects becomes more complex. That
a Jewish, anarchist woman from Austria came and took some of the
twentieth-century's most recognizable images of Spanish architecture
and urban culture <i>is</i> significant, for it opens up the history of
modernity in Spain to issues of gender, class, and nationality. Moreover,
it imbeds within the fabric of modernity itself a case which rewrites
typical categories of authorship, gender, and artistic value.

<p>
American poets became modernist in the 1910s not merely by embracing a new
set of formal techniques, but by immersing themselves in the milieu of
the machine-age metropolis. Poetry's turn in subject matter has always
been neglected because it contravenes the long-consensual view that
modernism was defined by its repudiation of urban-industrial modernity.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 But one of the salient facts of early modernism is this: beginning
 suddenly around 1911, a vast range of American poets, whose predecessors
 had largely shunned modern subjects, took up the industrial city as
 a challenge, and an opportunity, to reimagine poetry's value for the
 twentieth century. Their willingness to engage with urban modernity
 may have been crucial to the very continuation of poetry in the United
 States. In the decades since the Civil War, as American life came to
 be defined more and more by the impersonal terms of urban experience,
 custodians of the nation's verse had stubbornly refused to engage with
 these actualities, creating a crisis in which many predicted poetry
 would simply wither away as "the rickety dream-child of neurotic
 aestheticism."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 The many verses of the 1910s about skyscrapers, subway travel, movies,
 vaudeville shows, baseball games, automated lunchrooms, and other
 aggressively modern subjects, were responses to that crisis equally
 as crucial to modernism's rejuvenating capacity as poets' adoption
 of free verse or Imagist techniques of representation. These verses
 asserted American poetry's ability to recreate itself as relevant to
 modern American life.

<b></b>

<p>
The richest category of this early twentieth-century urban verse is
perhaps cityscape poetry, which employs a variety of representational
strategies to evoke the metropolitan environment in panoramic visual
terms.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 The icon of modernity most potent in American cityscape poetry was
 the great building, a structure of unprecedented physical scale and
 grandeur that punctuated the burgeoning industrial metropolis. Most
 modern great buildings possessing this iconic power were venues for
 commerce, transport, or amusement, public not usually in ownership
 but in spatial accessibility, designed to accommodate a large number
 and variety of occupants, both permanent and transient. American
 verse written between 1910 and 1925 exhibits a persistent fascination
 with several types of modern great buildings&#8212;railroad stations,
 department stores, hotels, theaters, sports arenas&#8212;but most of
 all with the skyscraper.

<p>
The skyscraper is the central visual symbol of capitalist modernity,
as September 2001 forcibly reminded us, and has been so for a hundred
years. To American poets of the early twentieth century, as to painters
and photographers, skyscrapers resonated with tremendous, if profoundly
paradoxical, symbolic and emotional power.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 On the one hand, soaring into the heavens, taking up whole city blocks,
 housing many thousands of people, the skyscraper of a century ago was
 understood as an exhilarating harbinger of modernity's possibilities,
 "the footprint of the twentieth century," as <i>Munsey's</i> remarked
 in 1899.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The herculean scale of these new buildings was matched by their
 daunting complexity as technological, social, and economic systems,
 which required precise mastery of "thousands of intricate details"
 by planners and engineers.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Machine-age America's abiding fascination with visual intricacy and
 structural accessibility was expressed in the cunning stylings of such
 skyscrapers as the Woolworth Building, admired by the architectural
 critic Montgomery Schuyler for allowing people on the street pleasing
 access to the detailing of the uppermost floors in all its "distinctness
 and sharpness."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
But even as their synthesis of enormity, intricacy, and structural
accessibility could be read as the triumph of system-building, skyscrapers
also reminded observers that prevailing rationalist and individualist
models of cultural value were being drastically altered by the imperatives
of consolidating industrial capitalism. Skyscrapers promised to redefine
the parameters of American modernity along a sprawling scale in which
the individual, even the exceptional one, mattered less than the forces
of the corporate, the aggregate, the mass. Walter Pritchard Eaton
was only one early commentator who noted a tight parallel between the
growing enormity of buildings and the magnitude and impersonality of
the corporations behind many of them: "The phrase 'Big Business' has
leapt into the language, because the thing itself has shot up into the
economic structure, even as our skyscrapers have shot up on every street."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Arthur Goodrich called the drive to the skies an "inexorable force over
 which its makers have no control," while Eaton saw the skyscraper city's
 inhabitants as "midgets who have moulded mountains and who have then
 been moulded by them, played upon by the environment they have created"
 (<i>NY</i>, 6).
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Many early descriptions used the staggering numbers of component
 parts in skyscrapers to create ritualized litanies of mass statistics:
 35 million bricks in the Metropolitan Life Tower, and 2462 miles of
 telegraph and

<b></b>

telephone wire; enough glass in the Woolworth Building's exterior windows
to create a giant awning extending over all of Madison Square; enough
horsepower in the Woolworth's giant boilers to lift a hundred Statues
of Liberty at one time, and so on.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 No matter how comically arbitrary these transformations of one
 type of mass into another might become, they asserted the relative
 insignificance of any individual element&#8212;even the owner of
 the building.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 For each larger-than-life ego like F. W. Woolworth, driven to construct,
 in the words of <i>Citizen Kane</i>'s sardonic newsreel, "the costliest
 monument a man has built to himself," there was a Metropolitan Life
 or Equitable Insurance Corporation, using sober actuarial paradigms
 to calculate the value of its skyscraper in rentable office space and
 public relations impact. And even Woolworth had made his fortune by
 selling millions of people hundreds of millions of cheap tiny things.

<p>
Not surprisingly given these tensions between individual and mass,
there was a persistent paradox threaded through the futuristic hoopla
surrounding early skyscrapers. On the one hand, as crowning achievements
of rational system-building, they seemed to convey their inhabitants
and observers toward global communication, toward efficient management
of resources, toward a modern future without boundaries. Yet these very
hyperrationalist significations carried an ambiguous charge: skyscrapers
took shape out of "an enormous puzzle of interwoven lines and numerals
and hieroglyphics worked out on many broad drawing-boards" ("BOAOB,"
2959). As this imagery of hermetic codes and signs suggests, these
buildings put new mysteries into play, and their vast scale confounded
adequate comprehension of their possible functions or meanings. This
ambiguity gave rise to a mythic-anthropological rhetoric that often
ironically linked the skyscraper to exotic environments of hermetic
insularity. The skyscraper city constituted a powerful challenge
to the Enlightenment-capitalist ideal of rationally planned cities
built in low-rise radial shapes, dominated by single-use properties,
assuming healthful but not inaccessible boundaries between work and
home environments. This older urban ideal seemed to be giving way
to an amazingly dense vertical model in which the clamoring chaos of
the streets was kept at bay by technologically advanced, communally
conred modular structures, theoretically of unlimited size, so fully
meeting their inhabitants' needs that leaving them might prove altogether
unnecessary. What future did it augur for human society that, as Ray
Stannard Baker put it in 1899, "a man might live in a modern skyscraper
year in and year out, luxuriously, too, with every want richly supplied,
and never pass beyond the revolving storm doors at the street entrance?"
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 One answer to that question was provided by the guidebook and travel
 publisher Moses King, whose postcard "Future New York: The City of
 Skyscrapers" (1910s) offered a paradigmatic cityscape&#8212;staple
 of later science fiction films from <i>Metropolis</i> to <i>The Fifth
 Element</i>&#8212;consisting of buildings so tall and densely grouped
 that they appear to give no viable access to the ground at all. (<A
 NAME="1" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#1"> 1</a>)

<p>
In this view of skyscraper modernity, urbanites were imagined
as contemporary "Cliff Dwellers," a metaphor that drew upon the
turn-of-the-century fascination with the Anasazi peoples who had built
eyrie-like dwellings high on the mesas of New Mexico,

<b></b>

Colorado, Arizona, and Utah at some unknown time in the distant past
(later determined to be between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries). In
the late 1880s, anthropologists and mountaineers had begun to explore,
photograph, and write about these remarkable places, emphasizing the
architectural acumen, tactical ingenuity, and sheer nerve of those who
built and lived in them.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 In early accounts these spaces conveyed a strong sense of the
 uncanny, which was not due merely to their extreme spatial
 inaccessibility. Commentators were also fascinated by the Cliff
 Dwellers' unknown origins, and by their seemingly sudden and unmotivated
 disappearance from places that seemed tactically impregnable even by
 much later standards.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Adding further to the mystery surrounding them was the belief that the
 Cliff Dwellers' remains showed a puzzling mixture of physiognomies,
 and their artifacts a marked eclecticism of style and sophistication,
 both of which implied a greater degree of interchange with the outside
 world than their hermetic living spaces seemed to admit.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
In 1893, the Cliff Dwellers were brought vividly into the consciousness
of hundreds of thousands of machine-age urbanites through an exhibit
at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, featuring a massive composite
simulation of a cliff, painted to resemble rock, into which were cut
tiny apertures approximating their living spaces, along with relics and
"portions of the real houses" taken from a dig in Colorado.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 (<a name="2" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#2"> 2</a>) The
 use of the Cliff Dwellers to describe the new spaces being created in
 the skyscraper metropolis was already in the Chicago air even before
 this exhibit went on public view. Also in 1893, the Chicago novelist
 Henry Blake Fuller published his novel

<b></b>

<i>The Cliff Dwellers</i> , which cemented the metaphor's
applicability to modern urbanites. Fuller's novel is one of the
earliest attempts to integrate the skyscraper setting into the genre of
social-realist fiction. His most original stroke was a mock-ethnographic
introduction presenting the book's narrative as an analysis of the site
of a new culture that needed to be named and understood:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Between the former site of old Fort Dearborn and the present site of our
newest Board of Trade there lies a restricted yet tumultuous territory
through which, during the course of the last fifty years, the rushing
streams of commerce have worn many a deep and rugged chasm . . . . Each of
these ca&ntilde;ons is closed in by a long frontage of towering cliffs,
and these soaring walls of brick and limestone and granite rise higher
and higher with each succeeding year, according as the work of erosion at
their bases goes onward&#8212;the work of that seething flood of carts,
carriages, omnibuses, cabs, cars, messengers, shoppers, clerks, and
capitalists, which surges with increasing violence for every passing day.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Fuller's facetious archaeology of the Chicago Loop centers on the Clifton
Building, a fictional eighteen-story skyscraper housing "four thousand
souls," and featuring wonderful elevating devices that "ameliorate
the daily cliff-climbing for the frail of physique and the pressed for
time" (<i>TCD</i>, 4). His narrative captures vividly the skyscraper's
paradoxical combination of variety and insularity, spatial openness and
hermetic inaccessibility.

<b></b>

The Clifton's "tribe" is notably fluid and "heterogeneous," containing
all walks of life from bankers to janitors, all of whom seem to be
recent arrivals from elsewhere (<i>TCD</i>, 4-5, 12). Of course the
building enables state-of-the-art accessibility to distant places,
so that "the warriors" of commerce may "communicate their messages,
hostile or friendly, to chiefs more or less remote" (<i>TCD</i>, 5). Yet
in gathering its vast variety of functions and resources into a single
space, the Clifton aims above all "to be complete in itself," to make it
"unnecessary" for its inhabitants, their archaeologist, or his readers to
"go afield either far or frequently" (<i>TCD</i>, 5).
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
A great deal of writing on skyscrapers between 1890 and 1915 emphasized
this incongruous mixture of hypertechnologized urban space with the
unknowable, uncanny, and hermetic landscape of the western desert. A
writer in <i>Munsey's</i> in 1898 noted that many streets "are already
darkened by the huge cliffs of masonry that rise above them"; in
<i>Collier's</i> C. P. Cushing objected to the "cheerless ca&ntilde;onlike
streets" created by the skyscrapers.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 C. F. Carter, writing in <i>The Technical World</i>, a venue we might
 expect to embrace the skyscraper, remarked on the menace to health
 and life from "the crowded warrens of the cliff dwellers towering
 . . . three hundred feet into the air on either side of the narrow
 slits called streets."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 In 1911, Edgar Allen Forbes synthesized these images and anxieties into
 a powerful vision of the future skyscraper city as "a collection of
 towns and villages under separate roofs," each "complete unto itself,"
 its elevators like "street railways running perpendicularly." The
 surrounding streets will be "canyons of a depth varying from 200 to
 400 feet, through which the wind will sweep like gales," and "the sky
 will be practically blotted out" from this "city of electric lights
 on the brightest days," which is inhabited by businessmen who seldom
 glimpse the sky at all.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 These are but a few of dozens of similar references to cliff and
 canyon (usually spelled <i>ca&ntilde;on</i>), which became consensual
 metaphors for the urban spaces, at once rational and mysterious,
 that were being remade by the rise of skyscrapers. (<a name="3"
 href="10.1newcomb_res.html#3"> 3</a>) Mildred Stapley noted
 that the "ca&ntilde;on streets" of lower Manhattan were the consequence
 of intractably contradictory requirements: economic efficiency dictated
 that builders maximize rentable space right up to the property line,
 yet code forbade any part of a building to extend into air space that
 was not over part of its lot.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 The inevitable result was the "sheer vertical wall deviating neither
 outward nor inward."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 Eaton best captured the paradoxical character of this imagery with this
 1915 remark: "Through the ca&ntilde;ons he has made, Man hustles and
 bustles, creating more perplexities than he can solve" (<i>NY</i>, 4).

<p>
The practical strictures of skyscraper-building may have perplexed and
darkened the streets of lower Manhattan, but they also helped beget new
aesthetic styles and notions of beauty. Eaton's 1915 account of his
evolving attachment to the skyscraper city reveals an important link
between its sheer lines, massive forms, and constantly changing state,
and an emerging aesthetic of modernism. At first perceiving the city as
"miles and miles of ugly dwellings, cave dwellings where people lived in
layers" (<i>NY</i>, 5), Eaton comes to love the "mortared Himalayas" of
Manhattan's streets, and credits skyscrapers and the spaces they create
("great crags in the walls of a man-made ca&ntilde;on") for providing
him with an aesthetic of beauty appropriate to the twentieth century,

<b></b>

modernist in all but name, that repudiates "symmetry" and "conformity"
(<i>NY</i>, 10), and instead embraces ceaseless variety (<i>NY</i>, 6),
"stirring challenge" (<i>NY</i>, 9), "endless surprises" (<i>NY</i>,
7), "sudden revelation. . . amid apparent ugliness" (<i>NY</i>, 9), and
anything that "rouses the eye to keener attention" (<i>NY</i>, 10). These
are the very qualities that drew the eyes, brushes, and cameras of
modernist visual artists to skyscrapers and cityscapes. Indeed, the
artist Robert MacCameron concluded in 1913 that the modern city's new
lines and forms augured a twentieth-century aesthetic that would emerge
across many genres, as the skyscraper's "freshening of the vision"
was sure to catalyze "fresh problems and solutions in other forms of art."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
American poets of the 1910s and early 1920s would perceive that
same allure, and explore those new notions of beauty, as they used
cityscape verse to work toward a vigorous modernist aesthetic capable of
negotiating, even embracing, the paradoxical conditions of modernity. In
their poems, skyscrapers carry a wide range of emotional meanings,
and function within a range of political discourses from capitalist
intimidation to revolutionary praxis. In short, they exhibit the depth,
variety, and complexity that the most resonant symbols of a cultural
moment possess. Some verses read the skyscraper city as an image
of bleakly depersonalized modernity, others as a locus of utopian
possibility. Most bear the traces of both these responses at once,
experiencing the skyscraper city as contradiction, instability, and
challenge. Perceiving the metropolitan grid as an arresting abstract
pattern of lights and lines that rivals the creations

<b></b>

of nature, they ponder how to balance this detached aesthetic perspective
with empathetic connection with others. As they feel the skyscraper
city hurtling them into a future of unimaginable marvels, they question
whether the constantly mutating metropolis would allow any meaningful
relationship with the past. As skyscrapers inspire them to new metaphors
for conceptualizing mass society, they worry that a society defined by
its masses might prove wholly inaccessible to the powers of poetry. As
they perceive the skyscraper's transformative power, promising access
to new levels of experience and understanding, they wonder whether it
will take them places human beings would want to go.

1 Challenging the Skies
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The young American poets who began to write about the modern metropolis
in the early 1910s had grown up while skyscrapers were rising in the
nation's cities. Since 1905 they had witnessed a breathtaking increase in
the height of the tallest structures, the culmination of thirty years of
skyscraper development. In the last decades of the century, the economic
imperative for taller buildings, which one early commentator called "the
capitalization of the air," had become enormous in the densest and most
desirable commercial areas such as lower Manhattan and the Chicago Loop,
as rents had become "prohibitive," and the purchase of land "impossible."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 For many years, the tallest structure in Manhattan had been the spire
 of Trinity Church on lower Broadway at 284 feet, asserting, as Thomas
 van Leeuwen notes, the longstanding "material claim of the church
 on the territory between Earth and Heaven"; but by 1880 Trinity had
 begun to function as a "mere yardstick for any new skyscraper that
 was thought fit to carry the name."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Through the 1880s, steel-frame technology, which theoretically
 eliminated height restrictions upon architects' imaginations, were
 rendered practical possibilities by the continuing refinement of
 the high-speed electric elevator, and the falling cost and better
 quality control of steel. The success of the nine-story Home Life
 Insurance Company in Chicago (William LeBaron Jenney, 1884), the
 ten-story Wainwright Building in St. Louis (Louis Sullivan, 1890-91),
 and other experiments indicated that the steel-clad tower could look
 good, inspire public wonderment, and make its owners money. Even
 so, various factors, including residual skepticism that buildings
 several hundred feet high could be physically stable, retarded great
 increases in height for some years after the principles of steel-frame
 construction were established. By 1900 the world's tallest building was
 the Park Row Building in lower Manhattan (R. H. Robertson, 1899), which
 rose 383 feet (thirty stories). The most distinctive modern structure
 in the artistic and cultural landscape of New York City before 1905,
 the Fuller Building, better known as the Flatiron (D. H. Burnham Co.,
 1902), was, at twenty-one stories, still under 300 feet high.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Still, the drive to the skies had begun in earnest, and the visual
 scale of Manhattan life was being altered from street level to hundreds
 of feet in the air. In 1890, only six buildings in New York City rose
 as high as ten stories: by 1908 there were 538 such buildings, and by
 the end of 1912 this number had doubled again, to 1048.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
In the decade after 1905, the emergence of the twentieth-century
skyscraper would culminate in three lower Manhattan behemoths, each
in succession the tallest building in the world, which became magnetic
icons of the city for modernist writers, painters, and photographers:
the Singer Tower (612 feet, Ernest Flagg; completed 1908, demolished
1967), the Metropolitan Life Tower (700 feet, Napoleon LeBrun &amp; Sons,
1909), and the Woolworth Building (792 feet, Cass Gilbert, 1913). The
heaven-storming years that produced these three skyscrapers can hardly
be overestimated as a defining moment of urban modernity. Because of
the more height-restrictive zoning laws of the mid-1910s, and the more
conservative business climate produced by the Great War, these towers
stood as the three tallest in the world until after 1920, and the 700-foot
barrier was not eclipsed again until 1930.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
Virtually everyone who approached Manhattan from the south or west
during the last thirty-five years of the twentieth century remembers,
now painfully, seeing the bland yet unmistakable twin towers of the
World Trade Center as the first visible signs of the city. Before 1930,
the very tallest buildings were even more prominent signifiers of the
metropolis. The Singer, Metropolitan, and Woolworth towers dwarfed
almost every other building in the city by hundreds of feet, and were
not obscured by a forest of surrounding skyscrapers until the 1950s. They
could be seen from virtually every prospect in greater New York City.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 An early booklet for the observation deck on the 50th floor of the
 Metropolitan Tower claimed plausibly that from there one could see
 "the homes of over one-sixteenth of the entire population of the United
 States" (<i>MLIC</i>, 45-46). The reverse must also have been true:
 certainly millions of people would have seen the Metropolitan, Singer,
 and Woolworth buildings, virtually every day of their lives.

<p>
Commanding this level of visual prominence and novelty, the tallest
skyscrapers became a form of spectacular popular culture, providing
symbolic currency in an era in which points of common understanding were
generally perceived to be disappearing. For better or worse, they were
the modern urban analogues of the small-town churches and schoolhouses
around which most American lives had once revolved: instantly recognizable
structures whose distinctive architectural features carried vivid, complex
cultural meanings, as compass-needles, gathering places, repositories of
civic and national pride&#8212;as sites of virtually every type of social
interaction, from ruthlessly commercial to frivolously recreational.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 As such, they laid a forceful claim on anyone interested in representing
 the defining features of urban modernity: painters, photographers,
 commercial artists; manufacturers of postcards, souvenirs, toys,
 almost every imaginable genre of material culture; and poets.

<p>
The opening ceremonies of the 792-foot Woolworth Building in 1913 evoked
the skyscraper's complex significance in the cultural landscape of
twentieth-century modernity. On the evening of 24 April, hundreds of feet
off the ground, a distinguished group of 800 guests gathered including,
as well as the expected industrialists and bankers, a member of the
Wilson cabinet, various foreign diplomats, three lieutenant governors,
and nearly twenty percent of the U. S. Congress from 28 states.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 When everyone was seated, all the building's exterior and interior
 lights were extinguished, and

<b></b>

exactly at 7:30 PM, President Wilson at the White House pressed a
button, igniting all of its 80,000 lights, "enough to illuminate
the entire 40-mile waterfront of Manhattan," no doubt as stunning an
effect to the crowds watching for miles around as to the dignitaries
inside (<i>SQMP</i>, 89-90). This dramatic event conjoined a variety
of political, commercial, technological, and aesthetic meanings into a
thoroughly ambiguous spectacle. On the one hand, it demonstrated that a
single skyscraper's reach extended not only throughout the metropolitan
area but to the seat of national government. The fact that such a
building so confidently, competently <i>worked</i> evoked a modernity of
complex interconnected elements that promised to be manageable through the
unending advance of industrial technologies and organizational skills. On
the other hand, mystifying an enormously laborious effort of construction
and wiring into a single magical instant of illumination, it asked
observers to accommodate another possible modernity, this one so massive
in scale and hermetic in character as to defy individual comprehension.

<p>
Not surprisingly given the association of skyscrapers with such monumental
spectacle, one group of poetic responses represented them as looming
ominously over the more humanly-scaled structures of the city, monstrous
in their sheer height and bulk, symbols of modern capital at its most
unaccountable and self-congratulatory. In his prize-winning poem for
the 1912 anthology <i>The Lyric Year</i>, "Second Avenue," Orrick Johns
indicts the ever-expanding array of skyscrapers as a "jagged line of
mist-enshrouded masonry" that "you, my people, reared and built/ To be
a temple and a shrine/ For gods of iron and gilt."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 In "Lines to the Woolworth Building" , the anarchist poet and
 sculptor Adolf Wolff admits that the Woolworth, completed only that
 year, "awes my soul," but quickly goes on to condemn it as a "monstrous
 sacrilege" because never "has thing so big been made for end so small."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Wolff is playing here with the specific incongruity of a
 five-and-ten-cent store housing itself in the world's tallest
 building; his more general point, of course, is that the Woolworth as
 an achievement is vitiated because it commemorates only "the priests
 of lucre" ("LTTWB," 29).
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Appropriate, therefore, that the building's "pallor" was "like in
 color to the tint of bones," its "slender, upright lines" "so much
 like children's bones" ("LTTWB," 29). Wolff ended with a fervent but
 conceptually banal condemnation of the building to the dust: like
 the pyramids, "tyrants' tombs, built by a million slaves," "ere long/
 Thou'lt be the relic of an age gone by" ("LTTWB," 29). Drawing from
 late genteel poetry's fusty reservoir of antiquarian imagery, such
 castigations of the idolatrous skyscraper espoused the conventional
 sentiments that poets had been expected to produce for decades. But
 they were not typical of American verse of the 1910s, which more often
 acknowledged both the intimidating potential of these great buildings,
 and also their allure as creations peculiarly expressive of modernity.

<p>
Many other poems, especially those in the radical orbit of <i>The
Masses</i> and <i>The Liberator</i>, tended to read the skyscraper as an
emblem of modernity defined by the limitless possibilities of communal
effort. The octave of John Reed's sonnet "Foundations of a Skyscraper"
(1910s) evokes the "ghastly" aspects of the construction process
("Thunder of drills, stiff spurting plumes of steam,-/ Shouts and the
dip of cranes, the

<b></b>

stench of earth"), but also treats this as a site of human possibility,
since out of an inferno of exploitative labor, "men give a vision birth,/
Crawling and dim, men build a dreamer's dream."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The poem maintains a valuable balance between the utopian vision
 of "A phantom of fairtowers in the sky" and the grittier assertion
 that the true "foundation" of the skyscraper is human labor ("FOAS,"
 38). The sestet reinforces this convergence with a striking image of
 the building in the strenuous posture of the workman who built it:
 "Naked, a giant's back, tight-muscled, stark,/ Glimpse of mighty
 shoulder, etched in steel" ("FOAS," 38).

<p>
Reed's reference to "the clamor of unknown tongues" ("FOAS," 38) in the
skyscraper's construction site evokes the heterogeneous ethnic makeup
of its workforce, and the class-consciousness that such an enterprise
might promote, no doubt in spite of its developer's desires. Pursuing
this line of thought further, two poems published in <i>The Liberator</i>
celebrate great buildings as empowering icons of radical consciousness,
foreshadowing in verbal terms the representational strategies that Lewis
Hine would use a few years later to photograph the workers constructing
the Empire State Building in <i>Men at Work</i> . Like Hine's
photos, Raymond Corder's "The Skyscraper"  and Stirling Bowen's
"Skyscraper"  convert the modern capitalist tower into an emblem
of the utopian possibilities of collaborative human effort.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 Corder's poem begins, "All that steel frame-work bristling in the
 sun/ Is something we have done" ("TS," 21). The physical labor of
 construction ("We sweated, we plugged, and built it, span by span") has
 enabled the workers to think of themselves as the building's "creators,"
 and therefore, its rightful owners: "And every rusty beam that skyward
 towers/ Is ours&#8212;we built it&#8212;It is ours!" ("TS," 21). The
 poem's distinctive proletarian voice uses a high-spirited slang to
 acknowledge the obligations of doctrine ("Sure, buddy, sure, I know/
 The boss has got it now-he'll have to go" ["TS," 21]), but prefers to
 admire the building a bit longer as an object of beauty and a source
 of pride, a central constituent in a materialist-modernist aesthetic
 that valorizes collective human achievement above natural verities:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
But, say, boy, watch them clouds,
<br />
They seem to stand still while that eye-beam strouds
<br />
Across the sky.-She's pretty, ain't she, son?
<br />
That piece of work we've done. ("TS," 21)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As many of Hine's photos feature iconic human res who echo the shape
of buildings or extend the implied motion of machines, Bowen's sonnet
"Skyscraper" suggests how heavy machinery exponentially magnifies the
power of the ordinary worker: "One man mops his brow/ And, spitting,
scoops two tons of dirt up now/ In one iron fist.&#8212;plain Mike
or Tom or Pete" ("S," 13). Extending the individual human frame, with
"fist" and "great arms," the crane incarnates the growing strength of
the proletariat as a collective body ("S," 13). Bowen flatly refuses
to interpret the building's massive scale as a parable of hubris, and
instead appropriates the imagery of pagan idolatry for the "clear godless"
nature of this human enterprise: "No god can muddle anything we

<b></b>

try!" ("S," 13) The building is indeed "Babel's modern tower," since
it has drawn together a multiethnic workforce who "confuse the Yankee
tongue," but this is a source of affirmation as well, as the skyscraper
becomes the magnificent result of their growing class consciousness
("S," 13).

<p>
The skyscraper's contradictory ability to embody both the depersonalizing
mystifications of corporate capitalism, and the limitless possibilities
of collective labor, is acutely articulated by Arturo Giovannitti's "The
Day of War: Madison Square, June 20th," published in <i>The Masses</i>
for August 1916, in an oppressive atmosphere of patriotic rhetoric and
preparedness parades.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Giovannitti introduces in the first line a "hawk-faced youth with
 rapacious eyes, standing on a shaky chair" who exhorts an alienated
 and scattered crowd, "idle, yawning, many-hungered, beggarly," to
 embrace the cause of radical labor ("TDOW," 283). Studded with images of
 bellicosity, this young man embodies the hard line of <i>The Masses</i>'
 revolutionary persona, as "his red tie flows tempestuously in the wind,
 the unfurled banner of his heart amidst the musketry of his young
 words" ("TDOW," 283). But he also has a human communicativeness and
 vulnerability otherwise lacking from the clamorous physical textures of
 the urban street. Giovannitti places him at the heart of the capitalist
 skyscraper city, "in the roar of the crossways, under the tower that
 challenges the skies, terrible like a brandished sword" ("TDOW,"
 283). The humanity and sincerity of this warlike youth contrast to
 the other version of war that erupts upon the street, which is all
 the more intimidating for being disjointed and depersonalized: "the
 blast of a trumpet, its notes ramming like bullets against the white
 tower./ The soldiers march up the Avenue. The crowd breaks, scatters,
 and runs away, and only six listeners remain" ("TDOW," 283). Though we
 get nothing more than this fragmentary glimpse of the military parade,
 it breaks the spell of the boy's rhetoric, dissipates the "island
 of silence" his voice had created amidst the "roar" of the city, and
 sends most of his audience scurrying aimlessly away ("TDOW," 283). As
 the last listeners drift off one by one (even the poet's alter ego,
 whom he calls "the stranger I know"), until only a single young woman
 is left, Giovannitti acknowledges the difficulty of resistance to a
 capitalist modernity that enforces conformism by isolating people from
 one another ("TDOW," 283).

<p>
However, this story is not over: as Giovannitti repeats four times in
the second half of the poem, "But he speaks on" ("TDOW," 283). The boy's
persistence marks his cause as indomitable, as does the girl who remains
transfixed, "her upturned face glowing before the brazier of his soul,"
proving that his words need not inevitably fall on deaf ears, and can
produce tangible results in the world ("TDOW," 283). At the end he,
she, and the tower "are the only three things that stand straight
and rigid and inexpugnable/ Amidst the red omens of war" ("TDOW,"
283). Though Giovannitti never names this building, he certainly has
in mind the Metropolitan Life Tower, sited on the southeast corner
of Madison Square, at 700 feet the area's tallest building by far,
and containing on its white walls the largest clock in the world. (<A
NAME="4" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#4"> 4</a>) At the
beginning of the poem, the tower may seem just another depersonalized
and alienating element of the modern capitalist city. Yet even at that
point the building is associated with the speaking boy just beneath,
as he mimics its height by standing on a chair. When he exhorts

<b></b>

the crowd, "his shadow is heavy and hard upon their faces," as the tower's
must also be ("TDOW," 283). At the poem's end, only the girl remains,
one resolute listener to match the boy's indomitable speech, and the
tower's great clock strikes twelve: "one by one drop at his feet the
twelve tolls of the clock that marks time, the time that knows and flows
on until his day comes" ("TDOW," 283). By associating the timekeeping
tower with the young radicals, Giovannitti proposes a Marxian reading of
capitalist modernity as an era that has generated both greater levels
of inhumane exploitation, and also the class consciousness necessary
for radical change, whose time is inexorably approaching. For him and
other leftist poets of the era, the skyscraper tower signifies not
just alienating and inhumane modernity, but the human race's ability
to create things. Its great strength, its inexpugnability, even its
shape that rebels against supposedly eternal verities ("challenges the
skies")&#8212;all these qualities make the skyscraper central to an
iconography of revolutionary modernism.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
2 Abyss, Eternity, Threshold
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In modernist poems the skyscraper tower often represents rocklike
strength, for obvious reasons; yet as a symbol it is remarkably tensile,
allowing Giovannitti to reshape a monument to corporate capitalism into
a harbinger of Marxist revolution. This malleability of symbolic function
is congruent with another of the skyscraper's paradoxical

<b></b>

signifying powers: the ability to transform temporal and spatial
principles previously perceived as immutable. A host of early modernist
writers explored great buildings as liminal spaces, thresholds to new
dimensions of consciousness or experience, windows into the future or the
past, or harbingers of radical, even apocalyptic change. Harriet Monroe,
the poet of her generation most deeply engaged with urban modernity,
noted that in many climatic circumstances skyscrapers extended past the
limits of visual perception to create a sublime vertigo that confused
terrestrial and celestial: "The many-windowed walls uprear so high/
They dim and quiver and float away in mist/ Tangling the earth and sky."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Walter Pritchard Eaton likewise perceived the skyscraper's vastness
 outstripping identifiable climatic zones, in effect transcending weather
 itself: "On foggy days the Singer Building and its sister peaks go up
 out of sight into the vapors. Again, on days of heavy atmosphere and
 lowering rain . . . I have seen the lower portions of the buildings
 obliterated, and only their summits reared on nothing into the gray
 air, a dream city, unbelievable, ethereal, immense" (<i>NY</i>,
 21-22). Images of crossing and transformation re frequently in
 commentaries upon these buildings that made people feel themselves
 "on the abyss of eternity."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 One of the most imaginative of these was by Ray Stannard Baker, who
 described the steel-frame skyscraper as "more a bridge than a building"
 ("TMS," 48). In Baker's vision of a horizontal structure somehow also
 becoming vertical, the supporting steel girders are "big bridges,"
 and elevators the vehicles conveying us into some unknown region in
 the heavens ("TMS," 56, 48). Eaton too imagined skyscrapers at night
 as vertical thoroughfares rising into the air, proposing that the
 "upward rows of lights" give lower Manhattan "exactly the aspect of
 a town of many streets running up a great dome-like hill, each little
 house by the roadside imagined from its square of light" (<i>NY</i>,
 22). The skyscraper's ability to blur fundamental spatial distinctions
 between vertical and horizontal, between earth and heavens, gave it
 an uncanny liminal force.

<p>
As it made people feel they were teetering on the very edges of space
and time, the liminal skyscraper catalyzed some poets into hallucinatory
visions of nightmare modernity. Armond Carroll's "From a City Street"
 offers a surreal portrait of "harpies of our modern time," who
perch on the "crags which high uplift/ Their steel-knit skeletons" above
"the surfs that surge and shift."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 The trope of people surging and ebbing among the enormous buildings
 like a restless "surf" can also be read as a punning reference to their
 serfdom to the forces of modernity tossing them about. Far above the
 street, these harpies both "mock the futile restless waves/ That surge
 in great affair below," and ironically "hail to wide oblivious graves/
 The victims of the undertow."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The simultaneous mocking and hailing implies that a society gets
 the imaginative icons it deserves; these harpies, however murky and
 unsatisfying, are faithful emblems of the chaotic and depredatory
 culture that constructed the crags they inhabit. Their mocking is thus
 appropriate commemoration for that culture's victims. The apocalyptic
 resonance of the heaven-storming tower, implicit in Carroll's
 skyscraper-Gothic, comes to the fore in Horace Holley's "Skyscrapers"
 , which compares the skyline to "a forest of strange palms"
 apparently not subject to natural laws: they don't sway in wind,
 "nor nod sleepy at evening," nor offer to "nestling birds/ A warm

and comfortable mossy bough."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 Unnerved at these contraventions of the natural order, the speaker
 hurls at the skyscrapers the apocalyptic prediction that nature must
 ultimately reassert its dominion through "a furious tempest" that
 will "tear your earth-devouring roots" and rain down "terrible fruit"
 of stone upon "a shore deserted."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
The American poem that most fully explores the skyscraper as such
a liminal space comes from a writer few would even associate with
urban modernity, Sara Teasdale, whose work has been unjustifiably
miniaturized by high modernism's interlocking preconceptions about gender
and genre. Teasdale's "From the Woolworth Tower," published in the 1915
volume <i>Rivers to the Sea</i> but eventually dropped from her collected
works, consists of seventy-four lines divided into short beginning and
ending sections framing a longer central meditation. The first section
describes a couple enjoying each other's company in the city of modern
amusements, arriving "vivid with love, eager for greater beauty," into
the "brilliant and warm" corridors of the Woolworth Building ("FTWT,"
12). The elevator's "sharp unswerving flight" up to the observation deck
transports them from the everyday world into a sublime realm of unseen
and uncanny forces ("FTWT," 12). As they "shoot" through "swirling and
angry" air that "howls like a hundred devils," the speaker is highly
"Conscious of the chasm under us" ("FTWT," 12). She has entered an
unstable liminal zone in which the division between air above and earth
below can no longer be taken for granted.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 The skyscraper's liminal force intensifies when they reach the top, pass
 through "a door leading onto the ledge&#8212;," and find themselves
 perched "over the edge of eternity," accompanied only by "wind,
 night and space!" ("FTWT," 12-13). Alarmed at the "terrible height,"
 the speaker still realizes with some wonder that they have actively
 chosen to experience it ("Why have we sought you?") ["FTWT," 13]. She
 speaks here not as a bohemian seeking esoteric urban thrills, but as
 an American participating fully in the popular culture of her times:
 until its closing in 1941 due to wartime precautions, the Woolworth's
 observation deck attracted 250,000 visitors annually (<i>SQMP</i>,
 136). (. <a href="10.1newcomb_res.html#5" name="5">5</a>, <a href="10.1newcomb_res.html#6" name="6">6</a>)

<p>
The poem's second section, describing the view from the tower, negotiates
most of the key themes of cityscape poetry: the perception of the city as
abstract patterns of lights and forms that rival or displace the creations
of nature; the desire to balance this detached perspective with empathy
for others; the anxiety that the scale and impersonality of skyscraper
modernity may overwhelm the poet's communicative powers; and the uneasy
attempt to situate the modern metropolis into a meaningful relationship
with past and future. Regaining her perceptual and emotional bearings,
the speaker perceives the abstract visual drama of the city's lights ("A
thousand times more numerous than the stars") outlining its dark shapes:
"Oh lines and loops of light in unwound chains/ That mark for miles
and miles/ The vast black mazy cobweb of the streets" ("FTWT," 13). As
in much cityscape verse, the modernist visual arts provide a point of
reference for the poetic imagination: "Near us clusters and splashes
of living gold/ That change far off to bluish steel" ("FTWT," 13). This
painterly abstraction evokes the poet's sense of being transported into a
liminal city in which the familiar "strident noises" of the street float
up to them, now "hallowed into whispers" ("FTWT," 13-14). The stridency
has been hallowed out of them, but questions remain. Does the poet's

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 113]</b>

liminal sensitivity make these "whispers" comprehensible as human
utterances? Or have they simply been distanced and aestheticized into
the spectacle of the nocturnal cityscape?

<p>
The anxiety created by these questions becomes primary in the next verse
paragraph, which turns toward the human element of the city conspicuously
absent so far. But the results of this turn are immediately discouraging:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We feel the millions of humanity beneath us,-
<br />
The warm millions, moving under the roofs,
<br />
Consumed by their own desires;
<br />
Preparing food,
<br />
Sobbing alone in a garret,
<br />
With burning eyes bending over a needle,
<br />
Aimlessly reading the evening paper. . . ("FTWT," 14)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Assailed by fleeting perceptions of "the sorrow, the torpor, the
bitterness, the frail joy" of human life that "come up to us" as the
whispers had done, but now feel "like a cold fog wrapping us round,"
the speaker can muster none of Whitman's belief in "Crossing Brooklyn
Ferry" that human connection might transcend the distance between the
present moment and other ages.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 She also feels unmoved by the tower as a symbol of future human
 progress, concluding that in a hundred years "the anguish, the
 torpor, the toil/ Will have passed to other millions/ Consumed by
 the same desires," and eventually "darkness will blot the lights/
 And the tower will be laid on the earth," with only sea and stars
 remaining "unchanging" and "unconcerned" ("FTWT," 15). For Teasdale,
 the illuminating liminality the tower brings turns out to be bitterly
 ironic. As a vehicle for abstracting oneself from the moment-to-moment
 perceptual plenitude of street life for a more meditative perspective,
 as a threshold to deeper understanding, it has yielded the appalling
 conclusion that modernity is merely the clockwork acting-out of petty
 melodrama, followed by implacable apocalypse.

<p>
Instead of, say, a sober descent from the building to contrast the
exhilarating ascent, the brief final section retreats from these
anguished realizations, and announces that despite the "sorrow, futility,
defeat" all around, love "has crowned us/ For a moment/ Victors" ("FTWT,"
15). Here Teasdale attempts to complete the theme of liminality, implying
that because the building has allowed the lovers to abstract themselves
from the strident and chaotic textures of the city, to exist "on the
abyss of eternity," they have understood the power and the value of their
love more deeply than they could have done below ("FTWT," 15). But this
wishful affirmation pales next to the disillusioning force of her earlier
realizations, and whatever fleeting victory she feels is bittersweet at
best. Teasdale's eventual rejection of "From the Woolworth Tower" is
understandable given its problematic ending, but is also unfortunate,
because the poem is her most ambitious attempt to integrate the idiom
of the rhapsodic love lyric with urban modernity, a project deserving of
serious reconsideration by current historicist criticism. The alienated
futility she describes here is indeed one aspect of the modernist response
to modernity, though not the primary, much less the only one, as

<b></b>

ideologies of high modernism often assert. The poem remains illuminating
as an emotionally raw and ambivalent instance of literary modernism's
horror at depersonalized modern mass society, before this was styled
into seductive elegance by Eliot and the Fugitives, and then elevated
to high-culture dogma after World War II.

<p>
Teasdale's vision of tall buildings collapsing upon the shore in the
face of an apocalyptic storm evokes the "falling towers" of <i>The
Waste Land</i> , which are seldom considered in relation to the
modern skyscraper.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 In the beginning of "What the Thunder Said," when Eliot describes
 "mountains of rock without water" amongst which "one cannot stop or
 think," he refers most directly to the quasi-biblical desert landscape
 that has framed the entire poem and lent it a title (<i>TWL</i>, 334,
 336). But a few dozen lines later, we approach an arid "city over the
 mountains" that "cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air,"
 which leads directly to a litany of human history as a succession of
 "falling towers/ Jerusalem Athens Alexandria/ Vienna London/ Unreal"
 (<i>TWL</i>, 372-77). This associative sequence links the waste land's
 sterile mountains of rock to the "unreal" cities of modernity, a linkage
 reinforced by the adjective "violet," which Eliot had previously used
 to evoke the machine-age city at dusk ("the violet hour, when the
 eyes and back/ Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits/
 Like a taxi throbbing waiting" [<i>TWL</i>, 215-17]). Indeed, despite
 its studied timelessness that draws upon biblical parables and ancient
 vegetation rituals, the desert landscape has possessed attributes of
 the modern city all along. Most notably, existence in the waste land
 is typified, as in the city, not by true solitude ("There is not even
 solitude in the mountains"), but by an alienation from others that
 is exacerbated by there being so many of them, so many "red sullen
 faces" sneering and snarling "from doors of mudcracked houses" that
 "one can neither stand nor lie nor sit" (<i>TWL</i>, 343, 344-45,
 340). These "hooded hordes swarming/ Over endless plains, stumbling
 in cracked earth" (<i>TWL</i>, 369-70) can be seen as analogues of the
 contemporary crowd surging over London Bridge, eyes fixed before feet,
 to arrive at offices "on the final stroke of nine" (<i>TWL</i>, 68).

<p>
The last lines of <i>The Waste Land</i> memorably synthesize urban and
desert settings, as the speaker sits "upon the shore/ Fishing, with
the arid plain behind" him, his great buildings crumbling, his finely
styled phrases disintegrating into fragmented collage (which begins
"London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down") (<i>TWL</i>,
424-25, 427). Eliot prophesies a cataclysmic, if entropic, denouement
to the accelerating human expansion into the sky. The approaching
storm at the poem's end can be interpreted equally as the harbinger
of some cleansing spiritual rejuvenation, or as the cosmic <i>coup de
grace</i> upon a self-annihilating culture. Eliot's ambivalence toward
modernity, his obvious fascination with the industrial city even as he
is repulsed by it, is perhaps the most precious element of his mixed
legacy to modernism, but this largely vanishes from his work after
his conversion to Christianity. Still gripped by it in <i>The Waste
Land</i>, he articulates as forcefully as anyone the wonder and anguish
of experiencing everything that is solid, even and especially our most
massive bulwarks against instability, cracking, reforming, and bursting
in the viole(n)t air of modernity.

3 The Light That Never Fails
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The building in the Manhattan skyline most significant to American
poets before 1930 was the 700-foot Metropolitan Life Tower, located
at 1 Madison Avenue on the southeast corner of Madison Square (just
across from the Flatiron, the structure that meant the most to visual
artists). The Metropolitan Tower, an instantly recognizable structure
with several unique visual features, was integral to several poems of
the 1910s and 1920s that consider the role of poetry in modern urban
experience. The white tower that dominates Giovannitti's cityscape of
revolutionary modernity, "The Day of War: Madison Square, June 20th,"
is the Metropolitan in all but name. It also initiates the mystical
singing of William Rose Ben&eacute;t's "The Singing Skyscrapers." In the
opening lines of her exquisite lyric "Parting Gift" , Elinor Wylie,
gently teasing her partner Ben&eacute;t for his fascination with these
great structures, uses the Metropolitan as a shorthand reference for
worldly grandeur, presuming it to be a characteristic object of desire
for the modern urban subject:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I cannot give you the Metropolitan Tower.
<br />
I cannot give you heaven;
<br />
Nor the nine Visigoth crowns in the Cluny Museum;
<br />
Nor happiness, even.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Several of these poems contain glancing references to the Metropolitan's
appearance and lighting effects that may strike current readers as
murky or private. But this is our lack, not the poems', since the
tower's nocturnal spectacle, visible from virtually everywhere in the
city, must have been known to almost every Manhattanite of the early
twentieth century. Indeed, this imagery is obscure to us precisely
<i>because</i> it was so familiar to the era's poets and readers, who
needed no contextual introduction. At any rate, these poems use the
lights and other attributes of the Metropolitan Tower to articulate
a wide range of emotional states: love, disappointment, yearning for
stability, alienation, skepticism, commitment to social change. This
range of possible significations invites us to see the building as an
exemplary symbol in a poetic modernism deeply engaged with modernity.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
The first poet to explore the resonance of this exemplary great building
was again Sara Teasdale, whose lyric "The Metropolitan Tower" begins an
unofficial sequence of six poems that conclude the "Love Songs" section
of <i>Helen of Troy and Other Poems</i> .
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 All six feature titles of geographically specific settings in greater
 New York City (Gramercy Park, the Metropolitan Museum, Coney Island,
 Union Square, and Central Park); collectively they trace the unhappy
 progress of a modern love relationship. "The Metropolitan Tower"
 initiates the sequence by recounting "Love's birth" in the speaker's
 heart during an hour spent walking with a companion at dusk around
 the then brand-new skyscraper ("TMT," 29). The first two of its three
 stanzas use the tower's visual sequences and timekeeping function to
 measure the speaker's emotionally heightened time:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We walked together in the dusk
<br />
To watch the tower grow dimly white,
<br />
And saw it lift against the sky
<br />Its flower of amber light.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You talked of half a hundred things,
<br />
I kept each hurried word you said,
<br />
And when at last the hour was full,
<br />I saw the light turn red. ("TMT," 29)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The speaker's evolving commitment to her companion is precisely
articulated through the tower's sequence of lighting effects.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 (<a name="7" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#7"> 7</a>)
 The first phase of her experience corresponds to the "amber light"
 that flowers on the building's clock as dusk approaches, which here
 suggests the sense of infinite emotional possibility one perceives
 upon first feeling love ("TMT, 29). These feelings swell as the
 building's illumination brightens minute by minute, to be culminated
 by the flashes of the lantern as the "hour" reaches its end, an event
 the speaker anticipates as eagerly ("at last") and feels as intensely
 as she might the "full" consummation of her love ("TMT," 29).

<p>
But all the while, her oblivious paramour flits from one trivial
observation to another, leading us to suspect that he must eventually
disappoint her. The final stanza of "The Metropolitan Tower" foreshadows
the sequence's bleak ending, wistfully reaffirming her love despite his
unresponsive self-absorption:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You did not know the time had come,
<br />
You did not see the sudden flower,
<br />
Nor know that in my heart Love's birth
<br />
Was reckoned from that hour. ("TMT," 29)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The syntactic and rhythmic parallels of the phrases "the light turn red"
and "the time had come" create a strong sense of rhetorical momentum and
culmination, pulling us forward much as the speaker is being pulled into
deep emotional attachment, even as we note that red lights conventionally
signify impending danger ("TMT," 29). And yet, in the midst of all this
modern inconstancy, the tower signifies not impersonality or alienation:
indeed, it is the only constant in the unstable emotional milieu the
speaker has entered, and only through its steadfast presence and knowable
visual sequences can she chart her own emotional <i>dur&eacute;e</i>.

<p>
To the corporate owners of the Metropolitan Tower, this constancy was
central to its meaning and value. In 1943 the company's historian proudly
described the tower's clock, chimes, and lighting beacon, which "flashed
for miles over New York City and the neighboring towns." This beacon
advertised the dependability of Metropolitan Life, and became the basis of
one of the company's self-defining slogans, "The Light That Never Fails."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 Another early modernist poem, Lola Ridge's "Time-Stone," examines the
 Metropolitan Tower as a modern measuring device, literally marking the
 passage of time, but also serving as a symbolic locus of enumeration
 and evaluation.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 Ridge is as fascinated with the tower as Teasdale, but is certainly
 more skeptical of its <b></b> beneficence



than its corporate biographer. She develops an extraordinarily compressed
and resonant critique of the tower's entanglement in ideologies of
patriarchal capitalism. Here is the poem in full:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
HALLO, Metropolitan&#8212;
<br />
Ubiquitous windows staring all ways,
<br />
Red eye notching the darkness.
<br />
No use to ogle that slip of a moon.
<br />
This midnight the moon,
<br />
Playing virgin after all her encounters,
<br />
Will break another date with you.
<br />
You fuss an awful lot,
<br />
You flight of ledger books,
<br />
Overrun with multiple ant-black res
<br />
Dancing on spindle legs
<br />
An interminable can-can.

<b></b>

<br />
But I'd rather . . . like the cats in the alley . . . count time
<br />
By the silver whistle of a moonbeam
<br />
Falling between my stoop-shouldered walls,
<br />
Than all your tally of the sunsets,
<br />
Metropolitan, ticking among stars. ("TSS," 51)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The title portrays the tower as a device of temporal measurement, a
sort of gigantic sundial, monumental and timeless in its association
with ancient products of human ingenuity. This particular time-stone,
however, also possesses a specifically modern character, signified first
of all by its panoptical capabilities ("Ubiquitous windows staring all
ways"), and by its function as enormous searchlight and beacon ("Red
eye notching the darkness"). The metaphor of notching&#8212;marking a
surface with a cut, for the purpose of measuring, counting, or keeping a
record&#8212;has both temporal and spatial functions in the poem. The red
flashes of the tower's lights notch the night temporally, into a finite
number of fifteen-minute segments; and spatially, darting outward to
illuminate and arrange the otherwise incoherent space of "the darkness"
into finite and discrete units. The illumination and arrangement of the
night is no mean feat, signifying here, as would the "emblazoned zones
and fiery poles" of Wallace Stevens' "The Idea of Order at Key West,"
the human power to create, reshape, and organize.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
But Ridge has already begun to scrutinize the value of the tower's
rationalizing capacity through her use of "staring," which implies looking
without comprehension, judgment, or emotion. The building's authority
is challenged further through the "slip of a moon" that "at midnight,"
the moment of the tower's greatest aggrandizement, when even the hands
of its clock point straight upward, will "break another date" ("TSS,"
51). Even as the tower "breaks" (as in making publicly known) another
date in the passage of human time by recording the advent of midnight,
it is confounded by this timekeeper of a premodern era, which it can
only "ogle" fruitlessly. Ridge here begins a mischievous pursuit of the
phallic implications of the tall thin tower&#8212;ever erect yet never
satisfactorily coupled&#8212;revealing the anxieties of the patriarchal
imagination and the powermongering that emerges from them.

<p>
As if overcompensating for its inability to get satisfaction from
the moon, the tower embraces and proclaims its own <i>business</i>,
in two senses of the word. The skyscraper is all about doing business,
of course; but the "fuss" and clutter Ridge associates with it undermine
its ostensible rationalist precision. The ever-multiplying "ant-black
res" also do double duty, as both the dark-suited professionals
working in the building, rendered nearly microscopic by its enormity;
and as the numbers in the ledger books that record the business these
workers do. Calling the building a "flight of ledger books" ingeniously
mirrors its arrayed material components&#8212;such as flights of stairs,
banks of elevators, rows of desks and files&#8212;with the columns
of res, human and financial, that inhabit it. (<a name="8"
HREF="10.1newcomb_res.html#8"> 8</a>) That these flights
are "overrun" by the ant-black res again emphasizes the hectic
and uncontrolled&#8212;ultimately irrational&#8212;character of the
building's business, a critique given further force by Ridge's imagery of
dancing. The tower's "can-can" insistently asserts the can-do rationalism
that creates such buildings, but this frenetic dance ultimately succeeds
mostly in revealing the inadequacies

<b></b>

of that ideology. The ant-black human res are set dancing by their
compulsive need to conduct business, to make the res in their ledgers
leap, expand, and multiply. But the interminability of the dance implies
that it becomes its own end, with no goal or reward outside itself. The
fact that the res, both human and numerical, are "dancing on spindle
legs," offers little assurance of their ability to sustain their hectic
routine. The spindle is yet another intriguing image in this rich
passage. "Spindle legs" evoke the malnourishment, certainly spiritual
but possibly physical as well, of the tower's human population. Equated
with the numeric res in their ledgers, the humans are metaphorically
reduced to stick-res, their limbs but spindly pen-strokes.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
A spindle is also a literal piece of office equipment, a spike resting
on a desk on which stacks of papers are impaled. This is a suggestive
shape indeed in a poem about a very tall, very thin tower with a pointed
top. But while the tower may remind us of a huge spindle, the main
impact of this signification is to complete the ironic inversion of
its phallic power, since the function of a spindle would be to impale
forcibly the paper res kept within the tower, and by extension,
its human res as well. These images convey us to a vision, at once
sinister and whimsical, of the spindle-tower, striving obsessively upward
but failing to achieve any cosmic intercourse with the moon, succeeding
instead only in skewering its human creators, who may imagine themselves
as partaking in its power to penetrate, but who actually are penetrated
by it. Already reduced to the stature of insects in their "ant-black,"
these movers and shakers become the moved and shaken, subtler versions
of Eliot's image in "Prufrock" of modern-subject-as-insect, "pinned and
wriggling on the wall."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
The office spindle is a tool, rather an elemental one, for assembling,
organizing, and recording information; thus the image can also be
linked to the poem's controlling metaphor of the tower as a measuring
and recording device. It is to this conceit that Ridge turns again in the
final five lines, unfavorably evaluating the tower in contrast to the more
appealing if less exact method of counting time by the moonbeams that
filter between the walls of her building. Embracing the nonpatriarchal
and marginal values represented by the moon, the alley cats, and the
horizontal curves of her "stoop-shouldered walls," the poet playfully
presents the tower as grotesque in its enormity, rigid in its stability,
obsessive in its precision, ridiculous as it ticks mechanically away among
its celestial neighbors: ultimately, the emblem of a narrow capitalist
patriarchy whose only response to sunsets is to "tally" them ("TSS,"
51). The tally, like the notch and the spindle, is a rich term here,
again implying both spatial shape and temporal activity. A tally is a
stick on which notches are made to keep a record or count of something,
particularly a debt or payment. The tower, therefore, not only keeps
a tally but is itself a tally, attempting to notch the night and the
sunset, but instead mainly recording the interminable, empty business
of its own ledgers.

<p>
In exploring the confluence among assertions of patriarchal power,
anxieties of male sexual potency, and ideologies of capitalist aspiration,
Ridge has thoroughly ironized the skyscraper's symbolic function. Yet
the exuberance and wit of this critique suggests that in spite of her
critical gaze, she appreciates the tower for challenging and energizing
her creative powers. "Time-Stone" epitomizes a modernist poetics that
eschews a world elsewhere to participate wholeheartedly in the world of
urban-industrial modernity. More broadly, the fact that poets as divergent
in style and politics as Giovannitti, Teasdale, the Ben&eacute;ts, Wylie,
and Ridge were all drawn to write about the Metropolitan Tower testifies
to the depth and complexity of the skyscraper's imaginative power,
its capacity to signify the varied elements of modern experience. More
broadly still, these skyscraper poems demonstrate something too often
overlooked: the American modernist poet's rich and complex engagement
with the defining symbolic forms of twentieth-century modernity. Many of
the texts I mention here, such as Teasdale's "From the Woolworth Tower"
and William Rose Ben&eacute;t's "The Singing Skyscrapers," belong to an
important category of poems often dismissed as conventional because they
lack the referential opacity and emotional reserve that high-modernist
canons demanded. These poems combine a fascination with urban modernity,
and a willingness to explore innovative modes of verbal representation,
with the rhapsodic tonalities of nineteenth-century Romanticism. On the
other hand, of the neglected poems I discuss, the most conventionally
modernist in style, Ridge's "Time-Stone," seems as witty, opaque, ironic
as any New Critic might wish. Yet because it emerged out of a forceful
leftist engagement with modernity, it could not be accommodated within
the interpretive and ideological paradigms of New Criticism. I propose
that poetic modernism is, or should be, sufficiently capacious to take
all these poems as seriously as the works of Pound, Eliot, Stevens,
or Moore. From seventy years of formalist criticism we have inherited
impressive interpretive tools for modernist poetry. Now, in a postmodern
academic climate that relishes contradiction and eclecticism, suspects

<b></b>

moroseness, resists master-narratives, and yet demands some degree of
sociohistorical engagement, we need to adapt these tools to recovering
the many ways American poets articulated the complex, often contradictory
experiences that made modernity what it was, and is.

In the past few years, the field of modernist studies has been revivified
by scholarship that combines formalist and historicist techniques to
resituate modernist texts into the conditions of cultural modernity. Miles
Orvell's <i>The Real Thing: Imitation and Authenticity in American
Culture, 1880-1940</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,
1989), Martha Banta's <i>Taylored Lives: Narrative Productions in the Age
of Taylor, Veblen, and Ford</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1993), Bill Brown's <i>The Material Unconscious: American Amusement,
Stephen Crane, and the Economies of Play</i> (Cambridge: Harvard
University Press, 1997), and Michael Brooks's <i>Subway City: Riding the
Trains, Reading New York</i> (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press,
1997) are but a few of the excellent contributions to this campaign. But
so far only a few pioneering studies have begun to apply historicist
methods to modern American poetry, and to show that verse texts, both
canonical and unknown, can offer powerful new insights when we put
the modernism back into modernity, and vice versa. See Cary Nelson's
<i>Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of
Cultural Memory, 1910-1945</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press,
1989) and <i>Revolutionary Memory: Recovering the Poetry of the American
Left</i> (New York: Routledge, 2001), Alan Golding's <i>From Outlaw to

his own microscopic insignificance: "The very mass of it bore down upon

Baker, "TMS," 58. The skyscraper's distinctive combination of endless
variety and hermetic self-containment was also captured in this 1903
comment: "From the time these men enter their offices in the morning until
they go at night, many of them need not leave the building. Messenger
boys rush in and out with messages. By telegraph, cable, and telephone,
they can talk with London, San Francisco, or Fiftieth Street, as
they wish. Supplies are there, the restaurant is there, their barber,
their newspaper, their bank, their insurance company, their own police
and detective service, their own fire department, their broker, their
lawyer. It is a complete community in itself" (Goodrich, "BOAOB," 2968).

Though some discussion of the ruins of the Anasazi Cliff Dwellers
had appeared in obscure publications in the mid-1870s, it was
not until 1888 that the largest settlements were discovered by the
archaeological community (see Watson Smith, "Introduction," in Gustav
N&ouml;rdensk&iuml;old, <i>The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde</i>,
transl. D. Lloyd Morgan (New York: AMS Press, 1893; 1973), xi. The first
widely-circulated print accounts came just as the building of steel-frame
skyscrapers accelerated. As well as Nordenski&ouml;ld's ethnographic
study, see Frederick Chapin's book <i>The Land of the Cliff Dwellers</i>
(Boston: Appalachian Mountain Club / W. B. Clarke, 1892).

<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
Some accounts of the Cliff Dwellers used ethnocentric or openly racist
premises to account for their technological aptitude, refusing to
believe they could be the ancestors of the agrarian Pueblo peoples who
lived in the plains below, insisting that they must instead have been a
"lost fragment of Egyptian civilization," or even a "white people" of
"a prehistoric age" (see Joseph Munk, <i>Arizona Sketches</i> [New York:
Grafton Press, 1905], 171).

This model of the skyscraper as an insular microcosm combining futuristic
and ancient elements descends from the Cliff Dwellers metaphor down into
postmodern science-fiction, most vividly in Ridley Scott's dystopian
<i>Blade Runner</i>, where both the panoptical headquarters of the
monolithic Tyrell Corporation and the protagonist's fortresslike
apartment block feature design motifs reminiscent of Egyptian or
Amerindian cultures.

Stapley, "The City of Towers," 706. The sheer vertical wall, extending
to the property line and rising straight up, was the architectural
principle that made lower Manhattan's ca&ntilde;on streets so dark and
cheerless. Almost two decades of debate culminated in furor over the
notoriously monolithic Equitable Building, which was originally conceived
to rise 909 feet straight up. When completed in 1915 it had been reduced
to 542 feet, but still occupied virtually its entire one-acre lot all
the way to the top, "casting a noonday shadow four blocks long and
six times its own size" (see Sarah Bradford Landau and Carl Condit,
<i>The Rise of the New York Skyscraper 1865-1913</i> [New Haven: Yale
University Press], 394; henceforth abbreviated to <i>RNYS</i>). In 1916,
New York enacted zoning restrictions that restricted such sheer vertical
walls in tall buildings and mandated setback designs. Though the setback
debate was often framed in aesthetic, moral, and even medical terms,
the driving force behind

<b></b>

these restrictions was economic, as by 1910 it was clear that buildings
like the Equitable could have catastrophic effects on the value of
properties in their perpetual shadows, since few wanted to rent space
that offered no direct sunlight and little fresh air.

economic incentives, they do not fully explain the race into the skies,
which bespoke a deep psychic need for physical signs of the United
States' supremacy as a modernized nation. In pursuing this argument,
Ann Douglas ingeniously situates the skyscraper's "commodification of
the air as a marketable product" within the larger modernist category
of "airmindedness," which includes plane flight and broadcasting (see

The building's interior designer (no doubt unintentionally) invited
this sort of response from the skeptical with a grotesque corbel in
the southeast corner of the lobby that depicted the highest priest of
low lucre, F. W. Woolworth himself, counting nickels and dimes. Wolff's
condemnation of this monument to filthy lucre was particularly ironic
given that, almost uniquely among early skyscrapers, the Woolworth was
built and paid for in cash with no mortgage. Thomas van Leeuwen remarks
of this, "The building was conceived . . . as a memorial to the means by
which its owner had assembled his fortune, namely nickels and dimes, the
'atomic elements' of capitalism. But it also represented Woolworth's
preparations for the hereafter: the money was being returned to the
public in the form of a building that was without the sin of usury"
(van Leeuwen, <i>The Skyward Trend of Thought</i>, 67-68). Clearly,
Wolff was not impressed with this stratagem.

in wind, but their relative stability was one of the features of the
new buildings that most astonished people in the 1900s and 1910s. It
was claimed that the Woolworth Building was capable of withstanding
hypothetical winds of 200 M.P.H. without structural damage (see
<i>COC</i>, 27); in January 1913, three months before its dedication,
it did withstand gusts of 90 miles an hour with no damage (see Landau
and Condit, <i>RNYS</i>, 359). Of course, Holley is wrong too about the
skyscraper's inability to house birds.

<p>
<a name="FOOT44" href="#REF44">44</a>.
Holley, "Skyscraper," 22. William Rose Ben&eacute;t's "The Singing
Skyscrapers"  also offers a hallucinatory response to the
contemporary skyscraper, though Ben&eacute;t's apocalypse results in
a vision of celestial splendor. Half-awake, half-dreaming, the speaker
invokes by name the city's "tall titanic towers"&#8212; Metropolitan,
Flatiron, Singer, Woolworth&#8212;and imagines them "Singing in the air"
(see William Rose Ben&eacute;t, "The Singing Skyscraper," in <i>The
Burglar of the Zodiac</i>, [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1918],
1). These state-of-the-art modern buildings sing of vanished cities of the
past, which live on "Spectrally" in the human collective unconscious (as
"Majestic phantom cities that move above our slumber/Hung aloft in air"
[2]), and manifest themselves in the drive to build new cities, new
towers. The poet concludes that all such towers, from Nineveh to New
York, are attempts to put into material form a vision of a "Celestial
City/ Blinding in the sky!" (Ben&eacute;t, "The Singing Skyscraper,"
5). "The Singing Skyscrapers" is a fascinating, if uneven, attempt to
update a key mode of Romantic poetry, the rhapsodic spiritual epiphany,
into an ultramodern urban setting.

<p>
<a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>.
To New Yorkers of the 1910s, the Woolworth Building's twenty-eight
state-of-the-art elevators were objects of intense fascination: the
system was monitored from the lobby by an electric dispatcher mechanism,
while each car contained a phone capable of contacting any location
in the country, and enough safety cushions that a 7000 pound cargo was
once test-dropped in free-fall from the 45th floor to the bottom without
spilling a full glass of water in the car (<i>COC</i>, 14-15, 19). These
reassuring facts notwithstanding, Teasdale is mesmerized by the aura of
sublimity that the elevator achieves through its gravity-defying rate
of speed. In the 1910s, the two elevators going from the ground to the
observation deck in the Woolworth Building were the fastest in the world,
routinely running at 700 feet per minute (<i>COC</i>, 14).

In addition to the three poems mentioned above and the two discussed in
detail below, the Metropolitan Tower is a central element in Stephen
Vincent Ben&eacute;t's 1920 love lyric "Chanson at Madison Square"
(in Stephen Vincent Ben&eacute;t, <i>Heavens and Earth</i> [New York:
Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1920], 46). And although Robert Frost's
small masterpiece of modern alienation "Acquainted With the Night"
 refers to no specific buildings by name, I propose that many
early urbanite readers would almost certainly have thought of the
Metropolitan Tower upon encountering the poem's culminating image, "One
luminary clock against the sky" at an "unearthly height" (<i>The Poetry
of Robert Frost</i>, ed. Edward Connery Lathem [New York: Henry Holt,
1969], 255-56). The Metropolitan's famous electric-powered clock, its
illuminated faces three stories tall on all four sides of the building,
its minute hands weighing 1000 pounds each, was the largest in the
world. At more than 350 feet up, it was certainly the "unearthliest"
of all clocks of the era, visible from almost anywhere in the city.

<b></b>

Some have taken Frost's luminary clock as a clock, others as the moon. To
me it seems clear that both readings are fully available; clock and
moon merge in a modern cityscape so alienating that traditional natural
and modern technological measures of value are equally dysfunctional,
proclaiming only their own lack of meaning, and rendering time itself
"neither wrong nor right" (Frost, "Acquainted with the Night," 256).

A 1914 guidebook describes the illumination of the building's clock
and tower most fully: "As the evening darkness draws near, at any
predetermined hour for which the mechanism may be adjusted, hundreds
of electric lights appear back of the dial numerals, all of which
are brilliantly illuminated with splendid effect&#8212;a feature
never produced by any other clock in the world. Simultaneously with
the illumination of the hands and dials, an automatically actuated
switch lights up a great electric octagonal lantern, eight feet in
diameter, located at the top of the tower, from which powerful electric
flash-lights, marking the hours in the evening, may be seen for a great
distance, far beyond any possible transmission of sound, the time being
signalled therefrom as follows: Each of the quarter-hours is flashed in
red and the hours in white light&#8212;one red flash for the quarter,
two red flashes for the half, three red flashes for three-quarters, and
four red flashes for the even hour&#8212;these latter flashes followed
by a number of white flashes marking the hour" (<i>MLIC</i>, 48). As
of the spring of 2001, the refurbished Metropolitan Tower was again
offering a nightly light show; but the current effects, which involve
a continuous series of gradual color changes on the top levels of the
building, do not create a flashlight effect, nor do they measure time
as the original ones did. The tower's great illuminated clock still runs.

A Response to Ronald Schuchard
<!--_/title-->
</h2>

<p>
The name Anthony Julius is nowhere mentioned in Ronald Schuchard's
richly informative essay, but clearly the author of <i>T. S. Eliot,
Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form</i> (1995, second edition forthcoming)
was on Schuchard's mind as he assembled his brief in defense of
the poet against the charge of anti-Semitism&#8212;a charge not
original with Julius, of course, but made most forcefully by him. In
countering the Julius line, Schuchard mounts two arguments. The first,
on pages 7-11, carefully contextualizes the "offensive" poems of the
late 1910s&#8212;e.g.,"Burbank with a Baedeker," "Sweeney among the
Nightingales," and "Gerontion"&#8212;so as to show that the "dominant
motive" of these poems was not to "exercise a little gratuitous
anti-Semitism"  but to dramatize the sense of despair and failure
of Eliot's war years&#8212;a phantasmagoria in which the poet's own
consciousness is at one with that of his characters. The second argument
(11-21) concerns, not Eliot the youthful poet, but Eliot the Public Man
and Social-Cultural Presence of the post-conversion years, especially
on his now frequent visits to the United States.

<p>
Here, I shall not take up Schuchard's first argument since I have myself
recently countered Julius along somewhat similar lines. In my T. S. Eliot
Memorial Lecture (September 2002), I suggest that the notorious passage
in "Gerontion" ("the jew squats on the window sill, the owner. . ."),
obviously anti-Semitic as it appears when taken out of context, must
be understood within the frame of the entire poem, which expresses, in
the most moving and terrifying terms possible, the crisis ("After such
knowledge, what forgiveness?") Eliot underwent in the years following
the death of his beloved Jean Verdenal, <i>mort aux Dardanelles</i>
in 1915, his miserable marriage to Vivien, coupled with his knowledge

<b></b>

of and complicity in her sordid affair with Bertrand Russell, and the
sudden death in 1919 of his father, with whom he had not had a chance
to reconcile and who was never to know that his son was to become a
distinguished poet.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Schuchard establishes a careful factual context for "Burbank with a
 Baedeker," and although I disagree with some of his particulars&#8212;I
 think, for example, that Eliot's alleged concern for post-war Vienna was
 hardly, as Schuchard thinks , a case of empathy for the displaced
 Eastern Jews pouring into that city but, on the contrary, a concern
 that the great imperial capital would be mongrelized and its vibrant
 culture destroyed&#8212;I am sympathetic to the argument for context
 that Schuchard makes.

<p>
But the second half of the essay is more troubling. Here, the focus is
on Eliot's relationship with the Jewish social philosopher, Zionist, and
New School of Social Research professor Horace N. Kallen, an intellectual
whom Eliot first met at Harvard in 1906, and whose (hitherto unknown)
correspondence with the poet has now surfaced at the Jacob Rader Marcus
Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, Ohio. This cache
of letters&#8212;they extend from 1927 to 1960 and, as Schuchard points
out, more and earlier letters may well surface since the two men had
been close friends at Harvard from 1906 to 1911&#8212;does indeed, in
Schuchard's words "restore a missing chapter of American cultural history"
. The question is what that missing chapter tells us.

<p>
From 1927 on, when his "friendly correspondence" with Eliot resumed,
Kallen was evidently making "repeated efforts to bring [the poet]
to the [New School] to lecture and read, an arrangement that finally
materialized in the spring of 1933 when Eliot was Norton Professor at
Harvard" . Kallen was a fervent admirer of the Great Poet and was
hence honored to entertain him. At the dinner party he hosted for Eliot at
a New York restaurant, one of the guests was the Supreme Court Justice
Benjamin Cardozo. Eliot was apparently much impressed with Cardozo,
writing to his producer Henry Sherek that the Justice was "singularly
distinguished amongst all the guests," and that "I have always been
attracted by Sephardim" .

<p>
Schuchard takes such anecdotes&#8212;and he gives a number of
them&#8212;as evidence of Eliot's cordial feeling toward Jews. But
why shouldn't Eliot have been pleased to meet someone as distinguished
and famous as Cardozo? And even then, he cannot seem to take Cardozo's
accomplishments at face value: they must be related to the Chief Justice's
Sephardic origins. As for Horace Kallen himself, why wouldn't Eliot be
pleased and flattered by the fuss Kallen, obviously a man of independent
means, made about him whenever he visited New York? Kallen, after all,
was not just any Jew but a well-situated Harvard Jew who had demonstrated
his intellectual distinction. A Jew, moreover, who despite friendly
debates with Eliot on issues of religion and culture, seems never to
have voiced the slightest objection to the poet's words or actions.

<p>
The delightful visit with Kallen, in any case, coincided with the
preparation and delivery of the Page-Barbour Lectures delivered at the
University of Virginia in April-May 1933 and published in 1934 under
the title <i>After Strange Gods</i><i>.</i> It is here, of course, that
Eliot made his notorious statement that "reasons of race and religion
combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable." "This
unfortunate

<b></b>

statement," writes Schuchard, "one of the most quoted and disdained in
modern literary and cultural studies, has pained many readers of Eliot,
including myself, and my purpose in bringing it forward again is not
to excuse it but to reconstruct a context that shows that it is not,
regardless of its appearance, an anti-Semitic statement; it is an anti
free-thinking statement" . Here, Schuchard follows Cleanth Brooks,
who declared in 1985 that "<i>free-thinking</i> [not Jews] is the key
phrase. Thus, even the ultra-conservative Old South got along with its
God-fearing Jews very well. There was perhaps less anti-Jewish feeling
in the Old South than anywhere else in the United States" (25, n.50).

<p>
As a "free-thinking" Jew married to a free-thinking Jew brought up
in the Old South (New Orleans) I have always found Brooks's statement
offensive. Who is Eliot, who is Brooks, to tell Jews that they should or
should not be "free-thinking"? That as long as they were "God-fearing"
they were acceptable in the Old South? For one thing, it isn't true:
Jews in New Orleans, for example, whether secular or religious, were
(and still are) excluded from all Mardi Gras activities which were,
in Brooks's day, at the very heart of the social and commercial life
of the city. But even if this were not the case, Brooks's remark, which
Schuchard endorses, is irritatingly patronizing, as if to say, we really
like those darkies down here as long as they know their place. Who,
after all, was telling the Christian majority in the Old South what they
should or should not believe?

<p>
Eliot's statement evidently cost him a number of friendships, including
that of the (Jewish) philosopher Franz Boas, who, Eliot told Kallen,
had been his closest friend in graduate school , and it produced a
rift between the poet and his later friend Isaiah Berlin. In response
to Eliot's remark about not wanting free-thinking Jews about, Boas
evidently wrote him, "I can at least rid you of the company of one"
(25, n.53). There is no record of a reply, but to Berlin, Eliot wrote
in 1951 that "the sentence of which you complain (with justice) <i>would
of course never have appeared at all at that time if I had been aware of
what was going to happen, indeed had already begun, in Germany</i><i>"</i>
(16, my emphasis)<i>.</i>

<p>
Schuchard takes this disclaimer at face value, noting that Eliot may
well have had in mind the "free-thinking humanism" of his friend Kallen
(whom he admired despite the aberration of his secularism), and he adds,
"though Kallen and Eliot never discuss the episode in their letters,
Kallen would certainly have understood Eliot's intention in relation to
their own dialogue on the relation of culture, humanism, and religion; it
certainly had no effect on their friendship" . But the fact is that
Kallen should have objected. For Eliot's claim that he had been unaware
"of what was going to happen, indeed had already begun, in Germany,"
strikes me as quite disingenuous. Here a few dates and facts may help
clarify the situation.

<p>
Hitler came to power in January 1933, at the very time Eliot was beginning
work on his Page-Barbour Lectures, which were delivered in April of that
year. Within weeks, all Jewish civil servants were dismissed as were all
Jewish university professors and school teachers. The number of Jewish
students at German schools and universities was rigidly curtailed. Jews
were quickly dismissed from the press, the broadcasting industry,
and the arts. By 1 April, a large-scale state boycott of Jewish stores
and businesses

<b></b>

was introduced; armed SS guards made an example of particular Jewish
shops to insure compliance with the ban. On 10 May, 1933, a public
burning of Jewish and anti-Nazi books took place throughout Germany,
anticipating the<i>Kristallnacht</i> of 1938. By July 1933, Germany had
passed a law for forced sterilization of those with "genetic" defects
and all East European Jewish immigrants were stripped of their German
citizenship. By August, Jewish lawyers were forbidden to practice law
and Jewish doctors were allowed to treat only Jewish patients.

<p>
All this was done quite openly and was reported by the newspapers
throughout Europe and the U.S. In <i>Mein Kampf</i> , for that
matter, Hitler had made no bones about his intentions so far as the Jews
were concerned, and the minute he came to power, he began to carry them
out&#8212;in the form of public edicts and laws. Indeed, in the United
States, protest on the part of American Jews was quick to come: in the
spring of 1933, anti-Nazi rallies took place at Madison Square Garden,
demanding a boycott of trade with Germany.

<p>
What then does Eliot mean when he says he didn't know what was happening
in Germany? If he read the newspapers at all, he did "know." And even
if he didn't "know" in the spring of 1933, what about the interval
between delivery of the lectures and their publication by Faber &amp;
Faber in 1934? Eliot could easily have expunged the offending sentence
from <i>After Strange Gods</i>. Or could he? Here is the whole paragraph
in which it is embedded:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
You are hardly likely to develop tradition except where the bulk of the
population is relatively so well off where it is that it has no incentive
or pressure to move about. The population should be homogeneous; where
two or more cultures exist in the same place they are likely either to
be fiercely self-conscious or both to become adulterate. What is still
more important is unity of religious background; and reasons of race
and religion combine to make any large numbers of free-thinking Jews
undesirable. There must be a proper balance between urban and rural,
industrial and agricultural development. And a spirit of excessive
tolerance is to be deprecated.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In the context of what was already happening in Germany, the demand for
cultural and religious homogeneity and the caution against tolerance
put the notorious sentence about "free-thinking Jews" in an especially
negative light. Eliot, who later confided to various friends that the
word he especially regretted in the passage was <i>race</i>,never
reprinted <i>After Strange Gods</i>. In the years that followed,
no doubt feeling somewhat guilty, he worked with Kallen to help
Jewish refugee professors&#8212;for example Karl Mannheim and Adolph
L&ouml;we&#8212;obtain jobs in the U.S. and he participated in a group
called Moot, organized in 1938 to discuss social and political issues
and, later, to plan for national reconstruction . But are such
activities different in kind from the help Ezra Pound offered to Louis
Zukofsky over the years? Indeed, in many ways Pound was more generous
than Eliot: strapped for funds himself, he paid Zukofsky's way when the
latter came to visit him in Rapallo in the mid-twenties. Pound could
forgive Jewishness in poets whose work he admired just as Eliot could
forgive it in highly cultured educated men. Both cases are no more than
variants on "Some of my best friends are Jews."

<b></b>

<p>
There is no indication that the basic views formulated in <i>After
Strange Gods</i> ever changed. Schuchard cites a commentary Eliot
wrote for the <i>Christian News-Letter</i> in 1941, protesting
the Vichy government's anti-Semitic policies, as evidence of the
poet's firm objection to anti-Semitism. But this protest is at best
equivocal. "Anti-Semitism," writes Eliot, "there has always been among
the parties of the extreme Right: but it was a very different thing, as
a symptom of the disorder of French society and politics for the last
hundred and fifty years, from what it is when it takes its place as a
principle of reconstruction." . The implication of this statement is
that anti-Semitism is natural, perhaps even inevitable, when government
is not sufficiently in control, as was the case in France throughout
the twenties and thirties, but that when it is codified as law, it goes
too far. Eliot does not seem to understand that the second step follows
logically from the first.

<p>
However warmly Eliot may have felt about this or that Jewish friend or
acquaintance, Schuchard's researches reveal that for the poet, Jews remain
Jews first, individuals later. In 1947, for example, Eliot protested
to the poet Edward Field, who had accused him of being anti-Semitic,
"I am no more anti-semitic [sic] than I am anti-Welsh or anti-Eskimo"
. This is, of course, the ultimate put-down since Eliot hardly
numbered many Eskimos among his acquaintance or among those cultivated
Western Christians he admired. Like the wild Welsh and the exotic Eskimos,
Jews remain outsiders for Eliot&#8212;people one tolerates (and sometimes
even befriends) but whom one can't quite accommodate into <i>The Idea
of a Christian Society</i> . And there the matter stood even if
Eliot admired the poetry of Isaac Rosenberg or the social philosophy of
his friend Horace Kallen.

<p>
Indeed, Eliot's later cultural pronouncements provide an interesting gloss
on his earlier poetry. I would myself argue that the overtly nasty slurs
on Jews in <i>Poems 1920</i> are much less offensive than the "humane"
position adopted by Eliot the sixty-year old smiling public man. For that
younger poet was much less given to holding "views" than to putting his
<i>feelings</i> into his poetry. From "Prufrock" to <i>The Waste Land</i>,
Eliot's poetry is nasty, cruel, painful&#8212;and utterly charismatic,
no doubt because the poet is just as hard on himself as he is on those
hated others, "Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London." It
is the poet as Gerontion, after all, who "was neither at the hot gates/
Nor fought in the warm rain/ Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a
cutlass,/ Bitten by flies, fought." The verb "fought" in that last line
is almost spit out in a moment of self-disgust.

<p>
"Gerontion" and <i>The Waste Land</i> will always attract readers because
of their sheer verbal and conceptual brilliance. The poetic fabric, in
these cases, has absorbed the ideological residue. Ironically, it is not
the fiery, nasty younger Eliot but the genteel and understanding Public
Poet of the later years that is the problem&#8212;the poet who writes
those self-deprecating lines in "East Coker" about "Twenty years largely
wasted," since his every poetic attempt has been "a different kind of
failure," even as he declares that an "ideal Christian culture "can"
accommodate Jewish religion and culture"&#8212;provided, of course,
that, as Eliot wrote the Jewish publisher Victor Gollancz, Jews be
"devout and practicing" .

<b></b>

<p>
"At the end of the culture war," Schuchard concludes, "Eliot, tired of
conducting conflicts with secular humanists in no man's land, warmly
welcomed followers of the Jewish religion into his idea of a Christian
society" . Provided, of course, they <i>followed</i>the religion. For
many of us, there is nothing "warm" about this exclusionary gesture.

<p>
T. S. Eliot arrived in London by mischance in August 1914, forced here
by the German declaration of war, just as he had begun his study of
German philosophy at the University of Marburg. He would have preferred
a landing in Paris, where he had spent an earlier academic year at the
Sorbonne; he was being trained in the mind of Europe at Harvard, and his
previous travels, especially in Italy, had further shaped his European
sensibility. In the growing cultural chaos, however, an uncertain route
to England became his one, fortuitous avenue of escape. He took refuge
in Merton College and began reading philosophy to fulfill the spirit of
his travelling fellowship. At the end of the year, he took the first
step of self-imposed exile&#8212;his unannounced marriage to Vivien
Haigh Wood&#8212;and briefly returned alone to the family summer home in
Gloucester, Massachusetts, to inform his parents that he was abandoning
a career in philosophy at Harvard for a literary career in London. After
suffering a withering rebuke, he agreed that the precipitous cancellation
of his fellowship was one of his "blunders" and duly promised to complete
his doctoral dissertation.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Upon his safe and permanent return to London, where Vivien had been
 left in the care and company of Bertrand Russell, Eliot began to unpack
 the intellectual baggage that he brought to England from America:
 a few respected authors (Poe, Hawthorne, Henry James), his masters
 at Harvard (Josiah Royce and Irving Babbitt), those he needed to set
 himself up as a practicing poet and literary critic



and to exercise an almost intact vision of culture and its relation to
humanism and religion. Others have examined the importance of Eliot's
American luggage in England, but much has remained lost in the attic. So I
want to spend an hour rummaging in Eliot's attic, tracing his definition
and defense of culture in relation to some American intellectuals with
opposing ideas of culture. In the process, I feel obliged to address
the widespread presumption that his writings are anti-Semitic, first by
reconstructing the lost contexts of "Burbank with a Baedeker" and "Dirge"
and  <i>After Strange Gods</i>, and then by bringing out of the attic a
fugitive intellectual whose relationship to Eliot may radically reform
our perception of Eliot as a critic of Judaeo-Christian culture in Europe.

<p>
The first re that Eliot removed from his steamer trunk was Ralph
Waldo Emerson, Unitarian minister, Transcendentalist philosopher,
champion of the democratic spirit, and hero of nineteenth-century
American literature and culture. Eliot's grandfather, the Unitarian
preacher William Greenleaf Eliot, had met Emerson; his mother and members
of his extended St. Louis and Boston families revered him; but to Eliot
he was the romantic embodiment of everything he wanted to exile himself
from in America&#8212;religious liberalism, individualism, optimism,
sentimentalism. In Eliot's view, the Emersonian-Unitarian philosophy had
infected his family and the whole of New England, particularly Boston,
and especially Harvard University; it had led to "the Boston doubt," a
scepticism, he wrote "which is difficult to explain to those who are not
born to it. This scepticism is a product, or a cause, or a concomitant,
of Unitarianism; it is not destructive, but it is dissolvent."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Emerson's Unitarian virus, working on a weakened strain of New England
 Puritanism, had transformed itself into Transcendentalism, and a young
 Eliot found the blanched, dissolvent morality abhorrent. "In the Puritan
 morality that I remember," he wrote, "it was tacitly assumed that if
 one was thrifty, enterprising, intelligent, practical and prudent
 in not violating social conventions, one ought to have a happy and
 'successful' life. Failure was due to some weakness or perversity
 peculiar to the individual; but the decent man need have no nightmares."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The new London resident and bridegroom was equally concerned that
Emerson's philosophy had worked its corrosive effects on the cultural
and social theories of English writers&#8212;Carlyle, Ruskin, Arnold,
and others. "I was brought up in an environment of that intellectual and
puritanical rationalism which is found in the novels of George Eliot,"
he wrote scornfully. "Herbert Spencer's generalized theory of evolution
was in my childhood environment regarded as the key to the mystery of
the universe."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Arnold, who had praised Emerson for his "holding fast to happiness and
 hope," was in Eliot's eyes the English Emerson, so in the late summer
 of 1915, when he began to amuse himself with poems satirical of Boston
 culture and its "modern" ideas, he could not resist the temptation to
 train his scathing satirical eye on the bookshelves of Cousin Nancy's
 sitting room:
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 "Upon the glazen shelves kept watch/ Matthew and Waldo, guardians of
 the faith,/ The army of unalterable law."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Already we see a severe cultural critic and caricaturist at work in his
 poems; in time, he would learn how to bring a more ferocious English
 humor to his caricature of cultural antagonists.

<p>
It should not be surprising, then, to discover that when Eliot began
teaching his three-year Extension course for the University of London
he regularly discussed three

<b></b>

of his Victorian subjects, Arnold, Carlyle, and Ruskin, in relation to
Emerson, comparing them as moralists and social reformers, contrasting
their attitudes toward Christianity, and assigning Arnold's <i>Culture
and Anarchy</i>, Ruskin's <i>Stones of Venice</i><i>,</i> Carlyle's
<i>Heroes and Hero Worship</i>.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 He also had his students read J. M. Robertson's <i>Modern Humanists:
 Sociological Studies of Carlyle, Mill, Emerson, Arnold, Ruskin and
 Spencer</i>,for the theme of Eliot's course was that of Robertson:
 these were false prophets of religion and culture.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 So central had Emerson become to Eliot's discussions of cultural
 theories that when he resumed the course for the second year he
 placed Emerson first on the syllabus, apprising his students of
 the religious and philosophical environment of New England, taking
 them through the tenets of Unitarianism and Transcendentalism, and
 extending the comparison with English social philosophers, who now
 included William Morris and Walter Pater. He had them read Emerson's
 <i>Essays</i><i>,</i> <i>Nature</i>, and <i>The Conduct of Life</i>,
 further directing them to Emerson's ten-volume <i>Journal</i> "to obtain
 a more intimate knowledge of the man" (<i>EDA</i>, 41, 43). Emerson
 had confusedly attempted to make man as much the measure of all
 things as God, so when Eliot came to draw his post-erectile portrait
 of Sweeney in "Sweeney Erect," he delighted in holding up Emerson's
 philosophy for a touch of comic ridicule: "(The lengthened shadow of
 a man/ Is history, said Emerson/ Who had not seen the silhouette/ Of
 Sweeney straddled in the sun)" (<i>CPP</i>, 26). Emerson's cohorts,
 such as Edward Tyrrell Channing, the Boylston Professor at Harvard,
 were also fair game for poetry, so when he wrote his priapic portrait
 of Bertrand Russell in "Mr. Apollinax," he included in the Boston tea
 party, in animal caricature, Professor and Mrs. "Channing-Cheetah"
 (<i>CPP</i>, 18). Comic and biting satire aside, the gravity of what
 Eliot was telling his students is evident in his review of a history
 of American literature in 1919: "Neither Emerson nor any of the others
 was a real observer of the moral life."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
The American philosophers who stood behind Eliot's criticism of
modern culture were Irving Babbitt and Josiah Royce, both of whom
formed the necessary antipode to Unitarianism and Jamesian pragmatism
at Harvard. Babbitt's anti-Rousseauistic, anti-humanitarian analysis of
the disintegration of western culture since the Renaissance, and Royce's
application of his absolute idealism to the problems of Christianity
in the modern world, had an intellectual impact on Eliot that even now
has not been fully estimated. With Babbitt he had followed literary and
intellectual traditions in France; it was Babbitt who sent him to the
Sorbonne, who taught him how to diagnose and attack the foundations of
secularism. With Royce he had explored philosophies of the absolute;
it was Royce who directed him to F. H. Bradley and who subsequently
judged his dissertation on Bradley's philosophy "the work of an expert"
(<i>L</i>, 142). Though an examination of their ideas of cultural
degeneration and reconstruction is beyond the scope of this essay,
the tenets and effects of their teaching are evident in Eliot's use
of Emerson, Arnold, and others as cultural straw men after he arrived
in London. In their shadows, Eliot had begun his rout of free-thinking
humanists in his new country. Toward his own reconstructive ends, the
American exile began moving as deliberately as possible, through the
<i>Egoist</i>, the <i>Athenaeum</i>, and eventually the <i>Criterion</i>,
to station himself at the center of English culture.

<b></b>

<p>
If Arnold's substitution of poetry for religion as a cultural stay had
become anathema to the young critic, he nonetheless kept at heart the
guiding concern of Arnold's <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>&#8212;the necessary
conjunction of Hebraic and Hellenic traditions in modern culture. Indeed,
as he formulated his idea of tradition and the "historical sense"
under the influence of Babbitt and Royce, he worked with a sharp
awareness of the major compounds of European history&#8212;Graeco-Roman,
Judaeo-Christian, Old-New Testament&#8212;and, as his poetry shows,
he had learned to read the map of Europe as a palimpsest of cultural
and religious change. Thus, his most exciting literary discovery
for representing cultural history in art came from his reading of the
Ireland-Israel odyssey of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, as chapters
of Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> began to appear in the <i>Little Review</i>
in the spring and summer of 1918. Not only the techniques and motifs, but
the crudity&#8212;"justified by exploitation to the point of greatness"
Eliot wrote&#8212;had an immediate impact on his own poetry.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 At the end of the summer, the <i>Little Review</i> published, together
 with the "Hades" chapter of <i>Ulysses</i>, four strikingly new
 poems by Eliot: "Dans Le Restaurant," where we suddenly encounter
 the striking image of a drowned Phoenician, the Semitic Phlebas;
 "Sweeney Among the Nightingales" and "Mr. Eliot's Sunday Morning
 Service," where we meet a crude new protagonist, Sweeney, moving from
 a menacing brothel scene to a Bloom-like contemplation in a bathtub of
 "the masters of the subtle schools"; and "Whispers of Immortality,"
 where the horrific sexual visions and dry-rib metaphysics of Webster
 and Donne are set against the sexual allurement and bosomy bliss
 promised by an exotic if not erotic Grishken. In succeeding months
 these poems would be followed by "Burbank with a Baedeker," "Sweeney
 Erect," and "Gerontion," poems in which a procession of European and
 American gentiles and Jews are paraded into a searing poetic light. To
 comprehend the dramatic change and new cast of characters we must
 look beyond Joyce to some devastating developments in Eliot's life:
 the discovery of Vivien's adultery with Russell at their shared cottage
 in Marlow and the mounting effects of the war.

<p>
Eliot had heard horrifying stories of the war from his nineteen-year-old
brother-in-law Maurice, who returned from the front in France to describe
the necessity of shooting rats in the trenches at night. "What he tells
about rats and vermin is incredible," Eliot reported to his mother,
"Northern France is swarming, and the rats are big as cats" (<i>L</i>,
121). When Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken in January 1916 about the death
of his Paris friend Jean Jules Verdenal in the Dardanelles, he and
Vivien had become "very blue about the war" (<i>L</i>, 125), and as
Eliot suffered further shocks and losses the effect on his sensibility
intensified. Less than a fortnight before Verdenal's death Rupert Brooke
had died in the Aegean. In March 1917, he wrote to his brother: "The
world seems a complete nightmare at times, nothing that could happen
would be surprising. I wonder if there will ever come a time when we
shall look back and find that the period we are living through seems
quite unreal in retrospect" (<i>L</i>, 172). "I have been living in one
of Dostoevsky's novels," he wrote to his cousin. "If I have not seen
the battle field, I have seen other strange things . . . it all seems
like a dream" (<i>L</i>, 189). By the spring of 1918, the unreality of
his betrayed marriage had intensified his nightmare and fuelled

<b></b>

his failed attempt to get a commission in Army or Navy Intelligence. "I
feel very old at present," he told his brother, "and mentally quite
exhausted" (<i>L</i>, 250), as if he were writing out of the persona of
"Gerontion," then in composition. In the midst of his psychological
exhaustion, Eliot suddenly began to transform the nightmare of his
life into an extended phantasmagoria in his art. Phlebas, Sweeney,
Rachel ne&eacute;Rabinovitch, the yet-to-be-named Mrs. Porter, and
Grishken were followed by a European gallery of ethnic highbrows and
lowlifes&#8212;Mr. Silvero, Madame de Tornquist, Hakagawa, Fr&auml;ulein
von Kulp, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, Doris, Burbank, Bleistein, Princess
Volupine, and all the rest. Several characters begin to move freely from
poem to poem as though we the readers must know them intimately: Phlebas,
Sweeney, Mrs. Porter, Fresca and Bleistein reappear in <i>The Waste
Land</i> or its canceled drafts, with Sweeney and Mrs. Porter casually
displacing Acteon and Diana as mythical counterparts in the Unreal
City. By then Eliot could draw on the phantasmal world of Joyce's "Circe"
for the original opening of the poem, and he extended the unreality
to <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i>, to the twilight kingdom of <i>The Hollow
Men</i>, and to the disconnected fragments of "Doris's Dream Songs."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 On an early draft of <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i> he appended from the
 letters of Junius an epigraph meant to characterize the fictional
 companions through whom he expressed his convictions about the world:
 "These are the companions of a disturbed imagination; the melancholy
 madness of poetry, without the inspiration."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
Meanwhile, in the real world at Lloyds Bank, under the pavement of
Lombard Street, Eliot's convictions were being trampled by the former
Professor/President of Princeton, now President Woodrow Wilson, who
was directing the peace process toward the Treaty of Versailles in
June 1919. He had approved of Wilson's policies during the war and
hoped that the Democratic party would survive long enough "to see the
satisfaction of the peace negotiations along Wilson lines" (<i>L</i>,
264). But as he worked on "Sweeney Erect," "Burbank," and "Gerontion,"
Eliot became utterly dismayed by the peace negotiations and believed
that the European powers took advantage of Wilson. It was "a bad peace,"
he told his mother. "And I believe that Wilson made a grave mistake in
coming to Europe" (<i>L</i>, 337). The Treaty became for Eliot a terribly
discouraging symbolic moment in the continuing dissolution of European
unity, in which he had invested life's blood. He was horrified by what
he saw happening to ethnic groups as territorial boundaries were redrawn
by the Treaty. Wilson's whole conception of a new world society governed
by the "self-determination of the peoples," was characterized, Eliot
believed, by Rousseauistic humanitarianism, Emersonian self-reliance,
American sentimentalism of the most naive kind. To Eliot, Wilson's idea of
peace was an idea which disregarded the <i>unity</i> of European culture,
an idea that foisted the excesses of religious liberalism and American
idealism on the nation-states of Europe. So strong was his criticism of
Wilson that he used him as an analogue in his sardonic literary criticism
of Vachel Lindsay, writing in his "London Letter" to the <i>Dial</i>
that Lindsay's "Y.M.C.A. morality represents something more remote
than a massacre in Armenia," and that though his verses have appeared
in an English periodical "I cannot believe that he is treated with
more respect than that with which Clemenceau and Lloyd George bonified
President Wilson."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
In August, desperate to get out of London, he broke away from the bank
in a state of emotional extremity to meet Pound in southern France for
a walking tour of the Dordogne, carrying with him the manuscript of
"Gerontion," whose persona is a haunted, Tiresias-like re who has
witnessed but not fought in all the wars, an exhausted persona lost
in the labyrinthine corridors of history, waiting for a redemptive
sign. The manuscript still carried a dropped epigraph from Dante's
<i>Inferno</i>, where Friar Albergio reveals that his soul is dead and
damned even though his body is alive on earth. When asked, "Are you
already dead?" he replies, "Just how my body is in the world above,
I have no way of knowing" (XXXIII, 122-23). As he gazed at the wave
pattern carved into a stone wall at the castle in Excidueil, Eliot
cried out in Pound's hearing, "I am afraid of the life after death,"
and in La Cath&eacute;dral Saint-Front in P&eacute;rigueux he suffered
the second vastation since learning of the infidelity in Marlow.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 "This sense of dispossession by the dead I have known twice," he later
 remarked of his state of mind, "at Marlow and at P&eacute;rigueux."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 After his return to the bank he immersed himself in John Maynard
 Keynes' <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> , in which
 Keynes, too, saw Wilson's temperament in Versailles as more that of a
 Presbyterian theocrat than that of a statesman&#8212;an "important book"
 Eliot told his mother (<i>L</i>, 353), as he began dealing with the war
 reparations dictated by the Treaty of Versailles. The consequences of
 the Treaty continued to prey upon his mind. "I hope it will not prevent
 America from helping in Central Europe," he wrote to her, especially
 mindful of the plight of thousands of Hasidic Jews who had migrated to
 Vienna to join the Jewish population there when Galicia and Bukovina
 were taken over by Russia and Rumania during the German surrender;
 "the destitution, especially the starvation in Vienna, appears to
 be unspeakable. I suppose Americans realise now what a fiasco the
 reorganisation of nationalities has been: the 'Balkanisation' of
 Europe" (<i>L</i>, 351). The revenge-seeking Succession States of
 the Austro-Hungarian Empire had severely restricted food shipments
 to the once-imperial city. A fortnight later he wrote to her again:
 "The American professors must be having a very bad time. I wonder if
 America realises how terrible the condition of central Europe is. I
 can never quite put Vienna out of my mind. And I have seen people who
 have been in Germany and they are most pessimistic about the future,
 not only of Germany, but of the world. They say that there is no hope
 unless the treaty is revised" (<i>L</i>, 353).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
In worsening health, Eliot turned his disturbed poetic faculties to
<i>The Waste Land</i>and his nightmare vision of the "Falling towers"
of European civilization: "Jerusalem Athens Alexandria/ Vienna London/
Unreal" (<i>CPP</i>, 48). When E. M. Foster astutely reviewed the poem as
one of extraordinary horror brought on by the war, Eliot wrote to him with
a Gerontion-like guilt over his non-participation: "You are right about
the 'horror' . . . I only think that you exaggerate the importance of the
War in this context. The War crippled me as it did everyone else; but me
chiefly because it was something I was neither honestly in nor honestly
out of, but the Waste Land might have been just the same without the War."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 What Forster had not seen was that the poem was also driven by the
 "cauldron of unholy loves" (<i>CPP</i>, 53) that had fired his poems
 since 1918.

<p>
So I return to the heart of Eliot's phantasma in 1919, the worst year
of his life,

<b></b>

though in May he took some pleasure in Leonard Woolf's publication
of the <i>Little Review</i> poemsat the Hogarth Press. Eliot had read
the poems to the Woolfs the previous autumn before sending copies for
consideration. To Virginia, the meaning of the difficult poems had to
be dragged up from "the depths of silence."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Since its initial appearance in the <i>Little Review</i>, "Sweeney
 Among the Nightingales" had been given a new, short-lived epigraph
 ("Why should I speak of the nightingale?/ The nightingale sings of
 adulterous wrong").
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 He had placed two new poems,"Burbank with a Baedeker" and
 "Sweeney Erect," with Sidney Schiff, literary editor of <i>Art and
 Letters</i><i>,</i> and he was making arrangements with his friend
 John Rodker, who had succeeded Pound as literary editor of the
 <i>Little Review</i>, to bring out a collection of his poems at
 Rodker's Ovid Press<i>.</i> Toward that prospect, he sent Rodker
 "Burbank," "Sweeney Erect," and "Ode," for his commentary. Let us
 remember who these men were as we move around Eliot's attic. Both
 Rodker and Schiff were members of an Anglo-Jewish community of writers
 and artists that included Jacob Isaacs, Mark Gertler, Ada Leverson,
 and others in East London and Bloomsbury circles, and the Eliots moved
 in their company. Isaacs, an admiring critic of Eliot's work and his
 companion at the music halls, wrote that "if I have done nothing else
 for literature, I did at least take Mr. Eliot to see Mr. Ernie Lotinga
 at the Islington Empire."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Both Rodker and Schiff had introduced Eliot to the poems of Isaac
 Rosenberg, who had fallen at the Somme the previous April. When Rodker
 announced the death of the twenty-seven-year old poet in the <i>Little
 Review,</i>he described it as "a greater loss to poetry in this country
 than any death during the war."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Schiff would feature Rosenberg and Eliot together in the summer issue
 of <i>Art and Letters</i>, publishing five of Rosenberg's poems,
 a drawing, and his sister's obituary on the pages preceding Eliot's
 "Burbank" and "Sweeney Erect," and Eliot was ever after a champion of
 Rosenberg's poems.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Eliot then sent drafts of "Gerontion" to Rodker and Schiff, asking
 for their candid opinions. "I am appreciative of your careful study
 of 'Gerontion,'" Eliot wrote in reply to Schiff, thanking him for
 his commentary, "and shall be glad always to hear anything further
 you may have to say about it" (<i>L</i>, 324)<i>.</i> "'Bleistein,'"
 he told Mary Hutchinson, "(like 'S[weeney] among the Nightingales')
 is meant to be <i>veryserious</i>!"(<i>L</i>, 311), an emphasis he
 reiterated to his brother when Rodker published the poems in <i>Ara
 Vos Prec</i>: "Some of the new poems, the Sweeney ones, especially
 'Among the Nightingales' and 'Burbank' are intensely serious, and I
 think these two are among the best that I have ever done." He went
 on prophetically: "But even here I am considered by the ordinary
 Newspaper critic as a Wit or satirist, and in America I suppose I
 shall be thought merely disgusting" (<i>L</i>, 363)<i>.</i>
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 When we look upon these relationships and exchanges and realize that
 the readers and publishers of Eliot's allegedly anti-Semitic poems were
 Jews, and when we consider Eliot's state of mind during the months of
 composition, do we really want to believe that a dominant motive in
 the poetry was to exercise a little gratuitous anti-Semitism in the
 face of his Jewish friends? How might the poems be thought "intensely
 serious" rather than "merely disgusting"?
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot's brother Henry had his own sense of what Eliot was trying to do
in these poems and later wanted to write an open letter to a periodical
about the surrealism in

<b></b>

them, but he eschewed the role of embarrassing brother. He wrote to his
friend Harry Harvey: "It's there, sticking out like a barber pole, but
no critic has touched it. . . . TSE's short earlier poems are certainly
partly inspired by Picasso (et al). I think he is one of the earliest
surrealist poets. Critics have floundered around in interpreting his
Sweeney, etc. poems without discovering the surrealism which is the key
to their understanding."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 As I have discussed the Sweeney poems elsewhere as components of
 Eliot's personal myth of sexual betrayal, psychological retribution,
 and moral regeneration (<i>EDA,</i> 87-101), I want to turn to the
 surreal elements of the poem that has disturbed many readers, "Burbank
 with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar."

<p>
Why, at the end of the war, did Eliot choose to write a poem about
Venice? We know that during his year at the Sorbonne in 1910-11 he broke
away to become an avid tourist of Italy, probably with a Baedeker,
and that Venice was a major stop on his tour. He filled his notebook
with observations about the Grand Canal, the piazza, and St. Mark's
cathedral, noting parenthetically that the quadriga above the portal was
"(a particularly uninteresting set of horses"), the horses that would
later enter his poetic imagination and "Beat up the dawn from Istria/
With even feet."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Later in the day, at the Ca d'Oro, he was struck by Mantegna's <i>Saint
 Sebastian</i> (ca. 1490) and wrote down the Latin script on the
 scroll attached to the candle at the base of the painting:"<i>Nihil
 nisi divinum stabile est; caetera fumus</i>." So, when in 1919 he
 made his vicarious return to Venice in the poem, it was to portray
 his sharp sense of "Time's ruins" in relation to Dante's Italy and
 Shakespeare's Venice, to sketch the return to the post-war city of
 modern English and American tourists&#8212;gentiles and Jews&#8212;who
 have no sense of the history evoked in the poem's allusions, of the
 ethnic and religious exiles the once-great city had absorbed in the
 past, of the Italian victory over the Austrians in Venetia that led
 to the Austro-Hungarian surrender in November 1918 and the collapse
 of one of the most powerful empires in European history. To Eliot,
 Venetian Italy was symbolic of the post-Versailles diaspora, of the
 newly "contrived corridors" (<i>CPP</i>, 22) in which hotly contested
 lands and ethnic-religious dislocations and antagonisms would ensure
 the further disintegration of European unity. It is in the context
 of this diaspora that Gerontion, part Hebrew, part Hellene, sees in
 the window of his decayed European house a squatting Jewish landlord,
 a modern counterpart of Shylock, once again pushed with his people from
 nation to nation, ghetto to ghetto, "Blistered in Brussels, patched and
 peeled in London," fleeing the horrific pogroms in Poland during the
 peace process. Eliot had followed daily reports in <i>The Times</i>
 of vicious attacks in central European cities on Jewish landlords,
 merchants, and citizens, whose only trustworthy avenues of egress were
 England and America and whose plight had made the Zionist movement
 for a national home in Palestine a pressing problem at the Versailles
 conference, which in May adopted a solemn protest against the massacre
 of Jews in Eastern Europe. In the exhausted and conflicted persona
 of Gerontion, Eliot had indeed attempted to reflect the duplicitous
 attitudes toward Jews in the fragmented mind of Europe.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, the poet returns to Venice in a maddened, hallucinative state of
mind, approaching the city through a surrealistic succession of fragments
analogous to the end

<b></b>

of <i>The Waste Land</i>, where the distracted quester can connect
nothing with nothing, where similar broken images suggest the madness that
sweeps over a mind on the brink of mental and spiritual exhaustion. Here
the fragments from works by his literary predecessors in Venice over
four centuries allude to random moments of lust, adultery, mortality,
mutability, eternity: Gautier's carnival cry, "Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire,"
is immediately undercut by Mantegna's Latin subscript ("Nothing lasts
excepting what is divine; the rest is smoke"), and in the surreal
phantasmagoria we hear among others Othello's cry of "Goats and
monkeys!" as he madly anticipates proof of Desdemona's infidelity (IV,
i, 274). The Venetian mindscape that we are about to enter is unreal.

<p>
Eliot had found his way into the poem through three plays that he
was then teaching in his third-year extension course on Elizabethan
literature&#8212;Marlowe's <i>The Jew of Malta</i> and Shakespeare's
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, taught together as a unit, and Ben
Jonson's Venetian play <i>Volpone</i> (<i>EDA</i>, 46, 48), all of which
exhibited the savage humor, "the old English ferocity" that Baudelaire
had perceived in English writing and that Eliot had begun to develop as
a critic of moral life, moving ferociously beyond his earlier satires
of Matthew and Waldo, Russell and Channing.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 He conjoined Jonson's caricatures of Volpone and Paulina into his own
 Princess Volupine, of dubious imperial lineage from the city's Hapsburg
 conquerers, the sickly seductress of the lustful pushovers, Burbank,
 Bleistein, and Sir Ferdinand Klein. It is tempting to see Russell
 and Vivien in Burbank and Volupine&#8212;"They were together, and he
 fell"&#8212;not only in the casual banality of their illicit coupling
 but in the line-play from Tennyson"s "The Sisters," "he fell" for "she
 fell," the she a young woman also seduced by an Earl. After Volupine
 has exercised her wiles on Bleistein, a Chicago merchant far removed
 from his Jewish origin in Vienna and whose stereotypical mannerisms are
 captured in ferocious caricature&#8212;"A saggy bending of the knees/
 And elbows, with the palms turned out"&#8212;she entertains another
 touring Jew, Sir Ferdinand Klein. His British title and names betray
 more of his displaced and forgotten heritage than Bleistein's&#8212;from
 the Ashkinazim who had migrated to Venice from Germany, from the
 Sephardim expelled from Spain by Ferdinand. Eliot greatly admired
 Sephardic culture and traditions, and he was aware that their
 settlement in Venice led to the first gated ghetto, the insalubrious
 ghetto from which the re of Shylock would emerge. As the narrator
 follows Volupine's serial seductions of her Venetian tourists, his
 stream-of-consciousness associations surface like Bloom's&#8212;"On the
 Rialto once," "Money in furs"&#8212; alluding to the Merchants' Exchange
 where Shylock, staunchly defending his faith and tribe, determines to
 "feed fat the ancient grudge" he bears towards the Christian Antonio
 and his abusive anti-Semitism: "He hates our sacred nation, and he
 rails,/ Even there where merchants most do congregate,/ On me ... (I,
 iii, 48-51). Bleistein and Klein, Shylock's deracinated counterparts in
 Venice, cannot in collecting their pound of flesh from Volupine hold a
 candle to Shylock's tenacious defense of his religion, culture, race,
 humanity: "Hath not a Jew eyes?" he asks. "Hath not a Jew hands, organs
 . . . affections, passions? . . . And if you wrong us, shall we not
 revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that"
 (III, i, 61-66). The measure of the present against the past is thus
 taken with the savage techniques of Eliot's past masters. And when the

<b></b>

ludicrous re of Burbank, who has like the Lion of St. Marks been
clipped and flea'd and pared by Volupine, returns at the end of the
poem to ponder the domestication of the leonine emblem of Venetian power
and to meditate on "Time's ruins" and the "seven laws"&#8212;as though
the cultural and architectural erosion of Venice and its stones could
be explained by a Ruskin philosophy filtered through a Baedeker&#8212;
the savage irony of this "intensely serious" poem is complete.

<p>
Well, almost complete. There remains that disconnected, surreal
description in mid-poem. In the midst of the three illicit rendezvous,
"A lustreless protrusive eye/ Stares from the protozoic slime/ At a
perspective of Canaletto" (<i>CPP</i>, 24). This is not the eye of
Bleistein, as some would argue, there to cruelly mock in synecdoche
an exaggerted ethnic physical trait, but the blanched eye of a corpse
that surfaces from the depths of the Grand Canal, from the depths
of the narrator's consciousness, seen through the dying smoke of
Mantegna's scripted candle. It is the haunting eye of "Phl&eacute;bas,
le Ph&eacute;nician," whose corpse had surfaced for the first time
in Eliot's French poem "Dans Le Restaurant." The image of the ancient
Semitic sailor, whose presence now becomes a dominant motif in Eliot's
phantasmagoria, had its origins in the eyes of Joyce's drowned man
in the Proteus chapter, where Stephen contemplates his drowning and
surfacing: "His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death,"
says Stephen&#8212;the "saltwhite" corpse's brown eyes made "saltblue" by
his terrible "seachange," which brings to Stephen's mind the "unearthly
music" of Ariel's song, heard by Ferdinand in <i>The Tempest</i>, "Full
fathom five thy father lies . . . Those are pearls that were his eyes"
(I, ii, 397-99).
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Ferdinand's musing on the king his father's drowning and Ariel's
 horrific description of the drowned corpse's eyes were to become
 for Eliot an irrepressible allusion in his surrealistic sequence of
 poems (his own father had died the previous January). In "Burbank,"
 the water-sick, staring eye triggers images of corpse-chewing rats
 beneath the piles, prompted by Shylock's imagery of the rat-infested
 ghetto when he adamantly defends his pound-of-flesh interest before the
 Venetian court of justice: "What if my house be troubled with a rat" he
 asks the court, "And I be pleased/ To give ten thousand ducats/ To have
 it baned? What, are you answered yet?" (IV, i, 44-46) Shylock's ghetto
 rats and Maurice's trench rats are now loosed in Eliot's imagination,
 to appear repeatedly with the staring corpse in succeeding poems. "The
 jew"&#8212;Phlebas, the Phoenician Jew&#8212;"is underneath the lot";
 yes, but not in the deprecatory sense of Jewish usury or mercantilism,
 a hostile charge repeatedly voiced in Europe and reported in the
 papers. Eliot knew the terrible irony that the new foundations of
 post-war Europe were being laid on the corpses of Jews.

<p>
When Bleistein himself is recast as a drowned corpse in that macabre
funeral lament, "Dirge," he too rests on his back at the very bottom of
the sea, under the one-eyed flatfish, under the wharf rats, deep in the
poetic consciousness, "with a stare of dull surprise."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 "Full fathom five thy Bleistein lies," Eliot begins. And like Joyce he
 lets Ariel's song suffuse the gruesome scene, exclaiming in a draft,
 "Those are pearls that were his eyes. See!" (<i>WLF</i>, 123) before
 withdrawing and reserving the line in favor of a more graphic image
 of the swollen, discolored eyes in their watery grave&#8212;"Graves'
 disease in a dead jew's eyes," a terribly debilitating disease that
 swells the

<b></b>

eyes as they hemorrhage and the capillaries bloom into bright red swirls
and streaks, a condition made even more ghastly in a seachange. As
Joyce's corpse "breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his
leprous nosehole snoring to the sun" (<i>U</i>, 3.480-81), so Eliot's
Bleistein exhibits the "lace that was his nose" as bones peep through
his ragged toes, his lips unfold, and the lobsters work on the flesh,
"scratch scratch scratch" (<i>WLF</i>, 119).

<p>
Eliot's hideous dream of the drowned bodies is unremittingly unreal. So,
when in "The Burial of the Dead" Madame Sosostris turns up from her
Tarot pack "your card, the drowned Phoenican Sailor," it is an illusory
card&#8212;there is no such Tarot re&#8212; and the corpse the
narrator sees is immediately described in Ariel's words ("Those are pearls
that were his eyes. Look!"). She then turns up yet another illusory card,
"the one-eyed merchant," a Bleistein re who becomes Mr. Eugenides, of
Sephardic descent from Smyrna, ousted in the aftermath of the Treaty. In
these changing shapes, the Phoenician Sailor stalks <i>The Waste Land</i>,
even as the phantom, disembodied voice who replies to the neurasthenic
woman who demands to know what he is thinking: "I think we are in rats'
alley/ Where the dead men lost their bones." And when she asks him
"Do you remember/ Nothing?" he replies, "I remember/ Those are pearls
that were his eyes," promising that at the end of the day "we shall
play a game of chess,/ Pressing lidless eyes . . ." The ubiquitous rat
returns in "The Fire Sermon," "Dragging its slimy belly on the bank/
While I"&#8212;the Sailor transred into Ferdinand&#8212;"was fishing
in the dull canal . . . Musing upon the king my brother's wreck/ And on
the king my father's death before him." Before him lie "White bodies
naked on the low damp ground . . . Rattled by the rat's foot only,
year to year." As Eliot confirmed these surreal transrations in the
notes, "the one-eyed merchant . . . melts into the Phoenician Sailor,
and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples"
(<i>CPP</i>, 52). All, including Bleistein, are embodied in Phlebas,
who has become Eliot's Everyman of the Dead, the same sea currents
picking his bones that rolled Bleistein side to side. So in section IV,
"Fear Death by Water," when the narrator issues the gentle imperative,
"Gentile or Jew . . . Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as
you," this ambiguous section of the poem becomes in Eliot's phantasma a
somber elegiac cry, a saner eulogistic pause, a less horrific dirge for
the war dead&#8212;a dirge for the Verdenals and Rosenbergs and Brookes,
the gentiles and Jews of Europe, all beneath the piles, their lidless
eyes washed out, their bones chewed clean in rats' alley.

<p>
<i>The Waste Land</i>and <i>The Criterion</i>, the one launching the
other in 1922, were perhaps symbolic of Eliot's post-sanitorium recovery
of mental health and his post-war commitment to the reconstruction of the
European mind. As he left <i>The Waste Land</i>behind and moved toward
his formal conversion in 1927, he used the <i>Criterion</i> and other
venues to expand and intensify his earlier critique of nineteenth-century
humanists to their contemporary counterparts in England&#8212;John
Middleton Murry, Bertrand Russell, I. A. Richards, and others. At the same
time he began developing his theories of literary and cultural decline,
first locating "dissociation of sensibility" in the seventeenth century,
and then, in a more searching analysis of the shift from classicism

<b></b>

to romanticism in his 1926 Clark Lectures, redefining the dissociation of
sensibility as a larger "disintegration of the intellect" that followed
the age of Dante and the Trecento.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 By the time he wrote his essay on "Dante" , the abominable Treaty
 of Versailles had taken its place in his larger cultural and historical
 perspective: "It is not particularly the Treaty of Versailles that has
 separated nation from nation," he wrote; "the process of disintegration
 which for our generation culminates in that treaty began soon after
 Dante's time."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 The twofold thrust of Eliot's social analysis during the decade was
 to trace over several centuries the subtle changes in the relation
 of religion and culture that had affected the creative sensibility,
 and, simultaneously, to show the more deleterious effects of the
 growth of secular humanism on modern European culture. The latter
 preoccupation is seen in his essay on "Niccolo Machiavelli" ,
 where he looks at an early moment in the post-Trecento decline. Here
 he sympathizes with Machiavelli's taking the humiliation of Italy
 by foreign invaders as a personal humiliation, with his portrayal of
 "how the neglect of religion, occasioned by the vagaries of the Church
 of Rome, had contributed to the ruin of Italy," and with his certainty
 "that a religious establishment of some kind is necessary to a nation."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 The world of human motives that Machiavelli depicts, Eliot asserts,
 "is true&#8212;that is to say, it is humanity without the addition of
 superhuman Grace"&#8212;and to those modern humanists who have supported
 "the effort of the last three centuries to supply religious belief
 by belief in Humanity," he declares, "the creed of Machiavelli is
 insupportable" (<i>FLA</i>, 63). While the targets of this statement
 still included Matthew and Waldo and their contemporary successors,
 he had also fixed his eye on a new type of free-thinking scholar in
 post-War American universities, the New Humanists, disciples of Irving
 Babbitt, led by the Harvard literary critic Norman Foerster. Eliot's
 confrontation with these lost-in-the-attic intellectuals is crucial
 to understanding the context of his allegedly anti-Semitic statement
 in <i>AfterStrange Gods</i>.

<p>
Babbitt had by happenstance appeared in London in 1927 and paid his first
visit to his former pupil. When in the drift of conversation Babbitt
informed him that his friend and fellow humanist Paul Elmer More was
converting to Anglican Christianity, Eliot presented Babbitt with the
"minor shock" of his own recent conversion. Babbitt then convinced Eliot
that it was his duty to "come out into the open."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 It was this conversation with his old master that led Eliot to declare
 in the Preface to <i>For Lancelot Andrewes</i> that the point of view
 behind his work was "classicist in literature, royalist in politics,
 and anglo-catholic in religion" (<i>FLA</i>, ix). Ironically, Babbitt
 had also forced Eliot to come out in the open about the weaknesses of
 Babbitt's humanism.

<p>
Eliot maintained an undying respect for Babbitt as a thinker and humanist,
but he had precious little respect for Babbitt's disciples. Eliot saw
them as zealots who, as literary critics with inadequate philosophical
training, were transforming if not betraying Babbitt's humanism into
what he described to the editor of the <i>Bookman</i> as "the hard and
fast dogma of a new ethical church, or something between a church and
a political party."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 To discredit the disciples, however, he felt that he had to show the
 fundamental flaw of the master. Eliot accepted the fact that Babbitt
 was a non-believer who could not accept any dogma or revelation,
 and he accepted the pure humanism

<b></b>

that he had constructed; it was when Babbitt proposed to set up
humanism as a substitute for religion that Eliot had to confront him
harshly in print: "His humanism is really quite different from that of
his exemplars," he wrote in "The Humanism of Irving Babbitt" ,
"but (to my mind) alarmingly like very liberal Protestant theology of
the nineteenth century: it is, in fact, a product . . . of Protestant
theology in its last agonies" (<i>SE</i>, 422). Eliot saw Babbitt's
doctrine of self control, in which he envisions a society of individuals
controlling themselves with an "inner check" or "higher will," as no more
than another version of Arnold's "best self making for righteousness,"
as another version of Wilson's League of Nations and the Americanization
of Europe. Foerster, a disciple of Babbitt who heretically included
Emerson and Arnold among those who had clarified the humanist ideal,
responded to Eliot's essay by defending Babbitt and arguing that "our
age as a whole . . . insistently claims that the way out of our present
chaos must . . . follow critical and individualistic lines. We cannot see
a time when the principle of outer authority will again be acceptable."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 Eliot's "Second Thoughts About Humanism"  was thus directed
 against Foerster and the "second generation" of free-thinking American
 humanists, describing Foerster's culture as "a propagation of Arnold's"
 and asserting that humanism is in the end futile and sterile without
 religion (<i>SE</i>, 434). When Foerster gathered and edited the first
 collection of essays by the New Humanists, <i>Humanism and America:
 Essays on the Outlook of Modern Civilization</i>, Eliot was
 admitted as a counter-movement antagonist with his give-and-take essay
 entitled "Religion without Humanism," in which he makes the corollary
 assertion that religion depends upon humanism, that without it religion
 deteriorates and produces conflicting types of religious bigotry,
 particularly in America.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 While he was preparing the essay, he confided to Paul Elmer More that
 "Foerster thinks that he and his fellows are the saving remnant [of
 culture], but they seem to me a bargain sale remnant, shopworn."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 What he had come to believe was that human wisdom separated from
 divine wisdom remains worldly and vain, "as vain as folly itself,"
 the primary theme of "East Coker," where he questions the "receipt for
 deceit" bequeathed by humanists from his own Renaissance ancestor to the
 present: "Do not let me hear/ Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of
 their folly,/ Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,/
 Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God" (<i>CPP</i>, 125-26).
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 But the immediate importance of Eliot's three-year engagement with the
 American Humanists was not only that it made him establish the sine
 qua non of his cultural criticism&#8212;the inextricable relation of
 religion and culture and humanism&#8212;but that it consolidated his
 point of view for subsequent engagements with the myriad forms of
 secularism he would soon encounter.

<p>
The New Humanists have led us to a corner of the attic where we suddenly
discover with astonishment Eliot's fugitive correspondence with an
American intellectual whose lifelong friendship with Eliot and whose role
in Eliot's dialectic with Jews and Judaism in the attempted reconstruction
of Judaeo-Christian culture before and after World War II restores a
missing chapter of American cultural history. Recently uncovered in the
American Jewish Archives is an amazing cache of letters between Eliot and

<b></b>

Horace M. Kallen, a Jewish social philosopher and Zionist at the New
School for Social Research in New York.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 When the correspondence picks up in October 1927, Eliot has owed Kallen
 a letter for five months, and when it drops off thirty-three years
 later we have witnessed a dimension of Eliot's private intellectual
 life that must alter our many presumptions about it. There may be more
 and earlier letters, for it turns out that Kallen and Eliot had been
 close friends at Harvard from 1906 to 1911.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Kallen, the foreign-born son of a rabbi who had immigrated to Boston from
Germany in 1882, had preceded Eliot as an undergraduate at Harvard, taking
his degree in English and a teaching position at Princeton in 1903. When
his position was not renewed, on the administration's discovery that
he was a Jew, he returned to Harvard in 1906, Eliot's freshman year,
to study philosophy and found the Menorah Society, whose aim in part
was to help students create a secular Jewish identity. The ideas of
Emerson and Spinoza had helped Kallen gain intellectual independence
from his father's orthodox Judaism, but the teaching of Wendell Barrett,
who showed him that the Hebrew Bible and the Hebraic tradition had
greatly influenced the Puritan mind and the American character, helped
him reclaim his Jewishness, if not his Jewish religion. As a disciple of
William James and Santayana, who "brought me," he says, "an excitement and
liberation of mind without parallel in my academic exerience," he could
not have had an intellectual orientation at Harvard more the opposite of
Eliot's with Babbitt and Royce. "Royce's courses held no such allure as
did Santayana's and James's," Kallen wrote. "But, although I disagreed
with him from the very beginning, my studies with him, even through the
dissent they aroused, nourished and on occasion enhanced the feelings
of release and adventure that came from my studies with his colleagues."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 Ironically, however, Royce made Kallen his graduate assistant,
 and Kallen's friendship with Eliot may have begun in Royce's open
 seminars. In 1911, he left for a position at Wisconsin, where, in 1918,
 he published <i>The Book of Job as Greek Tragedy</i>, a book that
 Eliot read and admired, a book that initiates his attempts to bring
 together the Hebraic and Hellenic systems in a radical reinterpretation
 of Arnold's terms for his own use.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 Kallen left Wisconsin in 1919 to become a founding member of the New
 York School of Social Research, and by 1924, in <i>Culture and Democracy
 in the United States</i>, he had begun to develop his theory of "the
 American idea," a secular humanist theory which made him, in effect,
 the Jewish counterpart to Babbitt and the New Humanists.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 When his friendly correspondence with Eliot resumed in 1927, Kallen
 was making repeated efforts to bring him to the school to lecture and
 read, an arrangement that finally materialized in the spring of 1933
 when Eliot was Norton Professor at Harvard.

<p>
It proved to be a busy spring of lectures and teaching. At the end of
January Eliot went to Johns Hopkins to deliver his Turnbull Lectures on
"The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry," staying the week as house guest
of the Jewish philosopher George Boas, who, he told Kallen, had been his
closest friend in graduate school. The next week Eliot began teaching
his undergraduate course on Contemporary English Literature at Harvard,
and in his discussion of James's <i>The Aspern Papers</i> he brought in
"Burbank with a Baedeker, Bleistein with a Cigar," which alludes to
James's novel in

<b></b>

the epigraph: "the gondola stopped, the old palace was there, how charming
its grey and pink" (<i>CPP</i>, 23). James's problem in talking about
Venice as the center of the tale, he told his students, was similar to
his problem in "Bleistein": "To get Venice not too directly&#8212;every
reference to Venice should call up something else as well and vice versa."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 The name Ferdinand, for example, should suggest both the Spanish
 and Austrian branches of the Hapsburgs, Ferdinand the heir apparent
 whose assassination in 1914 precipitated the war, and Shakespeare's
 Ferdinand. Eliot's further problem was to "make a place real not
 descriptively but by something happening there." It is clear that the
 "something happening"&#8212;through Burbank, Bleistein, and Klein in
 Venice&#8212;is meant to be an objective correlative for a general
 cultural diminishment in Europe after the war and in relation to
 an ancient past. And then he turns to the "lustreless protrusive
 eye" of the poem. The eyes, he says emphatically, are "<i>not</i>
 described," insisting that "that is not a failure, except in the
 nature of language&#8212;what is important is not to describe the
 indescribable, but to note its effect." Eliot does not convey in his
 lecture notes the desired effect of the indescribable eyes, but we
 know from following them in their phantasmal sequence how Jamesian
 and Joycean that horrific effect is realized.

<p>
In the midst of this course Eliot went to lecture and read at the New
School and to renew his friendship with Kallen, with whom he stayed and
by whom he was entertained.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 During this week Eliot met and was greatly impressed by Benjamin
 Cardozo, then a Justice of the United States Supreme Court and a member
 of New York's oldest Sephardic congregation. When Eliot later recounted
 his evening with Cardozo to his producer, Henry Sherek, he described
 Cardozo as being "singularly distinguished amongst all the guests"
 and remarked, "I have always been attracted by Sephardim."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
At the same time, Eliot was preparing his Page-Barbour Lectures at the
University of Virginia, published as <i>After Strange Gods: A Primer of
Modern Heresy</i>. He had intended to develop all the lectures on the
material he was teaching in his Harvard course, but he had received
a letter from the faculty coordinator, Scott Buchanan, asking him to
extend his concept of tradition in relation to the "old tradition"
of the South and the attempts of the Southern Agrarians to preserve
it. Eliot was, of course, familiar with the views of Allen Tate and
others described in <i>I'll Take My Stand</i> , which had appeared
as a kind of counterfoil to Foerster's <i>Humanism in America</i><i>.</i>
"Almost anybody here who has spent time in Europe or even New York plays
speculatively and a little fearfully with Catholicism," wrote Buchanan,
"but the strong current of Protestantism of the Baptist and Methodist
variety soon uproots any seedlings that have sprouted. . . . I have no
fears about your sensitivity to the situation and the effectiveness of
your communications."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 Well, Eliot tried to comply, telling his audience that he came into
 the South as a "Yankee," and I need not remind you that this was the
 occasion when Eliot, advising them about reestablishing and preserving
 a traditional culture and religious tradition in an increasingly
 industrialized region, stated that "reasons of race and religion
 combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
This unfortunate statement, one of the most quoted and disdained in
modern literary and cultural studies, has pained many readers of Eliot,
including myself, and my purpose in bringing it forward again is not to
excuse it but to reconstruct a context that

<b></b>

shows that it is not, regardless of its appearance, an anti-Semitic
statement; it is an anti-free-thinking statement.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 To Eliot, any large number of free-thinking New Humanists&#8212;or any
 secular humanists, Christian or Jewish&#8212;would be intellectually
 "undesirable," for in diminishing the role of religion in culture
 they would threaten the very project of reestablishing a traditional,
 religion-based culture. Indeed, when Eliot's long-time friend and
 <i>Criterion</i> contributor Isaiah Berlin accosted him about the
 sentence when he came across it in 1951, Eliot replied that "the
 sentence of which you complain (with justice) would of course never
 have appeared at all at that time, if I had been aware of what was
 going to happen, indeed had already begun, in Germany . . . I still
 do not understand why the word 'race' occurs in the sentence, because
 my emphasis was on the adjective 'free-thinking.'"
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 As Eliot explained to a former Harvard student, "By free-thinking
 Jews I mean Jews who have given up the practice and belief of their
 own religion . . . The Jewish religion . . . shorn of its traditional
 practices, observances and Messianism . . . tends to become a mild
 and colourless form of Unitarianism. . . . But my view," he insisted,
 "does not imply any prejudice on the ground of race, but merely a
 recognition of what seems to me an historical situation. It is quite
 possible, of course, that all people of Christian descent will become so
 emancipated from Christianity in the course of time that this sentence
 of mine will cease to have any meaning."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 Having come to Virginia from the New School, it is likely that Eliot
 had the free-thinking humanism of Kallen freshly in mind; he would
 not have hesitated to make the statement in Kallen's presence. Though
 Kallen and Eliot never discuss the episode in their letters, Kallen
 would certainly have understood Eliot's intention in relation to
 their own dialogue on the relation of culture, humanism, and religion;
 it certainly had no effect on their friendship. Boas reportedly took
 offense, as have many others since, unjustly so, as will be seen.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 The one word that Eliot deeply regretted in the sentence was "race"
 ("reasons of race and religion"), evident in his response to a critical
 exchange between Edward Dahlberg and Herbert Read, where Dahlberg
 recounts an occasion when F. S. Flint asked him to join Eliot and others
 for a pub lunch. "Flint said to me: 'Tom does not like Jews.' However,
 Eliot was gracious and kind, and did all that he could to be of use
 to me. I blame Eliot for nothing except the books that he has written."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 After the exchange appeared, Eliot wrote to an uneasy Read: "I don't
 think you have any reason to worry about Dahlberg's impression of me
 or anybody else. . . . I only regret Frank Flint's foolish remark and
 Dahlberg's belief in my anti-semitism&#8212;perhaps you believe in this
 too as you don't rebut it&#8212;but at any rate there is only one word
 [race] in my printed works which I regret and I do not know what my
 mind was when I wrote it."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
Meanwhile, after having prepared<i>After Strange Gods</i> for press in
the summer, Eliot and Kallen had more pressing concerns at hand. In
December, Kallen sent Eliot a circular regarding a new International
League for Academic Freedom, founded in reaction to the growing
repression of European academics for their opinions but particularly
to call "attention to the thousands of teachers and men of science in
concentration camps." In March 1933, Heinrich Himmler, then head of the
Munich police, had established the first concentration camp in Dachau,
and the detainment and flight

<b></b>

of German Jewish intellectuals had begun. A small group of the League
for Academic Freedom had organized itself in France, and Kallen sought
Eliot's assistance in spreading the organization. "What do you think
can be done about organizing analogous groups in England?" Kallen asked
him on 27 December 1933. Eliot immediately sent a letter to A. L. Rowse
at Oxford, asking him for ideas about forming academic groups to help
Jewish refugees.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 Eliot then took the initiative to assist and befriend refugees on his
 own, including the sociologist Karl Mannheim and the economist Adolph
 L&ouml;we, Jewish professors who arrived in London after being forced
 out of their respective chairs at Frankfurt University in 1933. Both
 were to join Eliot in a group called the Moot, organized in 1938 to
 discuss the social, political, economic, and ideological challenges
 of the times, to oppose tendencies in Germany, and later to address
 problems of national reconstruction. Through Kallen, Eliot helped
 Adolph L&ouml;we land a position at the New School in 1940. And though
 Eliot expressed his disagreement in <i>Notes Toward the Definition
 of Culture</i> with Mannheim's theory of elites, he was moved on
 Mannheim's death in 1947 to write a supplementary obituary for him
 in the <i>Times</i>, praising his deep concern for the principles
 of cultural reconstruction and affirming for himself and others a
 tremendous personal and intellectual debt.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Shortly after writing the heartfelt tribute to Mannheim, Eliot received
 a letter from Edward Field of New York, accusing him of anti-Semitism
 in his poetry. "I am afraid that you are over-sensitive," Eliot replied,
 "and like some other people inclined to find anti-semitism wherever the
 word Jew is used in connection with an individual who is not depicted
 as one of the finer types of his people. There is no anti-semitism in my
 poetry whatever. You have probably noticed a Jewish character in a poem
 about Venice in which the reader is meant to infer some contrast between
 Venice of modern times and that depicted in Shakespeare's play. There
 is also a reference to a Jewish landlord in another poem." Eliot
 was always faced with the presumption of his guilt, particularly
 from academics whose presumptions quickly hardened into fact. "It
 might have been reasonable of you on the basis of these two uses of
 the word Jew," Eliot replied to Field, "to enquire whether I had any
 anti-semitic feelings or not. It is certainly not reasonable of you to
 draw that inference and base your letter on the assumption. I am no more
 anti-semitic than I am anti-Welsh or anti-Eskimo. With best wishes."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>

<p>
The cowardly appeasement of Hitler by England and France over his
demands for the Sudetenland during the Munich Crisis of September 1938,
and the failure of the League of Nations in this regard, left Eliot
so disspirited about the future of Europe that he decided to bring
the <i>Criterion</i>to a close in January 1939. And on the advent of
war he must have felt some deep urgency, too, to write his Boutwood
lectures at Cambridge on <i>The Idea of a Christian Society</i><i>.</i>
After the demise of the <i>Criterion</i>, Eliot and other members of
the Moot founded the <i>Christian News-Letter</i><i>,</i> and in the
issue of September 1941 he wrote a special commentary deploring the
Vichy government's anti-Semitic policies and expressing his hope that
Christians would speak out against them:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What gives us the gravest anxiety, is the statement . . . in the
<i>Times</i>. . . that "Jews have been give a special status, based on the laws of
Nuremberg, which makes their condition

<b></b>

little better than that of bondsmen." Anti-Semitism there has always
been, among the parties of the extreme Right: but it was a very different
thing, as a symptom of the disorder of French society and politics for
the last hundred and fifty years, from what it is when it takes its place
as a principle of reconstruction. If this is what is happening, we can
only hope that there has been, or that there will be, some organized
protest against such injustice, by the French ecclesiastical hierarchy. . . But unless the French Church, and the Protestant bodies in France
rise to protest, we must feel serious doubts about the way in which the
revival of Christian France . . . is to be carried out.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot not only spoke out against anti-Semitism; he gave personal
assistance to Jewish refugees as well: we do not know as yet how many
refugees Eliot assisted during the war, but the Kallen letters give us
a glimpse of his private efforts. On 16 November 1941, Eliot wrote to
Kallen on behalf of Mary Trevelyan, who sought Eliot's help in finding
relief for a Jewish refugee named John Amon, described as "a charming and
cultivated man, one of the best and most interesting refugees who have
come to England," a rare-books dealer and Japanese print collector who had
escaped from Vienna to England before going to America, where he was now
in desperate straits. "Forgive my appealing to you," wrote Eliot, "but I
believe that you are a person who takes such matters seriously, and I do
want to put him in touch with the right people!" Kallen happily received
the charge: "I will do what I can about your John Amon," he replied on
7 January 1942, "and I will speak about him to L&ouml;we. Here's to a
reunion in 1943 with our victorious armies in Berlin!"

<p>
When the war finally ended, Eliot was in dialogue with Jewish
intellectuals and Zionists about the problems and the principles of social
reconstruction. Indicative of his multicultural position as influenced
by Kallen and others is an essay originally entitled "The Responsibility
of the Man of Letters and the Cultural Restoration of Europe" ,
in which he stated his conviction "that for the preservation of any
European culture, as well as for the health of its national components,
a perpetual cultivation of the sources of that culture, in Greece and
Rome, and a continual refreshment from them, are necessary. I should
say Israel also, but that I wish to confine myself, so far as that is
possible, to the cultural rather than the religious aspect."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Kallen played his own role in directing people to Eliot, sending to him
 in 1946 Dr. Alfred J. Marrow, a leader of the American Jewish Congress
 and the World Jewish Congress. Marrow is "very much concerned over the
 Jewish situation," wrote Kallen in his letter of introduction on 23
 May, "and the practical steps that might be taken to ease it, first
 in Palestine and secondly in the rest of the uprooted world. . . . I
 want Dr. Marrow to know you and you to know him, and I want him to get
 a perspective of the problems of reconstruction in England and Europe
 through your eyes."

<p>
The mutual respect of the two friends was unflagging, despite their
diametrically opposed social thought. When word came of Eliot's Nobel
prize, Kallen was quick to write on 20 November 1948 that the news
"brought all your old friends a great deal of satisfaction. I must say
though, I was myself intrigued by the terms of the award&#8212;for
your technique not your thought." And when Kallen was honored with
a festschrift for his own achievements, Eliot contributed his essay
"From Poe to Val&eacute;ry," happy to pay

<b></b>

his testimony "to a man whose mind and achievements I have always admired,
and whose personality I hold in enduring affection."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
 "Your being among [the contributors] is especially heartening," Kallen
 had written to Eliot on 25 July 1953, "for our philosophic faiths have
 been not only diverse but in many respects incommensurable, and I am
 quite sure that not a few among your closest aficionados as well as
 among your most unfriendly critics will be crying, 'What the devil is
 he doing in that gallery!' I like to think that the answer would be
 you're there because you recognize that artists and thinkers sustain
 the integrity of their singular vision and action only as 'a sporting
 fellowship even among opposite minds.'"

<p>
That sporting fellowship was to reach its most competitive intensity in
November 1954, when Eliot was asked to respond to a paper that Kallen
gave to the American Jewish Congress on his concept of the "American
Idea," a phrase that Kallen took from the Unitarian abolitionist Theodore
Parker, who meant by it the unification of faiths under a Declaration of
Independence that provided for equal rights while asserting the separation
of church and state. Kallen adopted the idea for his own belief that a
diversity of faiths may be united in a national religion, a religion
that binds together people who need to cultivate their diversities
in a spirit of tolerance, free from aggression and persecution by
others. Eliot was aggrieved that in his address about American Jewry
Kallen was concerned not with Jewish religion but with Jewish culture,
a culture that Kallen wished to remain distinct and wholly Americanized
but not "assimilated." Eliot, who thought such a condition would bring
back the Wilsonian term of "hyphenated Americans," agreed that Jews
had the duty to maintain a distinct Jewish culture while being fully
American. On 26 November he wrote to Kallen:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
But the odd thing is that I believe it on the grounds which do not seem
to be considered in your argument: that is to say, because of the Jewish
religion. The only problem that seems to me vital is the religious
problem. The racial problem, as between Jews and Gentiles, ought not
to exist: and as between Jews who have abandoned their religion, and
Christians . . . who have abandoned theirs, it is a matter of indifference
which body is "assimilated" to the other. What I feel sure of is, that a
<i>culture</i>
is the outcome of, the living garment of, a religion. . . . I beg you,
Horace, not to put the phrase "the religion of America" into circulation.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But Kallen would not accommodate Eliot by admitting that the culture was
dependent on the religion; moreover, in the following months he published
a book whose title was a torment to Eliot, <i>Secularism is the Will
of God</i> , a book that further developed the "American Idea"
and whose title he clarified to Eliot's dismay: "secularism <i>is</i> the
will of God for every nation that is concerned about peace and freedom for
the diversity of its inhabitants and its relations with other nations."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 To Eliot, Kallen's "American Idea" was no more than a vague deism,
 at best a "mystique." "I gather that American Jews seem to you to
 have cut themselves off from their history," Eliot wrote on 2 April
 1955. "Certainly this is regrettable, but is that not equally true
 of other peoples after becoming Americanised? You speak of 'Jewish
 Education': do you suggest that there should be separate schools and
 colleges? I should not disapprove of

<b></b>

<i>religious</i> foundations, but any segregation on the basis of
<i>race</i> seems to me undesirable. I am interested in the conservation
of Jewish culture not as representing a race so much as representing a
religion." At the end of the letter, looking back over their positions
and arguments during past months and years, Eliot brought a remarkable
conclusion to the thirty-year dialectic: "You know, it seems to me
that you have been defending a religion called the American Idea&#8212;
and that it is I who have been defending a religion called Judaism." As
Joyce's Buck Mulligan describes the Hebraic Bloom to Stephen as being
"Greeker than the Greeks" (<i>U</i>, 9.614-15), the Hellenic and Christian
Eliot in his dialogue with Kallen had become more Jewish than the Jewish
after all.

<p>
That is the way it had always been for Eliot, a religious and not a
racial matter. This he emphasized in a letter of 10 November 1955 to
Dr. Harry Cohen, head of the American Jewish Literary Foundation, who
asked Eliot to comment on the contribution of Jews to modern life. "As
a Christian I must naturally desire that everyone in the world should
be converted to Christianity," Eliot prefaced his reply, "but, short of
this millennial ideal I . . . wish to see the Jewish Faith survive. A
culture can . . . survive for some time the religion without which it
would not have arisen: but I do not believe that it can continue forever
if the religion dies. If the Jewish religion disappeared, there would
still be 'contributions' . . . by individuals whose ancestors had been
Jews. But the common civilisation to which those whose <i>ancestors</i>
had been Jews, and those whose <i>ancestors</i> had been Christians,
were contributing, would be an inferior civilisation."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
 To Eliot, one of the most significant Jewish contributions had come
 from Isaac Rosenberg, who succeeded in writing out of Hebraic life
 in spite of a secular age. Rosenberg's poetry, wrote Eliot, "does
 not only owe its distinction to its being Hebraic: but <i>because</i>
 it is Hebraic it is a contribution to English literature. For a Jewish
 poet to be able to write like a Jew, in western Europe and in a western
 European language, is almost a miracle."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<p>
That Eliot's ideal Christian culture accommodated Jewish religion and
culture is no less evident in letters to one of the final correspondents
of his life, the Jewish publisher Victor Gollancz, who, in sending Eliot
one of his edited anthologies containing a passage from <i>Murder in
the Cathedral</i>, described himself on 27 July 1962 as "a sort of Jew."
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
 Eliot replied on 1 August by sending him a copy of the new paperback
 edition  of <i>Notes Toward the Definition of Culture</i>,
 pointing him to added material and notes and stating that he should be
 happier if Gollancz could say that he was "a professing Jew." "It seems
 to me highly desirable," Eliot had written in the new edition, "that
 there should be close culture-contact between devout and practising
 Christians and devout and practising Jews. Much culture-contact in
 the past has been within those neutral zones of culture in which
 religion can be ignored, and between Jews and Gentiles both more or
 less emancipated from their religious traditions."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
 When Gollancz explained the ambivalent nature of his own Judaism at
 some length, Eliot replied on 10 August that he wanted "to get you to
 talk to me about the difficulties of being a Jew in the modern world
 and under very different conditions from those known by the Jews of
 the Old Testament. I must explain that what interests me is religion
 and not race, and that it is in so far as a man's faith derives from
 that of the Jews of the Old

<b></b>

Testament that I am interested in the fact that he is a Jew. It is
difficult enough to be a Christian in the modern world and it seems to
me all the more difficult to be a Jew. You seem to have to me enough
of Judaism in you to qualify as a Jew in my sight!" At the end of the
culture war, Eliot, tired of conducting conflicts with secular humanists
in no man's land, warmly welcomed followers of the Jewish religion into
his idea of a Christian society.

<p>
It has been difficult to find some comic relief in the presentation of
these serious revisionist matters, but at least I can close not with
another American intellectual but with an American comedian, one of
Eliot's last and most enjoyable friends, Groucho Marx, with whom he
exchanged inscribed photographs, good cigars, and shameless puns. In
June 1963, when Groucho informed Eliot that he would stop off in London
on his return from Israel with the promise that "you and I will get
drunk together," Eliot, recovering from illness, replied, "This is not
altogether bad news because I shall be in better condition for drinking
in October than I am now." And then he added, having observed since 1919
the successful establishment of Jewish culture and national independence
in Israel, "I envy you going to Israel and I wish I could go there too. . . as I have a keen admiration for that country."
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
 Groucho's own illness delayed for a year their "memorable evening"
 together, as he described it to Gummo Marx. "I tossed in a quotation
 from 'The Waste Land.' That, I thought, will show him I've read a
 thing or two besides my press notices from vaudeville. . . . Did I
 tell you we called him Tom?&#8212;possibly because that's his name. I,
 of course, asked him to call me Tom too, but only because I loathe
 the name Julius."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
 With the work of culture done, the problems of race and religion put
 aside, with the burdens of Julius and Bleistein removed, the two Toms,
 Groucho with a bourbon, Eliot with a cigar, his death but six months
 away, rolled their eyes and laughed the world away, throwing out
 misquotations from <i>The Waste Land</i>, which I take the liberty of
 doing myself: "Gentile or Jew . . . Reconsider Eliot, philo-Semite,
 who was once handsome and tall as you."

<i>Dial</i> 70 (April 1921): 449-50. Following the Turkish massacre
of Armenians during the war, President Wilson had in November 1920
attempted to fulfill the Allied promise of reestablishing an Armenian
state by drawing definitive frontiers, but the designated area had
already been overwhelmed in October by resurgent Turks; in December,
the Armenian Communist party established the Armenian Soviet Socialist
Republic under the protection and control of Bolshevik Russia. In a later
discussion of Wilson and the League, Eliot asserted that the League "is
Modernism in the political field. . . . I am not attacking the League,
but seeking for a definition of its limitations: it can function all
the better, if we recognise what these limitations are. But it would be
better still if its inventor had himself seen these limitations, for what
sentimentalism initiates, cynicism and intrigue can exploit. The great
weakness of Woodrow Wilson was a theological weakness." See "Catholicism

only kindness and understanding. The finest evidence can be found in
his rich and warm obituary notice in <i>The Times</i>, in July, 1962,
of Mrs. Violet Schiff. In his contribution to the obituary on 9 July, 18,
Eliot recalled his memories of the Schiffs and their friends, stating that
"the Schiff's hospitality, generosity, and encouragement meant much to
a number of young artists and writers of whom I was one. . . . I write
primarily to pay homage to a beloved friend, but also in the hope that
some future chronicler of the history of art and letters in our time may

Eliot was so dismayed over the critical neglect of Rosenberg's poems
that he wrote in the following year, "Let the public . . . ask itself
why it has never heard of the poems of T. E. Hulme or of Isaac Rosenberg,
and why it has heard of the poems of Lady Precocia Pondoeuf and has seen
a photograph of the nursery in which she wrote them. Let it trace out
the writers who are not spoken of because it is to no one's interest to
speak of them, and the writers who are spoken well of because it is to
no one's interest to take the trouble to disparage them." See "A Brief
Treatise on the Criticism of Poetry," <i>Chapbook</i> 2 (March 1920):
2. In his letter to the <i>Observer</i> of 18 June 1967 (see also note
20), Jacob Isaacs recalled that "It was from Schiff that Eliot first
heard of Isaac Rosenberg and Eliot praised him and spread his fame long
before the bandwagon rumbled. He once said to me that no English anthology
that did not include Rosenberg was worth anything." He continues: "In
French poetry, [Eliot] was very fond of the two French Jewish poets,
Ephraim Mikha&euml;l and Henri Franck, whose 'Dance before the Ark' he
specially admired. At least that is what he told me, and I don't think
he would have taken the trouble to lie. This was not anti-semitism. It
was grist for the mills of Gaza."

Eliot was to reaffirm this view of his Sweeney poems in a letter to his
brother on 8 December 1922: "I consider my Sweeney poems as serious as
anything I have ever written, in fact much more serious as well as more
mature than the early poems but I do not know anybody who agrees with
me on this point except Vivien and William Butler Yeats who have both
said much the same thing about them" (<i>L</i>, 608).

Almost fifty years later, Michael Goldman wrote to Leonard Woolf to ask
him "If from your personal knowledge of Eliot, you would consider that
he had anti-semitic traits." "I don't quite know what the answer to your
question is," Woolf replied on 30 August 1967. "I think T.S. Eliot was
slightly anti-semitic in the sort of vague way which is not uncommon. He
would have denied it quite genuinely." <i>Letters of Leonard Woolf</i>,

On 28 February 1919, the <i>Times</i> reported that one of the Entente
powers was to be named the mandatory power for establishing a national
home for the Jews in Palestine. "It seems probable that the present
places of immigration for Jews&#8212;America and England&#8212;will
not be open to them or others discontented with their present homes,
for England and America will, it seems certain, be compelled to close
their doors to immigrants for a definite period, not from any feeling
of animosity to the Jewish race, but in order to have a period of
greater social rest . . . for the purpose of internal reconstruction"
(<i>The Times</i>, 28 February 1919, 8). On 4 April, the <i>Times</i>
reported that two million Poles were returning to their country "in a
state of complete destitution and rags" and with no possibility of work,
the Germans having carried away all the machinery (<i>The Times</i>,
4 April 1919, 11.) On 27 May, the Zionist Organization expressed in the

The Eliot-Kallen correspondence was first discovered and its importance
described by Ranen Omer. See his article "'It is I who have been defending

Correspondence," <i>Texas Studies in Literatureand Language</i> 39.4

On 22 October 1927, Eliot asked Kallen to give his regards "to your sister
whom I remember very well, though I do not suppose she will remember
me." Omer, unaware of their earlier friendship at Harvard, states in his
essay that "Eliot and Kallen began their acquaintance in the late 1920s"
(see Omer, 322), but he does not find evidence for their meeting before
Eliot lectured at the New School in 1933. Nor does he dispute the alleged
anti-Semitism of Eliot's early poetry and prose, attributing Eliot's
"late enthusiasm for diversity" to Kallen's influence from the mid-1930s:
"From the letters it is reasonable to assume that Kallen greatly enjoyed
his friendship with Eliot but also saw an unprecedented opportunity to
influence the great poet, to wean him away from an erratic anti-Semitism
that in any case showed signs of fading into the past and toward an
affirmation of the contribution Hebraism had made to world culture"
(Omer, 328).

Kallen hosted a dinner party at a New York restaurant for Eliot, Henry
and Teresa Eliot, and Horace Gregory after Eliot's poetry reading, as
recounted in Gregory's <i>The House on Jefferson Street</i> (New York:
Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971), 205-06: "To me, the reading was a
<i>tour de force</i>, quickened, I thought, by the presence of Henry
in the audience. And when Eliot preceded his reading of 'Sweeney Among
the Nightingales' by saying that the poem was like a modern painting,
abstract and impersonal, I felt that he was addressing his remarks to
Henry directly . . . I thought I saw him turn a bright flicker of a smile
in Henry's direction," as if to recognize Henry's intimate comprehension
of the surrealistic poem.

The first critic to take this position was Cleanth Brooks in "T. S. Eliot
and the American South," <i>Southern Review</i> 21 (October 1985):
"As far as his argument is concerned, <i>free-thinking</i> is
the key phrase. Thus, even the ultra-conservative Old South got
along with its God-fearing Jews very well. There was perhaps less
anti-Jewish feeling in the Old South than anywhere else in the United
States. 'Free-thinkers'&#8212;whatever the final merits of Eliot's
argument&#8212;would have been the accurate term. And if free-thinking
was the issue, whether the ancestors of the free-thinkers were of the
Jewish, Catholic or Protestant faiths would not matter" (921-22).

Letter of 10 May 1940 to John Vincent Healy, Harry Ransom Humanities
Research Center, University of Texas at Austin. Eight years earlier,
when Eliot was Norton professor at Harvard, Healy had submitted nine
pages of poems to Eliot, who responded with frank criticism on 22
November 1932 (Berg): "The faults throughout are the same, a tumid style,
generality of emotion, imprecision of image and no definite location of
anything. . . . I think that what you need at the moment is a great deal
of practice in writing simple expository and narrative prose."

<p>

This was reported many years after the event to E. H. Gombrich, who wrote
of Boas in <i>Tributes: Interpreters of Our Cultural Tradition</i>(Ithaca:
Cornell University Press, 1984): "Intolerance of any kind was and remained
anathema to him. He once told me that he had been very friendly with
T. S. Eliot, whom he had known at Harvard and who used to be a house
guest of the Boases in Baltimore, until the moment when he made a
slighting remark in a lecture about not wanting free-thinking Jews in
his ideal community. 'I can at least rid you of the company of one',
wrote George to him, and never received a reply" . Eliot never
hesitated to reply to anyone who accused him of anti-Semitism, much
less a close friend, and the accuracy of Gombrich's anecdotal account
and Eliot's alleged failure to respond remain to be seen. When Kallen
and Eliot later had occasion to discuss their mutual friend, Kallen
told Eliot on 23 March 1956 that he greatly admired Boas for having
"combined moral courage with intellectual gaiety that would stand out
anywhere, but especially among college professors." Eliot's friend
Isaiah Berlin took offense when he came across the statement in 1951,
indignantly quoting it back and questioning Eliot (see Seymour-Jones),
who replied that "the sentence of which you complain would of course
never have appeared at all . . . if I had been aware of what was going
to happen, indeed had already begun in Germany."

his commentary, and in his reply of 23 November Kallen wrote that he was
"in entire agreement with what you have said to him. It is only when
we come to definitions of 'religion,' 'culture' that our divergence
would become manifest for I am unable to think of religion as determined
primarily by the content of belief rather than by the act of believing. In
a different context my emphasis would be of the sort that Royce intended
by his word 'loyalty' and from this it would follow that I am unable to
give Judaism or Christianity the preferential position that you give
them. I take them together with all the other religions of mankind. I
recognize that each is a creed and a code to which other people are as
committed as Judaists and Christians are committed to their own creeds
and codes. . . . Perhaps the chief point of divergence between us is
that while I acquiesce in the right of others to their supernaturalism,
I do not give it a privileged position. In Royce's language, my concern
would be 'loyalty to loyalty.'" (AJA)

poetry was on Eliot's mind again because he had been invited by Ian
Parsons of Chatto and Windus to write the introduction to Rosenberg's
<i>Collected Poems</i> . Eliot had evidently agreed to write it,
but when he developed a bad cold he had to postpone a meeting to discuss
it. To meet a deadline, Parsons assigned the introduction to Siegfried
Sassoon, who also saw in Rosenberg's poems "a fruitful fusion between
English and Hebrew culture. Behind all his poetry there is a racial
quality&#8212;biblical and prophetic." See <i>The Collected Poems of

When my <i>Eliot's Dark Angel</i> (Oxford, 1999) was reviewed in
(September 2001), I was criticized for not
addressing Eliot's alleged anti-Semitism and for leaving my opposition
to the motives, methods, and conclusions of Anthony Julius's book couched
in an endnote, where I stated that, when restricted materials eventually
become available, a full scholarly investigation would require "a book
length study rather than a chapter . . . and a larger context than Julius
and previous critics have provided."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 The reviewer found this an injudicious way of avoiding a hotly-contested
 point and felt that I seemed



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
to be implicating not just the vituperative Eliot-haters, but an
entire lineup of scholars&#8212;many of them more respectable than
Julius, and who have been quite sympathetic to Eliot's oeuvre as a
whole&#8212;who have been justifiably troubled by the anti-Semitic
imagery found there. I'm skeptical that buried in some archive there
exists a trump card that will decisively recuperate those poems that
represent, in however problematized, ironic, or distanced a fashion,
the Jew as unassimilable, greedy, disgusting, dangerous, conniving.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
In the otherwise generous review, I was dismayed only by that series of
adjectives with which the reviewer confirmed the widespread view of the
way Eliot portrays the Jew in his poems. Thus, when I wrote "Burbank with
a Baedeker, Eliot with a Cigar," I determined to respond to this criticism
by  reconstructing the lost biographical and historical context of the
1918-19 poems and the 1933 lectures that became <i>After Strange Gods</i>,

<b></b>

and by  bringing the recently discovered Kallen correspondence to
bear on the issue, providing a sample of the archival material that is
just beginning to surface. I made a deliberate decision not to cite Ricks
or Julius or any of the scores of critics who have brought anti-Semitic
charges against Eliot, for I wanted to bring to the table a considerable
amount of new material in a non-argumentative essay, knowing full well
that my academic audience was familiar with the conflict, if not all
the combatants. I did realize, however, that its publication would
provoke responses and opinions that would resist my arguments and
interpretations. So on the occasion of its publication with invited
responses, I am grateful for this opportunity to enter into dialogue
with this group of scholars, whom I thank for their time and attention,
even in disagreement. I begin my reply with respect and in the spirit of
"sporting fellowship"  in which Eliot and Kallen conducted their
cultural arguments.

<p>
Whatever the value of my interpretations and conclusions in the essay,
the surfacing of Eliot's correspondence with Kallen is of major import,
bringing a seismic shift of ground to what is dryly termed "the discourse
of anti-Semitism" and my primary disappointment is that my respondents,
in defending and reiterating their previous positions and attitudes, pay
little service to its likely impact on Eliot and modernist studies. The
correspondence is pushed to the side of argument by a general insistence
on Eliot's alleged anti-Semitism and a refusal to accept evidence
that religion and not race is the issue in Eliot's writing. Thus, the
placement of this neglected material into debate requires an historical
context for some of our readers.

<p>
For over fifty years, since scholars such as Lionel Trilling and
Stanley Edgar Hyman began to break the silence about the seemingly
anti-Semitic stance of Eliot's early poems and later prose, there has
been precious little material added to the increasingly aggressive
dialogue&#8212;a letter here, an anecdote there, a memoir, and so
on&#8212;the evidence repeatedly rehashed like a Prufrockian "argument
of insidious intent." George Bornstein and Ronald Bush brought the theme
into the 70s and 80s, but Christopher Ricks was the first to synthesize
the record of complaints and examine the nature of Eliot's prejudice
and anti-Semitism in a probing book-length study, <i>T. S. Eliot and
Prejudice</i> , which provoked much debate in the papers.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Though Ricks unhesitatingly delineated what he perceived to be the ugly
 touches of anti-Semitism in Eliot's work, he pointed to the mitigating
 lines of apparent regret for "things ill done and done to others' harm"
 in "Little Gidding" as evidence of Eliot's redemptive remorse in his
 later art. But when Julius published <i>T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism,
 and Literary Form</i> in 1995, he made it clear that Ricks had not gone
 far enough, discrediting any motive of redemption. Julius described the
 book as an "honourable attempt" to engage with Eliot's anti-Semitism
 but ultimately a failure, because it does not ask "<i>how</i> Eliot
 is an anti-Semite" (<i>EASLF</i>, 10), a question that Julius went on
 to answer with a vengeance. Julius's book subsequently redoubled the
 debate that Ricks's book had brought seven years earlier, and while
 some reviewers deplored the courtroom tactics and reverse sophistry of
 his methods, based on the formula "I censure; I do not wish to censor"
 (<i>EASLF</i>, 40), many others applauded, recommended, and adopted it
 as a textbook, one with the startling thesis that out of his virulent
 anti-Semitism Eliot made

<b></b>

great art. It was a thesis that tempered relentless censure and
adversarial readings with aesthetic praise, a seemingly plausible and
generous-minded thesis that, whether true or not, academics could carry
respectably to students in the classroom and profess confidently to
the reading public in print. The book unleashed a new, intemperate,
sometimes gloating climate in discussions of Eliot, with Tom Paulin
leading the way by declaring in his review-essay that Julius's book
"is only the beginning of a long process of revisionist criticism which
should diminish the overwhelming, the stifling cultural authority which
Eliot's oeuvre has acquired."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 After reading Eliot for thirty years and teaching him for twenty,
 writes Paulin, he had come to see, with Julius's help, that "there
 is a malignity in it which is terrifying. It's so firm and so quiet,
 because like a true politician Eliot never apologises and he never
 explains." (Of course, the terrifying irony of these remarks lies in
 Paulin's own malignant remarks, protested by the Board of Deputies of
 British Jews, that "Brooklyn-born" Jewish settlers in Israel "should
 be shot dead." Paulin, too, "never apologises," and as reported in the
 <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, "he vehemently denied allegations that he was
 anti-semitic, citing his anger at the way the anti-semitism of TS Eliot,
 addressed in a study by Anthony Julius, had been ignored."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>) At the same time, the new Professor of Poetry at Oxford, James Fenton,
influenced by Julius and Paulin, said in his lecture on "Eliot vs. Julius"
that Eliot was an anti-Semitic "scoundrel," stirring his Oxford audience
to applause. Describing Julius's "remarkable" book, he declared that
"Whatever assessment is made of Eliot in the future, the Julius book
will have to come into it." Fenton went on to say that the book was a
"rebuke," and that "the rebuke to Eliot can also be felt as a rebuke
to the reader to the extent that in our reading of him we deny what is
lamentably there. Julius says an anti-Semite is a scoundrel. What is it
that holds us back from saying that Eliot was a scoundrel?"
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 In this free-for-all climate, and on this platform, a number of critics
 have since rushed in to deepen Julius's indictment.

<p>
This spring we are promised the second edition of Julius's influential
book, where we must anticipate even further scrutiny of Eliot's
personal transgressions and literary anti-Semitism, and even more
critical approbation. The appearance of the Eliot-Kallen correspondence,
however, revealing a sustained and cordial dialogue between Eliot the
conservative, believing Christian and Kallen the liberal, free-thinking
Jew on the relation of race, religion, humanism and culture, could
not be more untimely or unwelcome for that event. The manner in which
Julius makes light of that material in his present response indicates
the way that we may expect him to incorporate awareness of it in the new
edition. Though he claims that I do not "do enough with the relationship
to make it interesting" , what does strike his interest about the
friendship, as indeed it must (he is "glad to learn of it" [42]), is
that "Eliot responded to Kallen's pleas on behalf of the German-Jewish
intelligentsia" . But in presenting the crucial instances of Eliot
seeking assistance for Jewish refugees before and during World War II,
activities that have never been part of the discourse and that surely
will be an astonishing revelation to most readers, I am seen to give
undue attention: "Schuchard talks it up somewhat" .

<b></b>

<p>
This brief overview shows the climate of receptivity in which I have
asked the reader to reconsider these charges against Eliot and in which
the responses to my arguments have arrived. It is interesting that Julius
begins his response by asserting that his book has had little success
or impact, claiming all too modestly that "There is immense resistance
to the simple truth that Eliot wrote anti-Semitic poems. I do not think
that the book has done very much to weaken this resistance" . To
illustrate this claim, he quotes Barbara Everett's recent article in
which she attributes the assailing of Eliot's reputation and the gradual
collapse of his cultural authority to "a discovered or imputed misogyny
and anti-semitism" . These arguments, she believes, are largely
"rationalisations for changes of cultural climate and mere fashion. Eliot
remains the superb (if highly individual) poet he always was" . To
dismiss Everett's argument, which implicitly includes Julius, Paulin,
Fenton and their followers among Eliot's assailants, Julius constructs
a sequence of logic that is not hers and ascribes it to her as "slack
reasoning, conducted at that low level at which the object is not
so much to refute an argument as to identify a discreditable motive"
. If Julius occasionally finds a critic like Everett who demurs
from the "simple truth" of his thesis, he must be pleased to discover
that all his fellow respondents but Donoghue express views similar to
his. Donoghue, who says he has never believed that Eliot was anti-Semitic,
is much more cynical than Everett in attributing the assault on Eliot to
an anti-Christian, anti-moralist animus in an academic profession that
can only bring down a re of Eliot's stature with slander. There is
plenty of slander about, and in its midst Julius has already found a
place for Donoghue, whom he characterizes as the kind of reader "whose
indifference to the poems' anti-Semitism makes him complicit in it"
(<i>EASLF</i>, 39). Julius confers the same distinction not only on the
likes of me but on Jewish critics such as Wolf Mankowitz, Jeffrey Perl,
Danny Karlin, and Gabriel Josipovici, former editor of the <i>Jewish
Chronicle</i>, none of whom consider Eliot to be anti-Semitic. He offers
patronizing explanations for their denial and informs us that "There is
a small history to be written of Jewish critics' insensibility to the
anti-Semitism of anti-Semitic works of literature" (<i>EASLF</i>, 49).
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
I have long admired Marjorie Perloff's extraordinary contribution to the
study of modern and contemporary literature, and I had the privilege
this past September of hearing her moving lecture on "Gerontion" for
her T. S. Eliot Memorial Lecture in St. Louis. She argued there, as
she states in her response, that "the notorious passage in 'Gerontion,'. . . obviously anti-Semitic as it appears when taken out of context,
must be understood within the frame of the entire poem" , and she
went on to construct a context in terms of Eliot's personal life and the
war, similar to the context that I establish, that led to a powerful,
much-applauded reading. I could only wish that she had brought more of
this new reading to her response, and I can only regret that when she
turns from the youthful poet to the older cultural critic her feelings
of resentment are so strong that they lead her to seemingly reverse
that reading of "Gerontion." In the language of Julius, whose book
she cites at the outset as arguing the anti-Semitic case against Eliot
"most forcefully" , she states that "From 'Prufrock' to <i>The Waste
Land</i>, Eliot's poetry is nasty, cruel, painful," identifying the Jew
as one of the "hated

<b></b>

others" of the poet's persona, who spits out the verb "fought" in what
is described as "a moment of self-disgust" . Her confident belief
in what Eliot knew of Hitler's activities in the spring of 1933 when he
was writing <i>After Strange Gods</i>, a belief shared by others and a
factor of her anger, I shall address below.

<p>
David Bromwich, certainly one of the most discerning critics of romantic
and modern literature writing today, begins his response by summarizing
what he takes my essay to establish "beyond a doubt" , and one of
these is that Eliot looked at Jews "as a scattering of unaffiliated
individuals, part of the urban human debris which he scorned and
feared and out of which he made poetry" . No, my essay establishes
nothing of the kind; this is the thesis that Julius and others wish to
establish and one that Bromwich, in a surprising misrepresentation,
attributes to me. Thereafter he echoes several of Julius's themes in
refuting my position, including the description of Gerontion's body as
being "marked and scabbed by a loathsome disease" , a disease that
"will be taken by many readers as a metaphor for a corruption that the
man as a type exhibits" . Julius has found a new metaphor for the
Eliot-imposed affliction on the Jews, "badges of disease" , in his
own response. This novel interpretation, developed by Julius at length
in his book, that there is "a sinister hint of leprosy in 'Gerontion'"
leads to a far-reaching, condemnatory logic:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Stigmatising Jews as lepers is an ancient, persistent
calumny. . . . Lepers are weak but dangerous, and they form separate
communities. They are thus analogous to the Jews of an anti-Semitic
imagination. Such an imagination routinely turns analogy into identity:
Jews
<i>become</i>
lepers. Eliot reworked the calumny, repeated so often that it became not
just an accusation but the way in which Jews were routinely characterised,
and he incorporated it into one of his finest poems. (
<i>EASLF</i>, 48-49)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From a "sinister hint" to a sweeping conclusion, this is the way the
circuitous prosecutorial logic of Julius works, and it is surprising to
find the usually judicious Bromwich adopting it. Gerontion's "loathsome
disease" is much less the tenor of the poem than Eliot's sympathy with
the Jews who fled Antwerp and Brussels for London during the terrible
German occupation of World War I, and their blistered, patched, and
peeled bodies were more reasonably and likely afflicted by exposure to
severely-blistering mustard gas&#8212;first used by the Germans with
devastating skin and respiratory effects in Belgium, at the first battle
of Ypres&#8212;than by any imagined leprosy of an ancient calumny.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Bush and Longenbach, too, have adopted versions of Julius's thesis that
Eliot's anti-Semitism is an integral part of his finest poems, arguing
respectively that Eliot creates "dangerous" and "provocative" art out
of his anti-Semitic animus. In citing Julius at the beginning of his
response, and in identifying me as one among those admirers of Eliot
who have "ached" to repair the "damage" of Julius's view of Eliot's
sometimes civil, generally offensive attitude toward Jews, Bush sets
out to weaken my "one-sided"  defence. Like Julius, Bush has made
anti-Semitism part and parcel of modernism and has constructed a critical
view on that premise. He cannot entertain the idea of a philo-Semitism
for Eliot because it would make the man "a less interesting re than

<b></b>

he was"  as an anti-Semite, and the game of his art less
dangerous. Because Bush believes that "Eliot thought in terms of race"
, a widely-held belief disproven in the Kallen correspondence, it
is not possible for him to find other than disingenuous my argument that
Eliot's notorious prose statement is an anti-free-thinking statement and
not an anti-Semitic statement, for he believes that Eliot's references to
freethinking serve to give his Jewish stereotypes "a heavier unconscious
charge" .

<p>
To Longenbach, Eliot is a "conflicted"  poet and critic, sometimes
capable of a manipulative prejudice against Jews, women, homosexuals,
and national types like the Irish, and sometimes capable of an admiration
that "did not necessarily dismantle the structure of his prejudice"
. He, too, believes that Eliot's prejudices are essential to the
poems, that together with the language and syntax they give the poems
their provocative power; indeed, sometimes the combination is so powerful
that the poem invites us "to call him a bigot" . Well, maybe so; many
readers have done just that, and continue to do it, but that does not
mean that we as critics should rest with the certainty of that bigotry,
or build a critical construct on it. It is the work of scholarship not to
lessen the power of a poem but to lessen the ambiguity which encompasses
it, to move closer to distinguishing what is "intensely serious" from what
is "merely disgusting." Finally, I must question Longenbach's constructed
analogy that Eliot's anti-feminist prejudice against "Precocia Pondoeuf"
is essential to his praise of Isaac Rosenberg. If it is so easy to find
examples of Eliot's prejudices against women, homosexuals and Jews,
one wishes that Longenbach would find an actual woman writer for this
formula rather than an imagined caricature like Precocia: a satire on the
public's preference for sentimental poetastery in the popular magazines,
yes; misogyny, no.

<p>
These are some of the critical positions and attitudes at work in this
debate, as I see them, and the basis for the challenges to my own. As I
do not have space to address all the criticism (some forget that I have
written a lecture-essay, not a book), I want to address two critical
matters that concern most respondents: the question of what Eliot "knew"
in 1933 and the assertion that his Jewish friendships are dismissible
as part of an inadmissible, "some of my best friends are Jews" argument.

<p>
Readers of this debate may profit, as I have, from returning to Michael
Andr&eacute; Bernstein's compelling article in the first issue of
, "Foregone Conclusions: Narrating the
Fate of Austro-German Jewry," in which he describes the dangers of
foreshadowing and backshadowing, and the importance of sideshadowing,
in the construction of historical narratives of human catastrophe.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 His distinctions help us analyze and address those "foregone
 conclusions" that attend upon the backshadowing that imposes the
 Holocaust upon Eliot's early poems as a context for them, upon the
 foreshadowing that follows upon our knowledge of events subsequent to
 those poems. Bernstein provides from historical and critical studies
 some startling examples of fallacious techniques similar to Julius's
 statement in his response that "The 'clever Jew undergraduate mind' of
 1915 will become the 'free-thinking Jew' of 1933" . The importance
 of sideshadowing, which accounts for singular events and decisions
 outside the main events of historical movement, is that it "refuses
 the tyranny of all synthetic master schemes; it rejects the conviction
 that a particular code, law, or

<b></b>

pattern exists, waiting to be uncovered beneath the heterogeneity of human
existence" and it stresses "the absence of any predictive certainties
in human affairs" ("FC," 58). The discretion that sideshadowing
is concerned to teach us, writes Bernstein, "is  not to see the
future as preordained; and, as a direct corollary,  not to use our
knowledge of the future as a means of judging the decisions of those
living before that (still only possible) future has become actual event"
("FC," 61). When foreshadowing and backshadowing displace the reality of
individual situations with historical patterns, the resultant narratives
"substitute an often intolerable, even if unintended, superiority shared
by author and reader over the heads, as it were, of the book's subjects"
("FC," 61). Bernstein's theory of historical narrative applies not only to
the history of Austro-German Jewry but to the debate over Eliot's alleged
anti-Semitism generally and to the problem of what he "must have known"
in 1933 particularly.

<p>
"While Schuchard is ready to infer Eliot's familiarity with newspaper
reports of attacks on Jews in early 1919," writes Julius, "he swallows
whole Eliot's bland excuse . . . for the 'unfortunate statement'
in <i>After Strange Gods</i>, that it would not have been made if he
had been aware of what was happening in Germany" . Perloff, too,
complains that "Eliot's claim that he had been unaware 'of what was
going to happen, indeed had already begun, in Germany' in 1933 strikes
me as quite disingenuous" . After recounting in detail the sequence
of events that occurred in Germany that winter and spring, she declares
that "All this was done quite openly and was reported by the newspapers
throughout Europe and the U.S." . "What then," she asks "does Eliot
mean when he says he didn't know what was happening in Germany? If he
read the newspapers at all, he did 'know.' And even if he didn't 'know'
in the spring of 33, what about the interval between delivery of the
lectures and their publication by Faber &amp; Faber in 1934?" 
These are valid questions that seem to answer themselves in the light
of backshadowing&#8212;"Of course he knew"&#8212;but in the light of
sideshadowing a different reality is revealed.

<p>
I am thus thankful to Julius for re-directing our attention to Andrew
Sharf's <i>The British Press and the Jews under Nazi Rule</i> 
and to my colleague Deborah Lipstadt's <i>Beyond Belief: The American
Press and the Coming of the Holocaust</i> , though I wonder how
closely Julius has examined them. Both books were motivated by their
authors' need to question the assumption that the British and American
public must have known through the press about the sequence of events
in Germany that led to the holocaust. Lipstadt's book had its origin



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
in a challenge hurled at me by a student a number of years ago. I had just
told my class that during the Nazi years, detailed information regarding
the destruction of European Jewry was available to the Allies. 'It was no
secret,' I proclaimed. From amidst the mass of students came an almost
angry voice: 'But what did the public&#8212;not just the people in high
places&#8212;know? How much of this information reached them? Could my
parents, who read the paper every day, have known?' I began to argue
that given all the public declarations, international conferences,
and government-authorized information which was released they could
have known a great deal. Furthermore, I contended, we had reporters in
Germany until America entered the war. They transmitted information on

<b></b>

Nazism, and that certainly contained information regarding persecution
of the Jews. 'No,' my student responded, 'I can't believe people could
have read about all this in their daily papers.'"
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This exchange led Lipstadt into a thorough investigation of how American
newspapers covered events in Germany from Hitler's accesion to power in
January 1933 through the end of World War II. In January 1933, Eliot
was on a reading and lecturing tour of American cities, returning to
Harvard in February to teach his course on contemporary literature,
to complete his Norton lectures, and to begin writing his Page-Barbour
lectures (<i>After Strange Gods</i>) for delivery at the University of
Virginia in early May. In her examination of coverage and attitudes of
the American press, Lipstadt shows that reports of the persecution of
Jews did not begin to show up, and only in scattered American papers,
until March and April, and even then "the persecution of the Jews
constituted only one small segment of the story of Nazi Germany and was
never the central theme of the reports about the new regime. . . . Rarely
was the news of the persecution of the Jews handled by journalists,
particularly by those who viewed the situation from the safety of the
United States, as an inherent expression of Nazism" (<i>BB</i>, 15). The
American press was generally skeptical of any reports of atrocities
that came in during the spring of 1933. "Rather than exaggerate,"
writes Lipstadt, "American correspondents actually made a concerted
effort to modulate the tone of their reports so as not to be accused
of fomenting hysteria"(<i>BB</i>, 20). Moreover, as reports came in,
Secretary of State Cordell Hull "pressured the press to adopt a 'spirit
of moderation' and suggested to reporters that conditions in Germany may
not have been 'accurately' and 'authoritatively' reported" (<i>BB</i>,
20). As Lipstadt frequently observes, the exaggerated and sensational
"atrocity reports" of Jewish persecutions during and after World War
I, which Eliot followed, ironically influenced the under-reporting of
persecutions from 1933 well into World War II.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 In light of these unexpected revelations about the American press's
 and government's suppression of reports and reporting, we see that
 Eliot would have been as unaware and uninformed as the vast majority of
 American citizens about the policies and atrocities of the new regime
 when he sat down to write his Page-Barbour lectures.

<p>
After Eliot sailed home to England in June 1933, he spent the summer at
Pikes Farm, Frank Morely's country home in Surrey, where, in isolation
from his wife Vivien while their Deed of Separation was being drawn up,
he went to work at once on preparing his Norton and Page-Barbour lectures
for publication. As he revealed to Paul Elmer More, in the first part
of the summer he concentrated on the Norton lectures for publication in
the autumn, and then he turned to the Page-Barbour lectures, completing
them before November for publication in February 1934.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 What British papers would Eliot have been reading at Pikes Farm? <i>The
 Times</i>? As Sharf's study shows, there was no more likelihood that
 Eliot would have read of the persecutions or known of German policies
 during the summer or autumn in England either. The British press,
 Sharf reveals, reflected some of the same skepticism and evasion as
 the American press. <i>The Times</i>"had as strong a tradition of
 restraint and a distaste for anything

<b></b>

savouring of 'sensationalism' in politics as in journalism. Its main
concern was with the consequences, for Britain and for Europe, of this
highly unrestrained German upheaval."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 At the beginning of 1934, only the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> devoted
 a significant review to events in Germany of the previous year, while
 the annual review of <i>The Times</i> "did not include much more than
 a reference."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 In light of these disclosures, it is not only reasonable but fair
 to rescind previous foregone conclusions and grant that Eliot told
 the truth when he said he was unaware "of what was going to happen,
 indeed had already begun, in Germany"  when he sent <i>After
 Strange Gods</i> to press in the autumn of 1933. As described in my
 essay, when Eliot received in Kallen's letter of 27 December, 1933,
 a circular about the new International League for Academic Freedom,
 together with Kallen's request to help find analogous groups in England
 to "focus at once on calling attention to the thousands of teachers
 and men of science in concentration camps" , Eliot complied at once
 by writing to A. L. Rowse at Oxford. As there are no references to the
 German situation in Eliot's accessible correspondence to date, Kallen's
 circular and letter probably provided Eliot with his first serious
 awareness or reliable confirmation of German policies toward the Jews.

<p>
Donoghue could not have been more prophetic in his statement that my
delineation of Eliot's Jewish friendships "is not going to count" 
with my critics, who chastise me for attempting to mitigate Eliot's
alleged anti-Semitism through them. For Bush, the friendships are "not,
after all, enough" to discharge Eliot's racial mode of thinking; for
Bromwich, they do not in any way dispose of "the moral and political
charge that he took a mischievous interest in 'the Jews'" ; to
Perloff, who maintains that my portrayal of the friendships shows that
for Eliot "Jews remain Jews first, individuals later" , my decision
to include them amounts to another invalid instance of the old "some of
my best friends are Jews" argument; and, finally, Julius has no doubt
"whether even the least sophisticated of contemporary anti-Semites would
now think it possible to get away with such a statement" . In this
heavy resistance, Eliot's casual friendship with the American Jew, Max
Bodenheim, and Eliot's identification of him as a Jew in his letters is
made a matter of racial politics and stereotypes. It is not mentioned,
however, that Eliot took a serious interest in him, advised him, and was
"anxious to help him" (<i>L</i>, 401), thereby exercising the lifelong
pattern of behavior toward Jews that is remarkably illustrated in the
Kallen correspondence and elsewhere. But for some critics the cumulative
and persistent power of ambiguous words in Eliot's allusions to Jews
in his poems and prose negates all generous actions towards his Jewish
friends. The once-positive adage that actions speak louder than words
becomes willfully reversed. "Eliot practiced better than he preached"
, writes Bromwich. "Unfortunately, it is worse in some ways to preach
than to practice tolerance. You do more harm than good in proportion as
your words outrun your actions" , a feeling echoed by Julius: "It
would appear that Eliot mostly confined his anti-Semitism to his work,
and committed himself in his private life to cordial relations with
Jews. It might have been better&#8212;for Jews, at least&#8212;if it
had been the other way around" . It is this deep-seated skepticism
and animus regarding Eliot's sincere Jewish friendships that ironically
makes it necessary to bring the friendship issue to the center of this

<b></b>

debate, if only to redress the heavily weighted use of other friendships
against him by his critics.

<p>
Christopher Ricks had earlier pointed to the eventual necessity of
addressing Eliot's friendships in quoting one of Eliot's many statements
that he was "not an anti-Semite" and that he considered it "a terrible
slander on a man" (<i>EAP</i>, 61). Ricks observed that "In due time,
there will be enough known of Eliot's friendships and of his behaviour
for there to be some confidence of humane judgment." But when Ricks
then quotes Leonard Woolf's statement&#8212;made many years after the
time of his own friendship with Eliot and now aware of the accumulated
charges against him&#8212; that "Eliot was slightly anti-Semitic in the
vague sort of way which is not uncommon," admitting that Eliot would have
"denied it quite genuinely," Ricks revealed his own skepticism about the
possibility of arriving at humane judgment: "perhaps biographically Eliot
will not be able to hope for better than this measured distaste for his
failing in what were for him the disturbed 1920s" (<i>EAP</i>, 62).

<p>
In the meantime, how perfectly legitimate and correct it has been for
critics to show Eliot guilty of anti-Semitism by his association with
such friends as Charles Maurras, Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, John Quinn,
Major Douglas, and many others. Though Julius has stated that "neither
his anti-Semitic friends nor his prose anti-Semitism should be mixed
up with his poetry," he did not hesitate to revisit T. S. Matthews'
unreliable portrayal of Eliot's visit with the Jewish writer Sarah
Gertrude Millin in South Africa.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 Julius quotes Matthews' concocted dialogue between Eliot and Millin,
 to the effect that she asked Eliot to leave her home when he admitted
 to writing "The Jew is underneath the lot," and uses it as a damaging,
 frontispiece epigraph for his book, disingenuously tucking in an endnote
 the fact that the unsubstantiated episode with Millin, an avowed South
 African racist, may be "at best, a melodramatic and telescoped version
 of the truth" (<i>EASLF</i>, 219).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Louis Menand, in his laudatory review of Julius's book, states that
 "Eliot's inability to dissociate himself from men whose anti-Semitism
 was virulent and overt was lifelong."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Menand then lines up several of the usual res (Maurras, Douglas,
 Quinn) to imply the contagion of anti-Semitism through association. "I
 don't think Eliot ever wished any harm to the Jews," Menand generously
 admits. "But he took support from and gave support to many people
 who did. He was a traveler in that terrible fellowship." Such misuse
 of biographical criticism has had such a disturbing effect on some
 teachers during the past six years that they no longer teach Eliot's
 poetry in the classroom.

<p>
As long as it incriminates, this sort of "terrible fellowship" criticism
passes muster, but not the "sporting fellowship" of Eliot's relationships
with dozens of Jewish intellectuals. Such accounts do not mention that
Eliot, whose repect for an aspect of Maurras' thought was influential
in his conversion, also found other aspects of Maurras's thought
"exasperating" and "deplorable."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 They do not relate that, after 1936, Eliot strongly resisted Pound's
 anti-Semitism, that, in 1940, when J. V. Healy complained to Eliot
 about Pound's anti-Semitism, alluding to Eliot's own "tendencies in
 this direction," Eliot replied that "As for Mr. Pound, I have already
 made it clear that I do not associate myself with any of his opinions
 about Jews. I am no longer in a position to communicate

<b></b>

with him."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Nor do they include the fact that in a letter to Pound on 13 August,
 1954, Eliot "let fly one furious rebuff to the effect that, although
 Pound was at liberty to continue with personal insults, Eliot would
 tolerate no further insult either to his nationality or to his religion,
 which included the Jewish religion."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Such selective critical indictments and exclusions make it imperative
 that we bring the full record of Eliot's Jewish friendships to the
 record of debate in the pursuit of balanced scholarship and humane
 judgment.

<p>
I call forth again some of Eliot's Jewish friends that I have described
in the essay: Leonard Woolf, John Rodker, Sidney and Violet Schiff,
Ada Leverson, Jacob Isaacs, Mark Gertler, George Boas, Horace Kallen,
Benjamin Cardozo, Henry Sherek, Isaiah Berlin, Karl Mannheim, Adolph
L&ouml;we, Alfred J. Marrow, John Amon, Edward Dahlberg, Victor Gollancz,
Groucho Marx, not to include his great admiration of the poetry of Isaac
Rosenberg and the two French Jewish poets, Ephraim Mikha&euml;l and Henri
Franck. Why is my essay the first to show Eliot in the company of an
Anglo-Jewish community in London, the first to show that Rodker and Schiff
were the Jewish editors and publishers of Eliot's allegedly anti-Semitic
poems, and that he actively sought their advice and criticism when he sent
the manuscripts to them? Why are these and other important res and
relationships missing from the works of Julius and other critics? None of
Eliot's Jewish friendships or admirations is insignificant or unrevealing;
they all matter; they all count. They fail to count only to those critics
who wish to close the debate and scholarship and proceed with "the
discourse of anti-Semitism" on the presumed fact of Eliot's guilt. Not
to count them is not only a disservice to Eliot and a distortion of
our understanding of his life and work, but a diminishment of the many
distinguished Jews who befriended him. Are we to see Kallen, Mannheim,
L&ouml;we, Gollancz, and Marx as Eliot's gullible dupes, his Jewish
Uncle Toms, to be included with Josipovici, Karlin, Mankowitz, and Perl
in Julius's unwritten history of Jews who denied the simple truth about
Eliot? And what about the many Jewish friends and correspondents that
I have not included, and about whom we know very little, such as Martin
Buber, Will Herberg, and the New York booksellers, Margie and Louis Cohn,
close friends for many years?
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 And what of Eliot's Jewish friends who are still alive, who still
 cherish the friendship, and who live in dismay at the academic industry
 that has grown up around his alleged anti-Semitism? They all count, and
 will be counted; they are members of a lifelong pattern of significant
 intellectual friendships with Eliot, and collectively those friendships,
 and Eliot's actions within them, reveal him to be more a philo-Semite
 than an anti-Semite.

<p>
The pace of Eliot scholarship is extremely slow, in part because of the
inaccessibility of massive amounts of correspondence and other materials
needed to clear away the many ambiguities and uncertainties that cloud
literary interpretation and humane judgment. Thus, the surfacing of the
Eliot-Kallen correspondence comes as a major, unexpected windfall in
this slow process, thanks to Ranen Omer, the young Jewish scholar who
unearthed it, perceived its importance, and brought it to our attention.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 I am, indeed, as Julius says, "excited"  by it; it opens up the
 debate again at a time when debate is being closed.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 Meanwhile, the process of criticism moves apace, and

<b></b>

stakes will be claimed. What is at stake, in the way that we conduct
the discourse of Eliot's alleged anti-Semitism, is the integrity of
scholarship and the presentation of it to students and the public. If the
process of rigorous humanistic scholarship eventually proves me wrong,
so be it. It's worth the risk.

See George Bornstein, <i>Transformations of Romanticism in Yeats,
Eliot, and Stevens</i> (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press,
1976), 149-50, and Ronald Bush, <i>T. S. Eliot: Character and Style</i>
(New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), 225-26. Where earlier critics
focused on the alleged anti-Semitism of Eliot's early poems, Bush focuses
on the "fierce and uncomfortable theodicy" of <i>Four Quartets</i>,
which he finds to be "the child of a very dark embryo indeed . . . shot
through with technical and emotional lapses that cannot be denied"
. Bush is reluctant to bring to his argument the "perhaps" anonymous
review in the <i>Criterion</i> (July 1936) of <i>The Yellow Spot</i>
, a book that documents the persecution of the Jews, a book that
provoked its unsympathetic reviewer to ask why the Jews in Germany,
"among all the unfortunates of the world, have a first claim on our
compassion and help." But Bush goes ahead on his assumption that it
is Eliot's review and states that it "seems to bare the displaced and
disturbed anger of 'Little Gidding"s terrible impatience with those who
would exaggerate the world's 'claim on our compassion'" . Though
C. K. Stead in <i>Pound, Yeats, Eliot and the Modernist Movement</i>
(London: Macmillan, 1986) and Christopher Ricks in <i>T.S. Eliot and
Prejudice</i> (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press,
1988; henceforth abbreviated as <i>EAP</i>) had reservations about
Eliot's authorship, they still brought the unsigned review to bear upon
their discussions; however, neither critic was as bold as Anthony Julius,
who in <i>T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form</i> (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1995; henceforth abbreviated as <i>EASLF</i>)
put aside any doubts about Eliot's authorship of the review and used it
against him in an extended, devastating analysis, attempting to cover
himself by saying that "if I am wrong [about Eliot's authorship],
then I have done him an injustice, for it is a dismal, cruel piece"
(<i>EASLF</i>, 168). When Valerie Eliot subsequently revealed in the
<i>TLS</i> (31 May 1996, 17) that the review was not by Eliot but by
Montgomery Belgion, Julius in his grudging reply in the <i>TLS</i> (14
June 1996, 17) asked, without apology, "is it satisfactory that thirty
years after Eliot's death, the resolution of such issues should still
await the whim of his executrix?" In explaining the misattribution in
a more recent letter to the <i>TLS</i> (12 July 2002, 17), Julius cites
the precedential use of the review by Stead, Ricks, and Bush and denies
a critic's implication that his use of it was "the consequence of a zeal
to condemn him [Eliot]." Though the misattribution is recorded in these
letters to the <i>TLS</i>, and though Julius will correct the error in
his second edition, the damage done to Eliot remains in all these books
for uninformed readers.

Quoted by Ian Parker, "Eliot vs. Julius," <i>New Yorker</i> (20 May
1996): 29. Lyndall Gordon, who attended Fenton's lecture, wrote in
<i>T. S. Eliot: An Imperfect Life</i> (New York and London: W. W. Norton,
1999) that Fenton "noted that Eliot never withdrew opinions that were
commonplace in 1919 but offensive after the Holocaust. For the evil of
that event could not be entirely unconnected with thinkers who fuelled
hatred. Fenton ended his lecture with the statement, 'Eliot was a
scoundrel.' After a shocked moment, people clapped. I did not" .

Julius addresses the shortcomings of Mankowitz and Perl in <i>EASLF</i>,
49-50, 58. His extended confrontation with Josipovici and Karlin appears
in his "Reflections on T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form"
in <i>ANQ</i>, 14 (Fall 1998), 43-59. "The critic Gabriel Josipovici,"
states Julius, "writing in the <i>Jewish Chronicle</i>, found me
'oversensitive' about Eliot's anti-Semitism. There is a small history

<b></b>

to be written of the occasions when minorities have been criticized
for 'oversensitivity,' and Josipovici will have his small place in it"
. Josipovici is guilty of what Julius calls the "aesthetic fallacy"
that many Jewish readers of Eliot commit: "The Jew can demonstrate
his superiority to the insult by refusing to be offended, treating the
provocation as an instance of the aesthetic. . . . Indifference to the
offense given by Eliot's anti-Semitic poetry is, among other things,
a failure of interpretation" . Here the reader will also find
definitions and illustrations of the "biographical fallacy" and other
categories of misinterpretation employed in his present response.

The cutaneous symptoms of the leprosy bacillus include hard nodular lumps
under the skin, not blisters. Kingsley Martin, serving on an ambulance
train, described a German breakthrough in the great 1918 <i>putsch</i>:
"It was our first experience of mustard gas. The men we took were
covered in blisters. The size of your palm most of them. In any tender,
warm place, under the arms, between the legs, and over the face and
neck." (<i>Father res</i> [London: Hutchinson, 1966], 83).If we
follow the predominant historical context and logic of Eliot's images,
the resettled Jewish refugee in "Gerontion," blistered by poisonous gas
in Belgium, has been bandaged ("patched") and healed ("peeled") in London.

See Lipstadt, <i>BB</i>, 8-9: "The Belgian atrocity reports of World

use of poison gas, the brutal killings of babies, and mutilations
of defenseless women in Belgium all turned out to be products of the
imagination. But these stories left their legacy. During World War II,
even when reporters possessed proof of mass killings they doubted they
had occurred because the stories seemed too similar to the false reports
of the previous war." See also 17, 137, 188, 240.

Though Julius notes that he had read about Millin's "own noxious
racism" in J. M. Coetzee's <i>White Writing: On the Culture of Letters
in South Africa</i> (New Haven and London: Yale University Press,
1988), he conveniently omits Coetzee's revelation (160-61) that her
biological argument for racial inferiority&#8212;targeted at black
Africans&#8212;duplicated that of Nazi scientists and that "the Nazi
sensibility found her horror of blood-mingling congenial." Thus,
ironically, though she was anti-Nazi and refused permission for her
racist, anti-Negro novels to be published in German translation, one
was pirated "and read widely in Germany as a <i>Rassenroman</i>." As
Coetzee concludes, "I have linked her with the Nazis and have suggested
that it was their fate to be discredited together." Julius's omission
thus renders hollow his subsequent urging in his text that "Eliot's
anti-Semitic poems demand literary analysis, and that analysis must be
informed by something of Sarah Millin's outrage." Eliot had written to
William Turner Levy before the journey to South Africa with friends that
he needed "some better climate (though not so far away or so expensive
a journey as South Africa, nor do I wish to go to a country with such
unhappy race problems)." Quoted in William Turner Levy and Victor Scherle,

William Turner Levy, describing his gratitude to Eliot for introducing him
to the work of Simone Weil, for whose <i>The Need for Roots</i> 
Eliot had written the introduction, writes that Eliot "was pleased that
I shared his admiration for her ideas, and added, 'Another great mind
is, as you probably know, that of Martin Buber. I felt his undeniable
greatness the first time I met him, a thing I do not often feel.' I
agreed with Eliot that <i>I and Thou</i> was the most significant book for
Christians by this Jewish theologian, and that it had a profound effect
on modern religious thought." See Levy and Scherle, <i>Affectionately,
T. S. Eliot</i>, 39.

<a name="FOOT22" href="#REF22">22</a>.
See 24. Omer calls on future critics to employ the Kallen material in
reevaluating the thesis of Julius, who "would like to persuade a new
generation of readers that Eliot's socially sanctioned anti-Semitism
remained an emotionally held belief that was not only a prime undercurrent
throughout what he considers Eliot's greatest work, but a position he
never recanted, even after the Holocaust. Besides the dubious literary
value of his investigations into Eliot's anti-Semitism (he wants to rescue
the poetry from 'banality'), his approach is limited in its overemphasis
on the earlier poetry. The controversy occurs because Julius often
overstates his case in order to repeat (again and again) his claim that
Eliot's greatest poetry is sustained by his hostility toward Jews. The
reality is more intricate than what this tautological certitude implies"
(Omer, "It Is I Who Have Been Defending a Religion Called Judaism," 321).

<p>
<a name="FOOT23" href="#REF23">23</a>.
The bell of closure was loudly rung by the influential critic Louis
Menand, who declared in "Eliot and the Jews" that Julius's views of
Eliot's anti-Semitic poetry and prose are "unassailable: they are poetry,
and they are anti-Semitic, and the two qualities are inseparable, for
the poems have a place within a very specific tradition of anti-Semitic
literary thought. His claim that anti-Semitism casts a shadow on Eliot's
writing after 1922 is right as well. And in the end, even his refusal
to concede ground to exculpatory arguments seems just. For indifference
is not a defense" .

<p>
"There's never been a womans autobiography. Nothing to compare with
Rousseau," Virginia Woolf lamented a few months before her death.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 She blamed the inhibitions created by a lifelong training in chastity
 and modesty and was convinced that the demons she had slain in her
 career as a novelist and critic left others that barred her from
 telling the truth about herself. If this was so, it was hardly for
 want of trying. Woolf's attempt to write what she variously called
 her memoirs or life story or autobiography or family history became
 a lifelong project, extending from her childhood through her youth,
 maturity and approaching old age, and left unfinished at her death. It
 was discontinuous&#8212;produced in discrete stages or short bursts,
 for a variety of private and public audiences, and finally addressed
 only to herself. It might be said to begin with the weekly <i>Hyde
 Park Gate News</i>, written with the help of her siblings by the
 self-consciously precocious Adeline Virginia Stephen (ages 9 to 13),
 and designed strictly for family consumption; it drew sustenance from
 the journal she began to keep at fifteen, temporarily abandoned twelve
 years later, and resumed as a diary in her mid-thirties; it produced
 the radically disjunct selections put together by Jeanne Schulkind in
 the posthumously published volume <i>Moments of Being</i>, written at
 various times from 1907 to 1940, between Woolf's 25th and 58th year;
 and it was never even close to completed.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Extraordinary claims were nevertheless made for <i>Moments of Being</i>,
especially for "A Sketch of the Past," its longest independent part
(<i>MOB</i>, 64-159). The book's original publication in 1976, thirty-five
years after Woolf's suicide, roughly coincided with the beginnings of
the contemporary women's movement and the distrust of a male-dominated
literary tradition. The collection seemed to offer a powerful alternative
to the "official story"&#8212;of Woolf's life, of women's lives as they
differed from men's, and of the assumptions of what should matter most
in autobiographical writing. Attention was focused on two incidents
recording the sexual experiments of Virginia's half-brothers on her
youthful body, and the book was treated as a sensational revelation
of childhood trauma. In <i>The Unknown Virginia Woolf</i> , the
revisionist biographer Roger Poole sees the collection as evidence of
a conspiracy of Woolf's male tormentors that as he says "clinched my
case" for the etiology of her mental breakdowns, and he predicts that
the study of her life "will take on a completely new direction."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Louise DeSalvo's <i>Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual
 Abuse on Her Life and Work</i>  treats Woolf as an incest victim,
 extrapolating much of her adult experience from the incidents recorded
 in these memoirs.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Far from seeming idiosyncratic, the experiences Woolf's autobiographical
 pieces record were often treated as representative of women's lives. In
 conjunction with her feminist discursive writing, there emerged a
 prototypical tale of victimization and resistance, what Shoshana Felman
 has called a generic "testimony" addressed to and speaking for "the
 community of women" in a "bond of reading" that "can <i>empower</i>
 women's story <i>to become a story</i> . . . only through women's
 collective perception of themselves."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
The evident need for a "woman's autobiography . . . to compare
with Rousseau" helped to make a case for the central importance of
<i>Moments of Being</i>. Avrom Fleishman's wide-ranging <i>res of
Autobiography</i> devotes a whole chapter to "A Sketch of the Past,"
a work he calls "one of the most illuminating statements on the grandeur
and misery of self-writing of which we are possessed."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 His "we" conveys an immediate canonical status, less than a decade
 after publication. Daniel Albright notes that the earliest and latest
 pieces in the collection virtually define the beginning and end of
 Woolf's career and reveal her "abiding obsession with autobiography."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 The book came to be seen as the master key to Woolf's life
 and the bedrock truth at the base of all her fictions. And
 its representativeness for a different kind of autobiographical
 writing&#8212;focused on domestic life rather than on the subject's
 achievements in the world&#8212;too easily turned it into a case study
 in writing and gender difference. It is a heavy burden for a single
 book to bear, particularly when it had not even been shaped <i>as</i>
 a book by its author, and it makes it difficult to see its separate
 parts as only some of the chapters in the whole complex history of
 Woolf's attempt to record her own story. Above all, treating these
 experimental pieces as a collective and triumphant fulfillment of
 Woolf's autobiographical ambition minimizes her restless dissatisfaction
 with the tools available to her, and her persistent methodological
 revisionism.

<p>
Although the last-written and most ambitious selection in that
volume&#8212;"A Sketch of the Past"&#8212;was a starting over from
her first memories and might, if Woolf had lived, eventually have been
published as her Memoirs, it is, I think, more fruitful to

<b></b>

consider the whole mass of her autobiographical writings as a deliberately
fragmented ongoing project, a rich archive of self-exploration and
self-disclosure and often of bafflement that Woolf collected and preserved
even though she had no intention of publishing it all, either during her
lifetime or in the future. There is a chilling final injunction to her
husband in one version of her suicide note which Leonard Woolf must have
decided to ignore: "Will you destroy all my papers" (<i>LOVW</i>, 6:487,
28 March 1941). The "papers" would have included the flood of manuscripts
and typescripts&#8212;the diaries, memoirs, notebooks, early drafts and
other fugitive pieces that have been brought out over the past six decades
and that have transformed our sense of her achievement. Collectively,
they demonstrate that Woolf's unpublished&#8212;in some cases at the
time unpublishable&#8212;writings are often as interesting as the work
whose appearance she supervised. And a great many of them, especially the
diary, some of the notebooks, and the various formal experiments in memoir
writing, are integral parts of the unintegrateable autobiography she was
always writing, but that her social and familial training inhibited her
from shaping into final form.

<p>
The unpublished papers are the raw stuff of a posthumous career beyond
her powers of construction which she would at best have had mixed
feelings about preserving. Throughout her life, her avidity for the
fullest disclosure of women's lives matched her personal revulsion
from publicity. She was an intensely private person who made a point
of guarding her anonymity. But it is also essential to understand how
eager she was to collect and store all this material during her lifetime,
whatever her intentions were toward the end. In 1940, a few months before
her death, both the houses the Woolfs had recently occupied in London
were bombed and a great deal of their property destroyed. Not, however,
the most important things, as far as Woolf was concerned. When she and
Leonard drove up from Sussex to survey the damage and rescue what they
could, the most valuable items to be retrieved were "all my papers." In
sifting through the rubble, she knew exactly what she was looking for
and why she needed it: "litter, glass, black soft dust, plaster powder. . . . A wind blowing through. I began to hunt out diaries. What cd
we salvage in this little car?" The immediate answer was "24 vols of
diary salved; a great mass for my memoirs"; eventually all the surviving
manuscripts made their way to their Sussex retreat.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 The connection between the fugitive papers and the "Sketch of the Past"
 she had been working on for over a year licensed what she called "all
 this scribble," whether or not anyone else would ever read the fuller
 record. Her model is alchemy: "I think one day I may brew a tiny ingot
 out of it&#8212;in my memoirs" (<i>DOVW</i>, 5:269, 19 February 1940).

<p>
The literary quality of the fragmented and far from complete final memoir
that did get drafted is so striking that it is tempting to see it as
the alchemist's reward toward which Woolf had worked. In Hermione Lee's
judgment, "the 'Sketch of the Past' has the depth and experience of her
whole writing life behind it, and is able to make a profound, detailed
analysis of how she writes about herself." She calls it "the true history"
of Woolf's childhood and youth that her earlier autobiographical attempts
had not succeeded in conveying, not only because of the inhibitions
inscribed by her training but because she had lacked the maturity to
understand what had happened from

<b></b>

disparate points of view.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 As Lee suggests, the sketch analyzes its own procedures of remembering
 as it records the memories. Even in its disconnected state, it
 is certainly a major work and a striking advance over her earlier
 attempts. Yet to treat Woolf's final endeavor to write her life story
 as a triumphant solution to the problems she faced in recounting it,
 is to play down the experimental quality of that work, its deliberate
 "sketchiness." As we will see, Woolf's memoir project involved a
 variety of bedrock problems that surfaced again and again in all her
 autobiographical writings. Their shape-changing persistence through
 many tries at articulation suggests that she was tackling issues
 intrinsic to the family memoir as a form, brought to prominence by
 her determination to master the autobiographical genre and make it
 serve her determination to revise the record-keeping tradition of the
 (paternal) family to which she belonged.

<p>
The Stephens had written memoirs for generations and had made sure to
preserve the family legacy for posterity. Some were private documents,
others intended for publication. The tradition began long before Woolf
was born and persisted after her death.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 All were based on the authority of personal witness that only a
 participant could claim, but over the course of several generations,
 the role of record keeper stopped being primarily a masculine
 entitlement. Her great-grandfather produced <i>The Memoirs of James
 Stephen</i>, written between 1819 and 1825 for the instruction of his
 children, preserved by his grandchildren, and only published in 1954.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Her father Leslie Stephen was the author both of the official biography
 of his distinguished brother Sir James Fitzjames Stephen  and
 of the private memoir of his wife Julia for the audience of their
 children, who irreverently referred to it as "The Mausoleum Book"
 (written 1895-1903, published 1977).
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 In due course, the young Virginia Stephen was delegated by her
 siblings to select the letters her father's official biographer would
 be permitted to use, and to write the brief personal reminiscence by
 "one of his daughters" included in that volume.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 This was to be her first public (if anonymous) attempt to take
 on the role of family chronicler, usually the province of the male
 inheritors. After her death the family narrative tradition continued,
 even exfoliated. The last volumes of Leonard Woolf's massive
 autobiography were as much about Virginia's life as his own.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Her sister Vanessa Bell produced a memoir called "Notes on Virginia's
 Childhood" as well as others that have not been published.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 Leonard Woolf commissioned Vanessa's son Quentin to write the 1972
 official biography, based on the private papers he had decided despite
 his wife's injunction to preserve; Quentin's wife Anne Olivier Bell
 edited the aforementioned five-volume <i>Diary</i> (1977-84); and
 Vanessa's daughter Angelica Garnett in her turn published a family
 memoir, <i>Deceived with Kindness: A Bloomsbury Childhood</i> ,
 which&#8212;as its title suggests&#8212;was definitely <i>not</i>
 the authorized biography of her parents.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
Through all these generations and permutations anticipating and following
Woolf's intervention, a number of essential questions persist. For whom
was the memoir written: for the memoirist? for the nuclear family? for an
inner circle or coterie? for the wider public interested in the subject's
achievements? for a literary audience with a taste in autobiographical
writing? And for what purpose: to honor the dead? to instruct the
survivors? to make the past cohere? to produce the official record? to
amuse

<b></b>

and entertain? to illustrate a representative way of life? to confess? to
understand oneself? to take control of the family narrative and pay
off old scores? The multi-generational Stephen internal tradition of
memoir writing illustrated all these options and offered a bewildering
set of obligations and opportunities for each new installment of the
saga. Some of the choices were exclusive. It is difficult at best to
write simultaneously for an intimate and a faceless audience. One can
hardly observe the injunction to honor one's father and one's mother
while using the opportunity to voice the grievances of a lifetime. And
the disparities between the public and the private life are sometimes
so shocking as to seem barely believable to an outsider. Above all,
how can the family memoirist even pretend to provide a reliable record
when he or she is inevitably a biased witness?

<p>
In his biography of his aunt, Quentin Bell worries that his "affection"
for her "could easily result in a loss of objectivity," either by turning
her into a saint or&#8212;if he tried to stress his freedom from familial
pressure&#8212;by exaggerating her flaws. It is only by sticking to
"the truth and nothing but the truth" of her character and development
that he might do justice to his task (<i>VWAB</i>, xiv). This dream
of what used to be called the definitive biography has not survived
the multiple skepticisms of the late twentieth century. Virginia Woolf
came to understand the chimerical nature of the goal and was intensely
conscious of how partial (in both primary senses of the word) any account
of one's family history is sure to be. For one thing the perceived
patterns are constantly changing shape as one grows older. In "A Sketch
of the Past," she sees herself at the moment of composition as dominated
by the exigencies of that instant: "What I write today I should not write
in a year's time" (<i>MOB</i>, 75). But this realization only came to her
gradually and was intensified by her awareness of the multi-generational
family record and of the discontinuities of her own contributions to
it. In reading the family archive and in re-encountering the selves that
had produced the earlier narratives, she became aware of the options she
had followed, of others she had rejected, and of the need at least to
be conscious of the choices she was making. In this task, her ancestors
and the girl and younger woman she had been might help her by revealing
what each had included in and excluded from the record. Woolf was fully
aware of the family legacy she would continue&#8212;and transform.

<p>
The first determinant was the choice of audience and of conscious
purpose. Her great-grandfather James Stephen's <i>Memoirs</i> begin with
a clear sense of whom he is addressing and what he intends to convey:
"I write for the sake of my children. I wish to inform them faithfully
of the events of my own life, because I think it may be useful to
them in the conduct of theirs" (<i>TMOJS</i>, 26). He aims to record
"the history of my sins and temptations" rather than his achievements
(of which there were many in his notable public life) in order to record
the slow growth of his conscience and to demonstrate "the superintendence
of a wise and just, tho' most merciful and gracious Providence" in human
affairs (<i>TMOJS</i>, 404). His method is confessional and didactic,
his goal to write a spiritual autobiography focusing on the errors of
his youth for the benefit of the particular young sinners he had brought
into the world. His is a cautionary tale of filial transgression and
its consequences (in both his father's life and his own)

<b></b>

clearly aimed at any such tendencies in his own progeny. The mixture of
self-accusation and coercive moralizing (in which every single recorded
incident in a narrative of over 400 printed pages is interpreted as an
example of the workings of a benevolent providence) has a relentlessly
hortatory quality that could well have illustrated the pitfalls of writing
one's memoirs with a single aim and audience in mind. Quite aside from
the agnosticism Woolf absorbed from both her parents that inoculated her
against writing providential narratives of any kind, the flattening effect
of the single cause, the dangers of rationalizing the contradictions of
a lifetime in one grand explanatory scheme, might have warned her of
the perils of following this familial path. She would gradually learn
to distrust any conscious purpose in autobiographical writing.

<p>
Her father's "Mausoleum Book" was a secular variant of a memoir with
an agenda. Begun immediately after Julia Stephen's untimely death in
1895, it too is strictly a private document, addressed directly and
exclusively to the seven children she had borne. Leslie warns them that
what follows "is absolutely confidential between you and me" and enjoins
them to <i>keep</i> it private "always" (<i>SLSMB</i>, 3). Like his
grandfather James's memoir, it is simultaneously confessional, reverent,
and coercive. He is the sinner who had caused his wife untold pain through
his impatience, irritability, and ceaseless self-deprecating demand
for reassurance; the deity is his late espoused saint (whose beauty
is "absolutely faultless," who represents "all that is holy" in human
affection [<i>SLSMB</i>, 31]); and the targets of his injunctions are the
children, who are repeatedly instructed never to forget: "Ah! my darlings,
try to fix her picture in your minds" (<i>SLSMB</i>, 33). He reminds them
that "grief is of all things not to be wasted" (<i>SLSMB</i>, 71). He
treats it as a precious nutrient that will imprint the memory of Julia
Stephen forever, as though he were the voice of her ghost, reiterating
"Remember me!" No wonder the more rebellious Stephen children likened
Leslie's memoir to a mausoleum, the gigantic, ostentatious structure
erected by the widow of King Mausolos in Halicarnassus that became one of
the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: flesh turned to stone, dominating
the landscape and transforming a particular person into a monument inhuman
in scale and robbed of individuality. Leslie's veneration effaces Julia's
words and gestures and individual acts, discursively riding over mere
incident: "I have been dropping into narrative" (<i>SLSMB</i>, 66)
he apologizes at one point before resuming his litany of praise.

<p>
Virginia Woolf learned about the danger of reverence from her father's
memoir, its tendency to turn flesh and blood into a marmoreal object. What
concerned her was not the proper attitude to the dead but their individual
identity as it might be recovered in the most random memories. In
"Reminiscences," the first of her formal memoirs (<i>MOB</i>, 28-59),
Woolf reflects: "What would one not give to recapture a single phrase
even! or the tone of the clear round voice, or the sight of the beautiful
re, so upright and so distinct, in its long shabby cloak, with the
head held at a certain angle, a little upwards, so that the eye looked
straight out at you. 'Come children,' she would say directly she had
waved her last fantastic farewell, and one would grasp her umbrella,
and another her arm, and one no doubt would stand gaping, and she would
call sharply, 'Quick, quick'." Such precise visual and aural recall,
Woolf hopes, may come

<b></b>

closer to resurrecting the dead than "those sincere but conventional
phrases . . . the noble lamentations" of "The Mausoleum Book," in which
words "drape themselves in smooth folds annulling all evidence of life"
(<i>MOB</i>, 36-37). In her "Reminiscences," the generic sculpted
draperies give way to the identifiable long shabby cloak. The statue
moves, talks, is palpably alive.

<p>
Yet reverence was hard to expunge, especially in memorial writing,
because its absence indirectly challenged the classical injunction
<i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>. When the young Virginia was asked to
contribute a brief personal reminiscence for Frederic Maitland's 1906
official biography of her father, she limited herself to the qualities
she could praise unreservedly&#8212;their shared love of reading, their
passion for literature. He read countless novels aloud to his children
or recited poetry from memory, and she sums up the effect on her: "many
of the great English poems now seem to me inseparable from my father;
I hear in them not only his voice, but in some sort his teaching and
belief." As with her mother, she needed to fix the sound of her father's
voice. No family conflicts can be recorded in such a public document, of
course; so in her account the children are generally referred to as "we"
or "us" or "one of us." And sometimes the plural pronoun includes her
father as well: "there was a perfectly equal companionship between us"
(<i>LLLS</i>, 474). Maitland also celebrates this generational concord
in his own summary of Leslie Stephen's family life after Julia's death:
"All went better every year. His daughters grew up, his sons went to
public schools and then to Cambridge, and the love that he had bestowed
and was bestowing was amply returned" (<i>LLLS</i>, 477). It would take
over three decades for Woolf to challenge this bland, sentimental vision
in a more complex account that separated and distinguished the siblings
from each other and that made room for her rage against her father as
well as for her love.

<p>
Her inhibition was rooted in the common practice of writing <i>for</i>
the family, which came with the territory of the family memoir as a
distinct form of autobiography. Woolf's first sense of audience goes
back as far as the <i>Hyde Park Gate News</i>, produced in collaboration
with her siblings between 1891 and 1895 and suspended forever on her
mother's death. The surviving issues are housed in the British Library
manuscripts division and have still not been published, though they are
as interesting as the juvenilia of the Bront&euml; siblings. The three-
or four-page weekly paper appeared every Monday, like some village organ,
its columns filled with family and neighborhood gossip, miscellaneous
notices, anecdotes, riddles, poems, "love letters," and installments of
longer fictions "to be continued next time." It is not always clear which
sibling was responsible for which entry, and the sense of an anonymous
generational voice is sometimes used strategically. Yet "Miss Virginia
Stephen" seems disproportionately present as author or subject, and rivals
to her authority are swiftly disposed of. When the younger brother Adrian
plans a competitive publication, the impersonal editorial voice opines,
"We hope that Master Adrian Stephen will take the advice of his parent
and give up the 'Talland Gazette' altogether" (<i>HPGN</i>, 27 June 1892).
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 The complicity of daughter and parent suggested here is typical. The
 parents were editorial board, audience and judge in one, and everything
 in the paper was designed to win their approval. Far from being the
 voice of independent youth, the journal exaggerated the Olympian
 language

<b></b>

(and the benevolent condescension) of the grownups. It showed off a
precociously adult vocabulary even at the risk of spelling mishaps:
equestrian, benignant, equanimity; but also "ignaramus," "Roomitism." And
the children regularly refer to themselves as "the aforementioned
juveniles" whose actions demonstrate qualities like "the elasticity of
youth" (<i>HPGN</i>, 8 and 15 February 1892). The aim is to amuse, to
delight. They sit in anticipation of their mother's reception of an April
Fool's letter: "The anxious infants awaited her burst of laughter. And
at last it came 'Ha ha ha he he he' laughed she with all the good-natured
vehemence of her nature" (<i>HPGN</i>, 4 April 1892).

<p>
What hope did a child with such a firm literary vocation have of finding
a voice of her own if she was so desperate to please the res of
authority in her world? It may seem absurd to ask such a question about
a writer who has not even reached adolescence. Yet the <i>Hyde Park Gate
News</i> actually supplies an answer. Mimicry is not replication; it is
mockery. From her earliest years Virginia Stephen used ironic detachment
as a weapon, as Vanessa noted with some bitterness in her own later memoir
of her sister: "How did she know that to label me 'The Saint' was far
more effective [than abuse], quickly reducing me to the misery of sarcasm
from the grown-ups as well as the nursery world?" (<i>ABGR</i>, 332). The
tone of Virginia's house organ mocked everything it described&#8212;the
children's "achievements" (their merit badges from the educational
establishments), their distinguished father's awards (two honorary
doctorates in 1895 are duly recorded), the triumphs and disappointments
of the marriage market, which is seen primarily as a fiercely competitive
economic arena. Their cousin Millicent Vaughan has visited her married
sister in Canada, the paper reports; and editorializes: "We hope that no
pangs of jealousy crowd her mind when she sees her sister so comfortably
settled with a husband when she herself is searching the wide world in
quest of matrimony" (<i>HPGN</i>, 14 March 1892). Such passages recall
the young Austen at her most malicious and anticipate the wide-eyed
bitchiness of Daisy Ashford's <i>The Young Visiters</i>. Marriage is a
major subject of the <i>Hyde Park Gate News</i>, and the heterodox picture
of that institution it presents is not pretty: estranged couples, resented
babies, retreats into spinsterhood, cynical mixtures of calculation and
high romance are everywhere in the journal, described with just enough
of a sense of absurdity to avoid tripping the alarm. A proposal letter
in one of the stories treads a fine line: "I wish you to be my partner
in life my star with which to grope up life's dim road!! I must now turn
to vulgar matters such as Pounds Shillings and Pence I have plenty of
all three and so I hope have you but it does not matter to me what your
dowry may be as long as I have you oh most divine of divine creatures"
(<i>HPGN</i>, 13 June 1893).

<p>
It is the mock-newspaper's anonymous voice that makes such experimental
satire possible. Woolf can protect her identity and retreat behind
a whole anthology of other voices&#8212;those of her siblings, the
reports of "our correspondent," the male narrator of the fictional
serial "A Cockney's Farming Experiences" and its sequel "The Experiences
of a Pater-familias," "Extracts from the Diary of Miss Sarah Morgan,"
recording a life of marginal gentility and embittered spinsterhood in the
depths of the country (<i>HPGN</i>, 22 August&#8212;26 September 1892,
10 October&#8212;19 December 1892, January&#8212;February 1895).
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 And everywhere we hear the pseudo-parental speech of the adults

<b></b>

mock-heroicizing the doings of the juveniles. By patronizing herself
and her siblings, Woolf anticipates and trumps her parents' generational
patronage: "Are you 'amused' by us?" it seems to say; "We find ouselves
absurdly amusing too!" The only casualty in this battle of wits
(calculated, accepted, absorbed) is the authorial "I." In one of the
last issues of the journal (written during the mother's final illness
and published a few weeks before her death) there is a fictional account
of a character named "the Author." She is being encouraged by others
to write poetry but contemptuously dismisses the whole genre: "Poetry
she considered an indelicate exhibition of your innards" (<i>HPGN</i>,
8 April 1895). By suppressing the lyric voice, working through layers
of irony, donning the mask of objective reporting and taking on the
cool authority of the editorial "we," Virginia Stephen was making an
early bid to construct an authoritative family memoir in the newspaper
of record. That the paper ceased publication on the eve of her mother's
death suggests the limits of what it could report.

<p>
The project of writing directly and exclusively for family members did not
end with its demise. Woolf's next important autobiographical project, and
the first to be included in the collection <i>Moments of Being</i>, was
an attempt to assess the impact of that death in a memoir for a clearly
conceived but not yet visible family audience. She began "Reminiscences"
in 1907, when Vanessa was pregnant with her first child. It was in fact
finished only after Julian's birth but maintains the fiction that the
ungendered "you" who is directly addressed is still in the womb. The
firstborn is in any case a generational representative and can serve as a
stand-in for those to come. The addressee is no more than a convenient
fiction, since the most urgently courted audience of the memoir is
the new couple Clive and Vanessa Bell. Virginia Stephen's claim to be
writing her sister's biography for the benefit of the unborn child is a
way of inserting herself into the new marriage and making sure that the
Stephen name and family history (which stand under threat of erasure)
will survive in a version she can author as well as edit. It will be
in prose rather than verse, but it will come several steps closer to
revealing the "innards" the earlier versions of the family history had
tightly concealed.

<p>
Woolf always had an acute sense of her reader's shaping power: "To know
whom to write for is to know how to write," she concludes in a 1924 essay;
"in a very subtle and insidious way" the audience becomes "the instigator
and inspirer of what is written."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 This sense of her reader affects most aspects of
 "Reminiscences"&#8212;its tone, its sense of what has to be explained
 and what can be taken for granted, its tactics of presentation. Yet the
 clearly identifiable audience of Woolf's first formal memoir, though
 minuscule, was difficult to address as a unit. Vanessa was of course
 her intimate ally, the sibling whose sympathetic understanding she
 could almost take for granted; but her new husband was for Virginia a
 virtual unknown, a potential threat, and a powerful rival for Vanessa's
 affection. He needed to be wooed and convinced that he would never
 understand his wife without becoming aware of the sisters' shared
 family history and the unbreakable bond between them; and the unborn
 children had to be indoctrinated in

<b></b>

the lore of the Stephen sect, though they would bear a different
surname. It was a more difficult task than either Woolf's
great-grandfather or her father had faced in writing their memoirs for
the exclusive audience of their own children.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 But like her male predecessors' works, it remained in the family and was
 kept out of the hands of strangers: it seems in fact to have survived
 in only one copy.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 And like the memoirs of the earlier Stephens, it followed (though it
 did not announce) an agenda.

<p>
"Reminiscences" is a tightly structured tale of an unwilled matrilineal
succession, in which the family office of housekeeper and mother must
be occupied by someone no matter at what cost. Julia Stephen died at
forty-nine and left a gaping hole not only in the hearts of those who
mourned her but in the structure of the home she had managed, which
served the needs of an exacting husband, eight children from three
different marriages, a wide circle of relations, friends and professional
associates, and a large staff of servants under her authority. She was
mourned indefinitely; but more pressingly, her death created a vacancy
to be filled, and apparently from within the family. Her eldest daughter
Stella Duckworth was pressed into service at the age of twenty-six,
surrendering much of what remained of her youth and freedom to the
requirements of the job, and having eventually to negotiate terms with
her stepfather Leslie Stephen in order to marry her long-time suitor and
set up a nominally separate establishment virtually next door. Stella's
own appalling death a mere two years after her mother's reopened the
position. And the next recruit was her half-sister Vanessa, only eighteen
at the time, but required to assume these domestic responsibilities,
a post she took up with much greater resentment and dismay. But she
appeared to have no choice: "She fulfilled the duties which Stella had
but lately fulfilled," Woolf writes; and people "acclaimed her now the
divinely appointed inheritor of all womanly virtues" (<i>MOB</i>, 53,
55). The Housekeeper is dead! Long live the Housekeeper! "Reminiscences"
is shaped by Woolf's grim conclusion that "our lives are pieces in a
pattern and to judge one truly you must consider how this one is squeezed
and that indented and a third expanded and none are really isolated"
(<i>MOB</i>, 30). In such a family system we are all structurally defined,
and the idea of individual liberty, choice, or even character is barely
more than notional.

<p>
Woolf is relentless in patterning the memoir to illustrate this thesis:
Julia replaced by Stella replaced by Vanessa is the narrative's plot,
and at the climactic moment the father is seen as a kind of Bluebeard,
in words that no appropriately reverent family memoir would have dared to
use: "he was quite prepared to take Vanessa for his next victim," Woolf
writes; "it was not strange that an uncompromising anger took possession
of her. We made him the type of all that we hated in our lives; he was
the tyrant of inconceivable selfishness, who had replaced the beauty
and merriment of the dead with ugliness and gloom." These are startling
words from someone who had written just a few years earlier, for her
father's biographer, that "there was a perfectly equal companionship
between us." Yet the later image is not much less of a distortion than
the earlier one, and Woolf's summarizing judgment clearly does not
satisfy her. It moves too seamlessly from Vanessa's feelings to her own,
and&#8212;in order to please her immediate audience&#8212;plays down
her own ambiguous response by translating her sister's

<b></b>

fury into "our" hatred. "We made him the type" suggests both distortion
and opportunism, and Woolf is quick to modify her critique: "We were
bitter, harsh, and to a great extent, unjust; but even now it seems to
me that there was some truth in our complaint" (<i>MOB</i>, 56). Other
parts of the memoir focus not on the sisters' outrage but on Woolf's
sense of the beauty of her parents' relationship: "it was a triumphant
life, consistently aiming at high things" (<i>MOB</i>, 34).

<p>
These responses are scarcely consistent, and despite its agenda
"Reminiscences" is an unstable work. But it does firmly shift the ground
of the family memoir from male achievement to women's labor&#8212;not
their beauty or their virtues or their talents but what they actually
manage to get done. In sharp contrast to <i>The Memoirs of James
Stephen</i> or Leslie's biography of his brother Fitzjames or Maitland's
account of Leslie, "Reminiscences" virtually eradicates the male career
narrative. The record of Sir Leslie Stephen's achievements and honors,
the story of the four sons in the family and where they are headed is here
conspicuous by its absence. So, interestingly enough, is any description
of the differing vocational ambitions of the women&#8212;each of whom
would create some tension between her work outside the home and her
"inherited" family role: Julia's professional interest in nursing,
Vanessa's determination to paint, Virginia's to write. (That Stella
Duckworth apparently had no such calling is treated as an anomaly, a
lack.) The whole career trajectory, which if successful produces a public
record, finds no place in "Reminiscences." Woolf is much more interested
in recording the unceasing labor, as unwavering and continuous as the
ticking of a clock, that keeps the family going, day after day, year
after year, until the machine breaks down and must be replaced. This
is the nature of "women's work," and Woolf would make it one of her
essential subjects.

<p>
In order to undermine such assumptions of Victorian family life, she
needed and eventually found allies; those she associated herself with
crucially influenced her way of writing memoirs. The rebellion against
nineteenth-century domestic ideology is of course a familiar subject, and
many of the writers of Woolf's generation participated in it, including
the Bloomsbury Group to which she is regularly linked. Their various
experiments in finding alternatives, which included a critique of marital
fidelity, of heterosexuality as an ideal or exclusive choice, of women's
primarily domestic roles and their economic dependence on men, are part
of a much larger cultural shift that has often been described. Much less
well known is the conscious way in which the Group in general and Woolf
in particular used autobiographical writing as an instrument and record
of this transformation. Their sense of a gulf between their own lives
and that of their parents was carefully nurtured by a group memorial
effort. The vehicle for the creation of this communal identity was the
Memoir Club, founded in 1920, eventually including all the members of the
Group&#8212;the Woolfs, the Bells, E. M. Forster, John Maynard Keynes,
Roger Fry, Desmond and Molly MacCarthy, Duncan Grant, Lytton Strachey
and others. They met several times a year for a dinner followed by the
reading of formal memoirs written not for publication but for each other.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Two striking facts distinguish this memorial body from others like it:
 that at its founding the average age of the members was around forty
 (Virginia Woolf was thirty-eight), which

<b></b>

seems early to embark on the work of retrospection; and that it continued
to meet for four decades. In 1931, the Club held its hundredth meeting,
which would have meant that by then some two hundred memoirs had been
written and read.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 Memory seemed a bottomless well, and of course as one aged it only
 got deeper.

<p>
It was an association of intimate friends; the meetings were social as
well as intellectual occasions; the memoirs were as often hilarious
as revelatory. But it is inaccurate to dismiss the Club as a mutual
admiration society or as a form of light entertainment. Its members had
from the start set themselves a group task: to produce a record of each
individual life (and of their common lives) that told the truth without
fear of offense or reprisal. Veneration was distrusted. <i>De mortuis
nil nisi bonum</i> was certainly not a governing principle. Shame
and reticence were seen as impediments rather than treated as
inevitable. The critical sympathy of the group acted as a solvent for
residual inhibitions. Here was the ideal audience to respond to an
honest autobiography, and producing such a work in incremental stages
was initially taken to be the goal for each member. Rather than lying
or suppressing the facts or talking to yourself without hope of an
empathetic response, you might write for a group that had shared your
fate&#8212;co-conspirators, fellow "survivors," the family you had chosen
rather than the one you had entered by biological accident. The inhibiting
effect of writing for a familial audience could be dissipated by
addressing kindred spirits rather than kin. That at least was the theory.

<p>
Three of the memoirs Woolf wrote for this group are included in
Schulkind's <i>Moments of Being</i>&#8212;"22 Hyde Park Gate,"
"Old Bloomsbury," and "Am I a Snob?" (<i>MOB,</i> 164-77, 181-201,
204-20). Written between 1920 and 1936 they might be taken to form a
linked sequence with the very early "Reminiscences" (1907-08) and the
late "Sketch of the Past" (1939-40). If one adds to this the continuity
(and sometimes the overlap) of subject matter between the three surviving
Club contributions and the longer memoirs at either end of her career,
it is tempting to treat the whole posthumous collection as a coherent
autobiography with a plan of its own, and Schulkind argues for such a
reading: "the fragments do arrange themselves into a meaningful order;
a pattern emerges which expresses Virginia Woolf's view of the self
generally, and herself in particular, in ways that a conventional
autobiography could not have done."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 When treated in this way, the large gaps can be taken to illustrate
 Woolf's doubts about the stability of individual identity and her sharp
 sense that our memory perpetually revises the past. It is an ingenious
 argument, but it makes the fortuitous seem like a deliberate plan and
 it minimizes the effect of addressing the very different audiences
 for which these pieces were actually written. As we will see, Woolf's
 contributions to the Group's collective autobiography have a distinct
 identity.

<p>
Her writings for the Memoir Club grasped the opportunity for effortless
understanding that audience offered. But the Club was both enabling
and disabling for Woolf's autobiographical venture, and her three
surviving essays are more closely related to each other in ambition,
tone, and effect than to the longer pieces that preceded or followed
them. The atmosphere was decidedly liberating. No subject seemed off
limits: family piety could be mocked; "sex permeated our conversation"
(<i>MOB</i>, 195-96); even a brother's incestuous desire could be
described. The Club's members were sophisticated

<b></b>

and well-educated; they could recognize allusions and follow an argument
without requiring tedious explanations. An observant, quick-witted, deeply
read person like Virginia Woolf loved the intellectually rapid narratives
and the lively discussion that followed. To be carefully attended to;
to be able to take a great deal for granted; not to go step by step: the
Club seemed like the ideal audience. And Woolf's diary entries about these
meetings often express her interest and delight in what she heard: Maynard
Keynes "very packed profound &amp; impressive"; Duncan Grant "fantastic
&amp; tongue&#8212;not tied&#8212;tongue enchanted"; Leonard Woolf
"objective &amp; triumphant" (<i>DOVW</i>, 5:168, 12 September 1938; 2:23,
6 March 1920; 2:26, 18 March 1920). The last of these entries, however,
continues: "I subjective &amp; most unpleasantly discomfited." There was
such a thing as a "Memoir Club memoir," and Woolf quickly learned its
(unwritten) rule: be objective, even clinical, rather than exposing
your "innards." Deep personal engagement was likely to be heard as
sentimentality, even mawkishness, and suggested that one was still a
prisoner of the past. The once threatening is now better seen as absurd
and best treated as farce. What she calls the "uncomfortable boredom on
the part of the males" that greeted one of her earliest contributions
made her squirm: "What possessed me to lay bare my soul!" she asks herself
(<i>DOVW</i>, 2:26, 18 March 1920). Of Forster's and Strachey's ventures
she concludes "they say what they mean, very brilliantly; &amp; leave
the dark as it was before" (<i>DOVW</i>, 2:178, 23 June 1922). Despite
the powerful imaginative and organizational contributions of the three
women in the group, despite the absence of the paterfamilias and of the
band of brothers, a male camaraderie set the tone.

<p>
Woolf learned to play the Club's game by these rules. Her memoirs for
this audience are often shimmering and designed to tease, to shock, to
entertain, to criticize the licensed satiric targets and to celebrate
the enlightened work of the liberators. They re-describe the oppressive
patriarchal atmosphere of the Stephen family dungeon at 22 Hyde Park
Gate less as the prison house of women than as the lunatic asylum of
men. The sexual threat of her half-brother George Duckworth is exposed,
but in a mocking tone that covers over the details and consciously plays
with the ambiguities of the word "lover." The memoir concludes: "Yes, the
old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia never knew that George Duckworth
was not only father and mother, brother and sister to those poor Stephen
girls; he was their lover also" (<i>MOB</i>, 177). Keynes was to call this
memoir&#8212;much to Woolf's annoyance&#8212;"the best thing you ever did"
(<i>DOVW</i>, 2:121, 26 May 1921). She also recorded the history of "Old
Bloomsbury" and its break with the past, as the Cambridge-educated young
men encouraged their sisters and lovers to share the atmosphere of candor
and help dispel the post-Victorian gloom. Here too, Woolf's narrative
unit is the amusing anecdote, as in Lytton Strachey's pretend-casual
question to the just-married Vanessa Bell about the stain on her dress:
"'Semen?' he said. Can one really say it? I thought and we burst out
laughing" (<i>MOB</i>, 195). This has the tone of an oft-told tale in a
complacent group narrative of liberation. Her final "we" is collective,
not individual, designed to illustrate that "the old sentimental views
of marriage in which we were brought up were revolutionized," in part
through "our" agency; and Woolf concludes that "Old

<b></b>

Bloomsbury still survives. If you seek a proof&#8212;look around"
(<i>MOB</i>, 196, 201). The gaze is turned away from the past, away from
the individual memoirist, to the now middle-aged audience beaming its
recognition of their shared youth.

<p>
A great deal must be ignored or expunged to produce such contained,
polished party pieces. The darker, more idiosyncratic private life is
off limits. Although Woolf's Memoir Club narratives take us through the
years of all the appalling Stephen deaths&#8212;mother, sister, father,
and the adored older brother Thoby&#8212;they are barely mentioned. Nor
does she touch on her own breakdown and attempted suicide after her
father's death which had left the Stephen siblings "free." The sexual
revolution described here remains one of word rather than deed, and
Woolf's long private history of sexual fear, confusion, exploration, and
fruitful experiment continues to be taboo, for all the enlightenment on
the subject the Club might legitimately claim. As in the <i>Hyde Park
Gate News</i> and "Reminiscences," the individual, unrepresentative
authorial "I" remains invisible or there only to be mocked, as in her
final surviving contribution, "Am I a Snob?" The very question announces
that she will focus on surfaces&#8212;reputations, titles, wealth. But
she begins with a protest about what these entertaining pieces fail
to explore: "the time has come when we . . . must turn that beam ['the
lamp of memory'] inwards and describe ourselves." She calls the private
self "this universe&#8212;which still to me seems as trackless and
tiger-haunted as . . . Guatemala" (<i>MOB</i>, 204-5), an image which
echoes her diary complaint years earlier that the male contributions to
these meetings, though brilliant, "leave the dark as it was before."

<p>
Although Woolf's desire to change the rules was real and her need urgent
there was something in the very nature of these occasions that made
the exploratory task impossible. All those expectant faces asking to
be entertained are increasingly like those at a family reunion; and the
family, even the family of choice, is impatient with threats to its unity
and harmony. Woolf was not the only member of the Club to question this
dispensation. But when the internal critiques of the Group's complacency
finally come, as in Keynes's searching memoir "My Early Beliefs," written
on the eve of Munich, they take the form not of private exploration but
of impersonal judgment. Despite the "my" of his title, Keynes writes with
a commanding authority in the first person plural about the optimistic
delusions of their youth, stressing the Group's unconscious arrogance:
"We claimed the right to judge every individual case on its merits,
and the wisdom, experience, and self-control to do so successfully";
"We lacked reverence . . . for everything and everyone"; "we completely
misunderstood human nature, including our own."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 For all the devastating force of Keynes's critique, he keeps resolutely
 to the plural pronoun, as if to suggest that although "we" were once
 deluded, "we" can now see how unrealistic our inter-war optimism
 was. The strength of group vision is unchallenged, though subject
 to massive revision; and the judgmental confidence of the memoirist
 remains unshaken.

<p>
There is no room for the more tentative, introspective, experimental "I"
in such a critique, and Woolf's commitment to exploring that uncharted
territory would have to

<b></b>

find another audience. The inability to imagine the particular human
being whose actions are recorded in life narratives became for her the
chief failing of the biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs she
read so avidly; and she did not exempt her own earlier efforts. She
grew more and more impatient with the erasure of individual or
idiosyncratic consciousness in autobiographical writing. This is why
she had to reconstruct her very first memories in writing "A Sketch of
the Past," rather than building on what she had previously written. Her
dissatisfaction with her own methods and that of most memoir writers
focuses on the missing subject: "They leave out the person to whom things
happened. . . . So they say: 'This is what happened'; but they do not
say what the person was like to whom it happened." And so she begins
again: "Who was I then?" (<i>MOB</i>, 65). In using the first person
singular she deliberately rejects her earlier practice of effacing
her own identity and merging it with those of her Stephen siblings:
"This leads me to think that my&#8212;I would say 'our' if I knew enough
about Vanessa, Thoby and Adrian&#8212;but how little we know even about
brothers and sisters&#8212;this leads me to think that my natural love
for beauty was checked by some ancestral dread" (<i>MOB</i>, 68). This
remarkable, doubly-interrupted sentence might stand for the consistent
effort Woolf makes in writing "A Sketch of the Past" to question the
shortcuts and unconscious claims of her earlier autobiographical pieces
and to interrogate her own methods of writing memoirs. An unremitting
self-consciousness is put to work. She contests the complacencies of
the genre almost word by word, constantly interrupting and questioning
her strategies as she uses them. She needs to test every inch of the
marshy ground in order to locate something resembling terra firma. And
she isolates her own memory and experience as it might differ from those
of others, even those living in the same household.

<p>
Despite the pervasive rhetoric of liberation, individual erotic experience
had remained one of the taboo subjects in Bloomsbury memoirs. In fact,
the group imperative of celebrating the new freedom creates its own form
of censorship. When she decides, this time around, to record her first
sexual encounter, she does not turn it into the teasing show-stopper that
ended "22 Hyde Park Gate," with George Duckworth's ambiguous embrace. As
she describes her other half-brother Gerald Duckworth (twelve years her
senior) propping her childish body on a ledge outside the dining room, she
vividly recalls the touch of his fingers working their way down her flesh:
"I can remember the feel of his hand going under my clothes; going firmly
and steadily lower and lower. I remember how I hoped that he would stop;
how I stiffened and wriggled as his hand approached my private parts. But
it did not stop. His hand explored my private parts too. I remember
resenting, disliking it&#8212;what is the word for so dumb and mixed a
feeling? It must have been strong, since I still recall it." Woolf is
trying to explain why she had always felt "ashamed or afraid of my own
body" (<i>MOB</i>, 68-69). As she describes this incident in detail she
avoids the temptation to interpret it. Did it "cause" her sense of fear
and shame, her resistance to heterosexuality? She doesn't know, and she
is even reluctant to identify her response: resent? dislike? Neither
word seems adequate. More important than choosing the word or linking
the experience to adult choices is the need to recall the exact shape
of what happened then, the particular

<b></b>

incident and her own body's response. It had occurred half a century
earlier, but it must be brought vividly to life as though it were
happening now. Woolf records her uncertainty about what she describes:
"I do not suppose that I have got at the truth; yet this is a simple
incident; and it happened to me personally; and I have no motive for lying
about it." And yet, despite her dissatisfaction with what she has learned
in recalling and recounting the story, she insists that life histories,
whether memoirs or biographies, that ignore such intensely private
moments&#8212;there were no witnesses and neither participant would
have wanted to publicize the incident&#8212;can hardly be trusted. She
protests that "in spite of all this, people write what they call 'lives'
of other people; that is, they collect a number of events, and leave
the person to whom it happened unknown" (<i>MOB</i>, 69).

<p>
As Woolf's complaint suggests, she was identifying a problem that affected
both memoir writing and biography&#8212;not so much lack of information as
reluctance to use what one knows. That she was writing "A Sketch of the
Past" simultaneously with, and as a kind of antidote to, her biography
<i>Roger Fry</i>  made her hyper-aware of the parallels.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 She had known Fry intimately: he had been a central re in
 Bloomsbury. Woolf thought he may at one point have saved Vanessa's life,
 and he certainly became her sister's lover. His papers, including their
 love letters, were at her disposal and she was surrounded by public and
 private sources of information&#8212;witnesses, participants, eager to
 help her record Fry's remarkable life. The Bloomsbury code of frankness
 presumably freed her to tell the truth, rather than encouraging her to
 produce the official biography of a venerable re. But Woolf quickly
 learned that this freedom was illusory. The Fry family objected to
 the inclusion of any account of the adulterous liaison, and Woolf soon
 found herself the victim, as Hermione Lee puts it, of "the Victorian
 censorship which had been one of her life-long subjects . . . and the
 book was full of what 'must be left unsaid'" (<i>VW</i>, 697). That
 "must" was Woolf's word, but it was learned not only from Fry's kinfolk
 but from her Memoir Club associates. By 1939 she felt she was living
 in a newly repressive atmosphere, a kind of post-post-Victoriansm,
 "surrounded by a circle of invisible censors" (<i>DOVW</i>, 5: 229, 7
 August 1939). Keynes dismisses her Fry biography as "the official life"
 and tauntingly asks her, "why not write the real life for the Memoir
 Club?" (<i>DOVW</i>, 5:314, 2 September 1940). But we have already
 seen precisely how much freedom that audience encouraged. And when it
 came to describing sexual difficulties, rather than celebrating the
 new freedom, the license to speak frankly was revoked. This becomes
 clear in a diary record of an earlier conversation with Keynes: "About
 Roger. 'Can I mention erection?' I asked. . . . No you cant. I should
 mind your saying it. Such revelations have to be in key with their
 time. The time not come yet" (<i>DOVW</i>, 5:256, 6 January 1940).

<p>
Whether one wrote for the public audience or the intimate
circle of friends, then, the message was the same: real candor was
impossible&#8212;not here, not now. Woolf's intense frustration in writing
<i>Roger Fry</i>, a book that was turning marmoreal under her touch
when she had meant it to record her friend's unquenchable vitality and
labile responsiveness, made her work on it feel like alienated labor. She
later called it "an experiment in self-suppression" (<i>LOVW</i>, 6:456,
31 December 1940), by which she

<b></b>

meant that the twin pressures of including the mass of primary
documents and of excluding what might give offense ended by silencing
her voice. Having agreed to write it, she was bound to finish. But she
desperately needed a retreat, a text of her own. This is how "A Sketch of
the Past" came to take the shape it did&#8212;open, hurried, interrupted,
exploratory, unfixed. It was simultaneously an autobiographical record
and a critique of the conventions of life writing. If she could not
speak the truth about Roger Fry's life because both the kinfolk and the
kindred spirits disapproved, perhaps she might at last be able to produce
an honest memoir for a non-censorious audience of one&#8212;herself. The
manuscript of "A Sketch of the Past" was produced fitfully in stolen days,
with many interruptions, as an escape from what she thought of as "Fry
facts." It did not record many facts, but it struggled to recuperate the
impressions of her early childhood in sensuous detail. It was not so much
a narrative as a re-enactment, as though she had found a way of reentering
the past by sending her body back to it. At the same time, Woolf tried
to keep her consciousness here, so that the two selves&#8212;what she
calls "I now, I then" (<i>MOB</i>, 75)&#8212;would be able to carry on a
continuous conversation across the decades. The audience was herself, or
her <i>selves</i>, not another who needed to be mollified or entertained.

<p>
The task requires a great deal of methodological self-awareness, and
Woolf perpetually monitors what she is doing as she is doing it, becoming
a more detached participant in the proceedings. Her goal is to produce,
sequentially if not simultaneously, as direct a record of the past as
she can retrieve, an interpretation of what had happened as seen from
her present-day vantage point, and a meta-account of her working methods
as a memoir writer.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 This was a tall order, virtually certain to produce discontinuities,
 but perhaps more interesting as a project than writing the full-dress
 memoir for which these were to be only the rough notes. There are many
 indications that she was deliberately cramming the page with a jumble
 of impressions, recording the kaleidoscopic shift of images that came to
 her when she tried to call up a scene. She lived among painters, and she
 did not use the word "sketch" idly. These were preliminary notations
 for a later, more discriminating eye to develop or discard. She
 hoped that the conscious artist she had always been would one day
 be able to use all this raw material to shape something much more
 final. In the meantime, as she puts it, "I will write down some of my
 distracted and disconnected thoughts; to serve, should the time come,
 for notes"(<i>MOB</i>, 95). The "Sketch" was intended to be no more
 than an <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i>, and sometimes she despairs of ever
 being able to use it for that purpose. But that is her plan. After a
 long interruption during which she did no work on the project at all,
 she asks herself, "shall I ever finish these notes&#8212;let alone
 make a book from them?" (<i>MOB</i>, 100).

<p>
The answer, as anyone reading those words is aware, is no. But in a
curious twist, the incompleteness becomes a strength. The extraordinary
vitality and adventurousness of Woolf's "Sketch of the Past" is the
product of her eagerness to record the contradictions and unresolved
mysteries of what she remembered before they evaporated. She instinctively
realized that instability was an essential element in the past she
wanted to recapture. The lack of pattern was in fact the pattern:
"Many bright colours; many

<b></b>

distinct sounds; some human beings, caricatures; comic; several violent
moments of being, always including a circle of the scene which they cut
out: and all surrounded by a vast space&#8212;that is a rough visual
description of childhood. . . . But somehow into that picture must
be brought, too, the sense of movement and change. Nothing remained
stable long" (<i>MOB</i><b>, </b>79). In order to convey this chronic
instability&#8212;the constant stream of friends and relations, the moves
back and forth between London and St. Ives, the transformative impact
of Julia Stephen's death, of those serial deaths, the rapid growth of
eight children under one roof each assuming a different shape&#8212;the
narrative record must highlight process over product. There were
always too many memories to sift through, no matter how long Woolf was
given; and no revision should have expunged this sense of the rushing
stream. When for example she describes St. Ives, the place itself more
than what happened there, she produces a kind of memory flooding&#8212;"an
incongruous, miscellaneous catalogue, little corks that mark a sunken
net" (<i>MOB</i>, 135). The legitimized incoherence and inclusiveness
of Woolf's method becomes a way out of the impasse of memoir writing,
giving to a relatively minor genre the bourgeoning, uncensored vitality
that more finished works of art had lost.

<p>
The freedom she felt to start anywhere, to include anything, merely
monitoring the various methods she found herself using rather than
selecting one from the beginning, worked to free her from the censor
within. "A Sketch of the Past" survives in more than one draft, and
her revision of the first allowed her to deal with subjects she was
initially reluctant to touch. The discovery of the later version (now in
the British Library, but published in the significantly revised second
edition of <i>Moments of Being</i> in 1985) adds over twenty pages to the
original printed text. In that section, Woolf allows herself to describe
her father in terms that no Stephen family memoir of any generation would
have permitted. She goes back to his raw grief after Julia's death and her
own impotent anger at his tyrannous behavior, particularly in the weekly
scenes in which he called the young Vanessa to account for not running
the household as economically and efficiently as her mother had done. She
describes his temper tantrums, his abuse of her sister, Vanessa's stoical
response, and then voices her own suppressed fury by finally breaking
the silence: "Never have I felt such rage and such frustration. For not
a word of what I felt&#8212;that unbounded contempt for him and of pity
for Nessa&#8212;could be expressed. . . . If instead of words he had used
a whip, the brutality could have been no greater"(<i>MOB</i>, 144-45).

<p>
Writing such a description must have been cathartic, and she does not
take back her words by calling them "bitter, harsh, unjust," as she
had in "Reminiscences." But they were not final either. As she works on
"A Sketch of the Past," she discovers a new formal possibility&#8212;to
stand upon the "platform" of the present while viewing the past and "make
the two people, I now, I then, come out in contrast" (<i>MOB</i>, 75). In
practice this means giving equal weight to the recovered feelings of her
original experience and to the more detached understanding she had managed
to develop. A certain analytic distance had in fact always been a strong
element in Woolf's nature, and some form of irony had characterized her
writing as early as the <i>Hyde Park Gate News</i>. It might, however, be
fostered, just as the attempt to recall the past in sensuously immediate

<b></b>

detail could be trained. And so the later version of her memoir includes
passages about her father and the whole system of socialization that
had shaped him&#8212;the Victorian cult of male "genius" that licensed
his eccentric behavior, the ritualization of grief, the power of the
purse in the hands of the paterfamilias, the workings of what she
calls "the great patriarchal machine" (<i>MOB</i>, 153) that molded
all her male relations and stamped them into pre-existing shapes, and
finally the huge gap between her father's generation and her own: "Two
different ages confronted each other in the drawing room at Hyde Park
Gate. The Victorian Age and the Edwardian Age. We were not his children;
we were his grandchildren" (<i>MOB</i>, 147; Leslie was fifty in the
year of Virginia's birth). And then there are the insights afforded
by her own adult reading, with which she takes the full measure of her
father's intellectual gifts and limitations or learns from Freud's work a
term&#8212;ambivalence&#8212;that helps her to understand her simultaneous
love for and hatred of him, a response more complex than her sister's
(<i>MOB</i>, 115, 108).

<p>
All these historical or sociological or psychological insights came
later in time, and they are not permitted to displace the "I then"
of the memoir&#8212;the immediate, sensuous recall of her individual
experience as though it were still in the process of happening. The
abuses can now be explained but must not be explained <i>away</i>. She
reminds herself in a diary entry that "if I read as a contemporary I
shall lose my childs vision &amp; so must stop" (<i>DOVW</i>, 5:345,
22 December 1940). But even during that childhood, Woolf insists,
she was dimly aware of a separate being within herself who might one
day understand what baffled her at the time: "There was a spectator
in me who, even while I squirmed and obeyed, remained observant,
note taking for some future revision" (<i>MOB</i>, 154). Some of the
notes were literally that; she had started keeping a formal journal
as an adolescent, and she had always known it would be useful to her
some day. Others were no more than inchoate impressions, imprinted on
her psyche but originally incomprehensible. This "separate being" of
childhood&#8212;detached, ironic, instinctively critical though initially
at a loss for words&#8212;gradually gains verbal power and authority,
yet must never be allowed simply to take over the record. All of these
voices&#8212;of memory, dimly understood perception, contemporaneous
records, and later analytic theorizing&#8212;might be juxtaposed in the
text if only the memoir as a container were elastic enough to accommodate
them. The problem was formal. This is why Woolf's attention in "A Sketch
of the Past" is so often self-consciously directed toward the narrative
and analytic methods she is actually using as she writes.

<p>
"A Sketch of the Past" is among other things a primer on how to write
a family memoir, including a set of terms that identify the component
parts. There is the "platform of time" (<i>DOVW</i>, 5:281, 25 April
1940) that offers the Olympian perspective of the present. There are the
"moments of being" that Schulkind chooses as the title for her collection,
though Woolf herself does not give the term such primacy. These moments
are a more secular version of what Joyce called "epiphanies," but the
focus is more consistently on the experiencing subject, not on the
object perceived.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 They can give to a private, seemingly random and ordinary incident in
 anyone's life the shock of permanent significance, even though it is
 not obvious to others that anything of consequence

<b></b>

is happening. For example, Woolf recalls that she and Thoby were having
a fistt, that she was winning it, when suddenly she stopped herself
with the question "why hurt another person?"&#8212;just long enough
to give her brother the edge and let him win. She never forgets her
response to this seemingly trivial moment: "It was a feeling of hopeless
sadness. It was as if I became aware of something terrible; and of
my own powerlessness. I slunk off alone, feeling horribly depressed"
(<i>MOB</i>, 71). One could say (though Woolf does not) that this was a
psychological milestone, in which the gender training of A. V. Stephen
suddenly took hold of this "tomboy" and stayed his hand, turning him
into a girl. But the interpretation matters less than the privacy of
the incident. Probably no one else knew that something decisive had
just happened; such "moments of being"&#8212;unlike the triumphs and
disasters of the public record&#8212;often leave no readable sign. Only
the individual memoirist has access to them.

<p>
The theory of "moments of being" is related to what Woolf calls her
habit of "scene-making," her "natural way of marking the past. A
scene always comes to the top; arranged, representative" (<i>MOB</i>,
142). In writing narrative, she thinks not discursively but in images
and incidents; and she has learned from experience that such kernels
will contain and eventually reveal their own meaning without the help
of an impatient decoder. Far from apologizing, as her father had done,
for "dropping into narrative," she nurtures the impulse to record
particulars. Surfaces are not despised but cherished. She packs her
descriptions with dense synaesthetic detail and trusts the reader
(if there ever <i>is</i> a reader) to unpack them, as in this crammed
single-sentence impression of St. Ives: "It was a windy, noisy, fishy,
vociferous, narrow-streeted town; the colour of a mussel or a limpet;
like a bunch of rough shell fish clustered on a grey wall together"
(<i>MOB</i>, 128). Her goal is less to interpret the past than to see,
hear, touch, smell, and feel it. She imagines an invention that would
some day allow us to reenter the experiences stored within us, permitting
us to become time travelers in our own history: "it is only a question
of discovering how we can get ourselves again attached to it, so that
we shall be able to live our lives through from the start" (<i>MOB</i>,
67). Of course she had been reading Proust; but she was also perfecting
her own devices.

<p>
Not all her methods were so close to mystical. Woolf was a learned and
disciplined thinker, despite her complaints about her lack of formal
academic training, and her memoirs were as much the product of her wide
reading and conscious reflection as of imaginative recall. And so she
isolates another essential component of life-writing, the sense of the
"invisible presences" that shape our responses: "Consider what immense
forces society brings to play upon each of us, how that society changes
from decade to decade; and also from class to class; well, if we cannot
analyse these invisible presences, we know very little of the subject
of the memoir; and again how futile life-writing becomes" (<i>MOB</i>,
80). Such external pressures may be impalpable but powerfully shape each
of us, no matter how resistant or rebellious we are. In "A Sketch of the
Past," she analyzes several of these impersonal forces&#8212;ideological,
institutional, historical&#8212;with a keen understanding of how they
shaped her and those around her: the Victorian courtship rituals that
made the relations between the sexes as formal as "relations between
countries are now&#8212;with ambassadors and treaties"; the tea table as

<b></b>

"the centre of Victorian family life"; the career-crunching machinery
of the professional class that processed every male in her circle from
the age of ten and made sure he "emerged at sixty a Head Master, an
Admiral, a Cabinet Minister, or the Warden of a college" (<i>MOB</i>,
99, 118, 153). Each of these examples suggests how much interpretive
distance Woolf had put between her girlhood and her mature identity. And
she thought that the modern habit of analyzing unconscious motives had
clarified much that the Victorians were incapable of understanding about
themselves. Yet a girl or a boy being shaped around 1940 rather than
1890 was just as subject to a new set of "invisible presences" as her own
generation had been. This is how her account of the past differs from the
liberationist rhetoric of her fellow post-Victorians in the Memoir Club
and elsewhere. She needs to view individual lives simultaneously from
the moment when the "invisible presences" have at last become visible,
and from inside the dark capsule of the past, in part because she is not
convinced that the modernist enlightenment is real, or will last. She is,
after all, writing as a new worldwide catastrophe begins.

<p>
There is evidence that she was planning to deal with various significant
subjects untouched in the final surviving draft, and that "A Sketch of
the Past" is not merely unfinished but only partially developed. Aside
from the two long versions, the Woolf archive at the University of
Sussex includes significant deletions, notes to herself, and partially
drafted passages that reveal important pieces of the puzzle not included
in the published text. We are right to think that Woolf's final memoir
is less inhibited and self-censoring than her earlier experiments in
life-writing. But there were several subjects she clearly wanted to deal
with that she could not yet manage to include even here: for example,
her mental breakdowns; her sense that the idolized Thoby was in league
with the repressive males in the family; the causes of her mother's
death. Her first mental illness is described in clinical detail in
one of the drafts but not included in the last surviving version. Her
mother's death, coming in the "amorphous time" of her adolescence,
"brought on, naturally, my first 'breakdown'. It was found that I had a
pulse that raced. It beat so quick I could hardly bear it. No lessons,
no excitement: open air, simple life. So I lived the two years between
my mother's death and Stella's in a state of physical distress." In fact
the whole rich and complex subject of her illnesses does not appear in
her memoirs, though nothing would have more perfectly illustrated the
connections between "the body and the mind" that interested her so much.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 And although there is a long section about Thoby in <i>Moments of
 Being</i> (<i>MOB</i>, 136-40), it is essentially uncritical and
 valedictory in tone. But some of the Sussex manuscripts suggest
 a more complex response to be developed: "His authority. His
 natural rule . . . . Father's pride in him. Kings of men. . . . His
 manliness. . . . Relation to father. To George. Men dont mind these
 things (of G. staying or going)."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 These hints reveal a critical perspective on this male inheritor or
 budding patriarch that is not developed in "A Sketch of the Past." It is
 in effect self-censored. So is an accusatory section about the causes of
 her mother's death. In this manuscript passage, Woolf recounts Stella's
 "doglike devotion to my mother: her perpetual worry about her health
 . . . It was not foolish; for during those years, the strain must have
 been very great; and the illness

<b></b>

from which she died, came no doubt from the incessant activity&#8212;the
perpetual hurry [?reading uncertain], looking after, doing too
much. Stella must have feared what was the truth&#8212;my mother was
worn out, I daresay unnecessarily&#8212;so that when she fell ill,
her heart failed."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 No account of Julia's final illness so squarely linking it to her
 exhausting domestic labor appears in the published draft. Though one
 can only speculate on why this might be so, the reflex reticence of the
 Stephen family memoir may have survived, even in Woolf's revisionist
 account.

<p>
The truth is that we do not know exactly what in these notes and
drafts would have been developed or cut in the final version Woolf
envisioned. Nor are there any indications of a teleology, of where
the manuscript was headed and how it might end. It is all in flux, and
Woolf's last diary entries on the subject make it clear how dissatisfied
she was with the version that survives and yet how confident she seemed
that she could make of it, finally, a work to stand with the others she
had completed. "Then dipped into my memoirs," reads one of them; "too
circuitous &amp; unrelated: too many splutters: as it stands. A real
life has no crisis: hence nothing to tighten. It must lack centre. It
must amble on. All the same, I can weave a very thick pattern, one of
these days, out of that pattern of detail"(<i>DOVW</i>, 5:335, 1 November
1940). Her words suggest that she was trying to invent a narrative form
that fused the random and accidental "pattern" of real life with the more
consciously constructed "pattern" of a work of art. Her wide reading of,
and many attempts to write, family memoirs had given her a sharp sense of
the difficulties and opportunities the form offered. And the long Stephen
tradition of producing them was worth carrying on if it could be radically
altered. That revision was a lifelong undertaking, far from completed at
the time of Woolf's death. There would never be a new master narrative,
in part because of her distrust of the very concept. But the discoveries
along the way&#8212;of unexplored subjects, of new methods, of the layered
nature of "the self"&#8212;had taken her far beyond the family archive,
including her own earliest attempts to contribute to it. Unfinished as it
is, Woolf's career-long experiment in autobiographical narrative might
serve later generations of writers who understood that this relatively
new literary form is rich in opportunities. Her interrupted life history,
even in its messy, permanently fragmented state, constitutes a legacy
of enduring interest to readers well beyond the particular family in
which it had its birth.

<p>
"What is to be gained, someone will surely ask, by having a Hottentot sing
into the phonograph, then taking this dubious work of art and dissecting
it with a tonometer and a metronome into its atomic parts?"<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  In his 1905 address "The Problems of Comparative Musicology," presented
  to the International Society for Musicology in Vienna, Erich Moritz
  von Hornbostel reframed what was already an old question in strikingly
  new terms. By the turn of the century, the Western fascination with
  non-Western music had an extensive history, documented in numerous
  accounts by travelers, missionaries, merchants, and scientists.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  These written accounts remind us that the unexpected component of
  Hornbostel's experiment was not the Hottentot, but the phonograph. The
  study of music had previously relied on source criticism, texts
  including hand-written scores and published manuscripts, whereas
  comparative musicology&#8212;a precursor to ethnomusicology&#8212;would
  become the first discipline based on sound recordings.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  Though Edison's "talking machine" commonly denoted pleasure,
  leisure, entertainment, and consumption, this device would now
  serve to establish the empirical basis for a comparative science of
  music. Thus the phonograph lured a new generation of scientists to
  revisit a familiar topos, the "primitive," embodied by the Hottentot.

<p>
Hornbostel phrased his question as a joke for an audience presumably
familiar with the re of Saartjie Baartman, a San woman who was
exhibited in the early nineteenth century as the "Hottentot Venus." Her
stage name itself was intended ironically, for, as Bernth Lindfors
explains, "in physique she little resembled

<b></b>

any European notion of classic beauty. Like many San women, she had
steatopygia, a greatly enlarged rump, which appears to have been the
single feature of her anatomy sensational enough to bring out crowds
to see her."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Spectators in London, where Baartman was displayed from 1810 to
  1811, described her performance as a kind of animal act, invoking
  and thereby reinforcing the idea of a biological continuum between
  humans and animals that organized her stage performance.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  The French naturalist Georges Cuvier conferred scientific authority
  upon this idea by comparing Baartman's physique to that of an
  orangutan. In this instance, as Sander Gilman has shown, what was
  deemed extraordinary corporeality implied racial and sexual degeneracy.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  When Baartman died in 1815, her body parts were dissected, dipped in
  wax, and exhibited at the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris. From the
  London stage to the Paris museum, the Hottentot Venus confirms that
  human displays occupied a tenuous space between the embodied and the
  disembodied, the living and the dead.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
Hornbostel proposed a new approach to this re, one that simultaneously
inverted certain conventions of her stage performance and elaborated
the logic of anatomical display. Rather than exhibit the Hottentot's
physicality, he recorded her music, preserved it in wax, and dissected
her song into its minutest parts. The phonograph offered a means of
hearing, examining, and representing the primitive in a new mode of
disembodiment, as a sound recording. Moreover, its capacity to inscribe
sound in a permanent and reproducible form&#8212;a wax cylinder or
phonogram&#8212;granted access to an acoustic realm that had previously
resisted perception.

<p>
This attempt to explore the imperceptible world by mechanical means was
one of many in the late nineteenth century. The French physiologist
&Eacute;tienne-Jules Marey had already used a battery of graphic,
photographic, and cinematographic devices for reproducing what the eye
could not see, recording the instantaneous movements of physical functions
such as muscle contractions, and analyzing their changes over time.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  Hornbostel distinguished his project from Marey's in two important
  ways: first, by his use of sound technology, and second, by his preoccupation
with the so-called primitive. This second point of distinction also led
Hornbostel, unlike Marey, to plot temporal change along an evolutionary
axis, charting the morphological and historical transformations of
music across the sweep of time and space. Even while scrutinizing
the tiniest fractions of a moment, as had Marey, Hornbostel imagined
himself traversing extended intervals of time: "We wish to uncover
the darkest and most distant past, to peel off the timeless and the
elemental from the fullness of the present; in other words, we want to
understand the evolution and the aesthetic foundation of music" ("PM,"
56). This programmatic statement inadvertently evokes the experience
of time at the cusp of the twentieth century&#8212;an experience that
the phonograph and the cinema helped transform. These inventions, as the
historian Stephen Kern has shown, "brought the past into the present more
than ever before," thereby expanding the present and giving it density.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  The thickened present offered Hornbostel a uniquely modern terrain
  for excavating the primitive past, and the phonograph served as
  his requisite tool for digging. By means of recording, he sought to
  extract from the Hottentot's song "the <i>primal</i> origins of music"
  (<i>die</i> Ur<i>anf&auml;nge der Musik</i>).
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
If the Hottentot Venus remains a familiar icon, the sound of her voice
has faded from memory. As modernists, our shared interest in the visual
has led us to overlook the historical impact of a discipline, indeed a
discourse, based on and dedicated to the preservation of sound.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Yet this phenomenon should be of interest to us, not only because it
  emphasizes the specificity of sound (which reminds us that problems of
  representing evolution are not restricted to vision), but also because
  it raises new questions about the formation of scientific discourse
  in the context of modern technology. This essay investigates the role
  of phonography in the nascent discipline of comparative musicology
  (<i>vergleichende Musikwissenschaft</i>).
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  In particular, it demonstrates how phonography could be imagined
  and employed as a discursive technique for rendering evolution
  audible&#8212;a technique, that is, for dissecting "primitive" songs
  and rebuilding them into evolutionary narratives. Sound technology
  helped transform music into information that could be used and
  distributed in a variety of ways. This essay therefore explores how
  listening becomes a scientific pursuit.

<p>
In examining the initial experiments of Hornbostel and his colleagues,
we access what Bruno Latour calls "science in action," in this case,
the making of ethnomusicology before the "field" even existed.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  We gain too a more nuanced understanding of how scientists
  shape their practice retroactively according to their use of
  new tools and techniques. Comparative musicologists found their
  own voice by experimenting with the phonograph and its popular
  discourse. Phonography helped create the necessary conditions for
  the ascent of comparative musicology, even while broadcasting the
  ostensible decline of that discipline's unique object of study, the
  loss of "original" music. By appropriating and modifying phonography
  for the purpose of conducting experimental research, comparative
  musicology reorganized scientific modes of representation; more
  importantly, though, it spoke on behalf of an entirely new principle
  of not seeing science&#8212;but hearing it. As I argue, Hornbostel
  and his colleagues represented their object of study as well as
  their ideas about it in acoustic terms, as a form of phonographic
  discourse. Today, if not in turn-of-the-century Germany, what was
  once a loud and audible fact threatens to fall on deaf ears. There
  was a moment when the ear had a purchase that the eye did not. As
  modernists, we need to listen to the sound of evolution: that of our
  own. Whether we think of ourselves as living in the information age
  or under the sign of globalization, the problems we confront in using
  new technologies to stake out interdisciplinary areas of scholarship
  are still linked to "the problems of comparative musicology" that
  Hornbostel addressed nearly a century ago.

  Founded in 1900 by Carl Stumpf, the archive was initially housed
  in the Psychology Institute, which Stumpf directed, at the Berlin
  University. A private institution funded largely by Hornbostel's
  estate and the few donations he and Stumpf could solicit, the phonogram
  archive was the first of its kind in Germany, although not the first
  in the world. In 1899

<b></b>

Sigmund Exner had established the Phonogram Archive of the Austrian
Academy of Sciences (das Phonogrammarchiv der &ouml;sterreichischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften) in Vienna. A scant year later, presumably
in response to its new competition, Exner would assert: "The collection
of musical performances of savage peoples may prove to be especially
fruitful for a comparative musicology, which would probably be made
possible in this way."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  Nevertheless, he set a Eurocentric agenda for the Vienna archive,
  concentrating on European languages and dialects, Western music,
  and on the voices of famous personalities, in that order of priority.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  Thus the Berlin Phonogram Archive made a name for itself by
  specializing in the collection of "exotic melodies" (<i>exotische
  Melodien</i>).

<p>
Stumpf and Hornbostel would later be recognized as the "founding
fathers" of the so-called Berlin School of Comparative Musicology,
but the historiographical emphasis on fathers and schools misses the
point. On one level, it locates Stumpf and his assistants retrospectively
in a disciplinary position that they never occupied. None had chairs in
comparative musicology (or for that matter in musicology). Trained in
philosophy, Stumpf held posts in psychology at W&uuml;rzburg, Prague,
Halle, and Munich, where he specialized in "psychoacoustics," before
landing at the Berlin University. His first full-time assistant in the
phonogram archive, Otto Abraham, was a successful Berlin physician, while
Hornbostel earned his doctorate in chemistry at the University of Vienna.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Each scholar initially worked outside of the boundaries that presumably
  circumscribed comparative musicology. Their peripheral position urges
  us to treat this project as interdisciplinary from the outset. Indeed,
  the question that Hornbostel and his coworkers asked of their object
  was "inextricably tied to the most general questions of musical
  history, ethnography, and psychology; its solution could only be
  approached through the cooperation of these sciences" ("BPM," 225).

<p>
On another level, school-driven approaches to comparative musicology
give short shrift to the sound archive as a "hearing institution" (or
<i>H&ouml;ranstalt</i>), as Hornbostel would call it. Mark Sandberg's
analysis of the folk museum and the cinema as "institutions of the
visible" is here instructive, emphasizing as it does the notion of "the
institution as discursive formation" in order to elicit the historical
as well as the metaphorical links between seemingly disparate visual
attractions.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  An analogous accent on the phonograph and the sound archive as
  "institutions of the audible" not only amplifies their discursive
  cross talk; it also demonstrates how they participated together in
  a larger economy of circulation.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
In 1908, when the Berlin Phonogram Archive had collected nearly one
thousand wax cylinders, Stumpf enumerated the various sources from which
they derived:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
They have come, first, from our own recordings of occasional performances
by exotic guests in the German Imperial capital; second, from recordings
made by traveling researchers, many of whom we equipped with phonographs
and instructions; third, from the exchange of copies with other archives
abroad; and fourth, from donations by the large phonographic companies
(Deutsche Grammophon, Favorit, Beka Records), which produce nearly
flawless recordings in the farthest reaches of the world for commercial
purposes.

<b></b>
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



Each of these sources&#8212;exhibitions, travelers, archives, and record
companies&#8212;represents but one channel in an emerging network of
circulation based on the mobility of recorded sound. Taken together,
they offer a glimpse of the vast infrastructure that Stumpf and his
assistants required for their collection project. "This work is at once
national and international [<i>v&ouml;lkerverkn&uuml;pfend</i>], for it
requires the cooperation of researchers from all civilized nations in
the service of common knowledge."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  By 1918, the archive would amass more than ten thousand recordings,
  making it the world's largest phonogram collection and the hub of
  a global exchange network. As Stumpf proclaimed a decade earlier,
  "If the center of such an undertaking is to exist anywhere in the
  world, then it must be in Berlin" ("BP," 83).

<p>
If the city was the inevitable location for an archive, it was also
the primary site for conducting ethnomusicological fieldwork avant la
lettre. The Berlin Phonogram Archive would rapidly expand its collections
with the rise of professional fieldwork, to be sure. At the turn of the
century, however, "traveling researchers" provided only one among many
sources of acoustic evidence. Generally, Stumpf and his assistants did
not themselves travel abroad. Between 1900 and 1912, they made their
earliest and most important recordings not in the colonies&#8212;but in
the metropolis. The music came to them. Live performances of non-Western
music could be heard throughout Berlin, where they played a key role in
the burgeoning industry of leisure and entertainment as stock features of
cabaret programs, circus shows, and ethnographic exhibitions. Though the
literature on nineteenth-century visual culture maintains an awkward
silence on issues of sound, music did not merely supplement these
entertainments. On the contrary, live performances of foreign music
were in at least one respect more sensational than the visual displays
that they accompanied: Europeans were already familiar with images of
cultural difference, brought to them through paintings and illustrations,
but ethnographic entertainments made the sounds of non-European life
available to mass audiences for the very first time.

<p>
Equipped with a phonograph, Stumpf and his assistants visited many of
the itinerant shows that came to Berlin. Here they recorded the music of
performing troupes from Thailand , Japan (1901, 1909), India ,
Togo , Tunisia , the Hopi pueblo , Sri Lanka ,
Cameroon , Sudan , Samoa , Senegambia , Somalia
, and northern Scandinavia , among other "exotic" locales. The
Berlin records were labeled "archive recordings" (<i>Archivaufnahmen</i>),
thus designating their status as the earliest collections in the Berlin
Phonogram Archive and the material basis for its establishment. The
recording sessions took place at several venues, including the Zoological
Garden and the Circus Busch (where human and animal shows intermingled),
the Central-Hotel and the Wintergarten (upper-end variety theaters), the
Passage-Panoptikum and Castan's Panoptikum (wax museums), the Velodrome
(a bicycle track that doubled as an outdoor exhibition site) and Luna Park
(an amusement park on the outskirts of the city).
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  In Hornbostel's words, "the primal origins of music" were excavated
  in the fairgrounds of modern Berlin. Only from the viewpoint of the
  urban center could one construct a comparative taxonomy of cultures
  or an evolutionary history of origins.

The Descent of Music
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
German comparative musicology took its opening cue from British
evolutionism. In 1885, Stumpf published the first German review of
"Music Psychology in England," a survey of the various theories of music
advanced by, among others, Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  Framing their work in terms of music psychology was admittedly
  problematic, for the distinctive claim of nineteenth-century
  evolutionary theory was, as Thomas Richards has shown, to calculate
  <i>all</i> things and arrange them in series of lineal development
  (<i>IA,</i> 48). At the same time, precisely because of its
  comprehensive scope, evolutionary theory had to explain the emergence
  of music or at least account for it in some way. Stumpf's review
  therefore concentrated on music's challenge to evolutionism (in the
  broadest sense) as an all-encompassing theory of origins. Though he
  surveyed a number of competing theories, Stumpf's use of Darwin is
  both important and indicative, for it served as a touchstone throughout
  his subsequent research and teaching. Darwin provides a key, that is,
  to Stumpf's own professional evolution as a comparative musicologist.

<p>
In <i>The Descent of Man</i> (1871, German translation 1875), Darwin
initially designated the existence of music as an evolutionary
conundrum: "As neither the enjoyment nor the capacity of producing musical notes
are faculties of the least use to man in reference to his daily habits
of life, they must be ranked amongst the most mysterious with which he
is endowed."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  Music seemed to defy explanation not least of all because Darwin
  addressed it as a question of reproduction. To be sure, music could
  neither reproduce itself nor struggle for survival. "Nevertheless,"
  wrote Stumpf, "Darwin knew what to do. His answer could be summarized
  as follows: 'In the beginning was love.'"
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  Darwin tried to resolve the predicament of music by inventing his own
  origin myth, one that referred back (tautologically) to the creative
  principle of descent. Music first appeared in the animal kingdom,
  he argued, where it functioned as a "primitive" form of sexual
  selection, homologous to the colorful plumage of a bird. That most
  birds "sing" rendered this homology doubly compelling, embodying
  and thereby naturalizing the link between the existence of music
  and the principle of sexual selection. "Although the sounds emitted
  by animals of all kinds serve many purposes, a strong case can be
  made out that the vocal organs were primarily used and perfected in
  relation to the propagation of the species. . . . Every one knows how
  much birds use their vocal organs as a means of courtship; and some
  species may likewise perform what may be called instrumental music"
  (<i>DM,</i> 875-6). By defining music as a kind of sexual lure,
  Darwin incorporated it into the more familiar laws of selection and
  inheritance that governed his own thesis of "descent by modification"
  first elaborated in <i>The Origin of Species</i>.

<p>
Darwin's theory of music rested on two assumptions that Stumpf found
equally preposterous: namely, that birds could be seen as evolutionary
ancestors of human beings, and that the "intermediate stages"
(<i>Zwischenstufen</i>) between man and his closest relatives could
also be found in music ("ME," 309). As Stumpf commented in a subsequent
lecture: "The much sought-after human ape can at least be imagined, if
not actually found," whereas a musical equivalent to the human ape or
"missing link" was

<b></b>

unimaginable.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  In other words, a freak of nature may exist&#8212;indeed, it
  must for Darwin&#8212;but there was no such thing as a freak of
  music. Nevertheless, this shift in Stumpf's interest from the
  origins to the intermediate stages was entirely consistent with
  nineteenth-century evolutionary thinking. As Richards notes,
  "The project of Darwinian morphology . . . fixed its sights on
  the grey areas between forms. It sought to verify the existence of
  forms between forms" (<i>IA,</i> 55). Once these liminal spaces were
  identified, the gaps in an evolutionary sequence could be filled,
  and the sequence rendered continuous. As we shall see, Stumpf and his
  assistants would take up this project by locating the gaps between
  ancient, "primitive," and modern music, and extrapolating the forms
  that ostensibly connected them.

<p>
Stumpf's critique of Darwin provided him with an occasion for redefining
music in the context of scientific positivism. What distinguished music
from "the sounds emitted by animals," Stumpf argued, was its formal
organization based on the interval, the variable difference in pitch
between two sounds. This had a number of important consequences. First,
the question of music became a specifically human one. The production
and the enjoyment of fixed intervals presupposed the capacity for
abstract thought, which was held to be uniquely human. Insofar as animal
sounds resembled musical intervals, that resemblance was coincidental,
a fortuitous expression of "the pleasure in sound as such, not the
pleasure in musical intervals" ("ME," 312-3). Second, the search for the
origins of music became synonymous with the search for the origins of
musical intervals. "Somewhere, somehow, intervals must have been invented
(even by the mysterious human ape, if you like), and thus began music"
("ME," 313-4). This new exploration would still involve identifying the
existence of gaps between forms in order to fill them retrospectively, but
the developmental sequence that it aimed to reconstruct would encompass
only humans. The leap across the perceived divide between humans and
animals was one that Stumpf himself refused to make. Moreover, rather
than calculate all things that ever existed, he would concentrate on
musical forms in particular. In so doing, Stumpf established a modified
notion of evolution, one that maintained a strict separation between
humans and animals. His appropriation of the discourse of evolution
redefined its parameters for an exact science of music.

<p>
On the most basic level, however, Darwin's "lack of an empirical
foundation" pointed to a gap in the discourse itself ("ME," 308). Stumpf
was not alone in his objection. Throughout the 1870s, Germany's leading
anthropologists, Adolf Bastian and Rudolf Virchow, made this same argument
in their reviews of Darwin's books as well as in their famous dispute
with Darwin's German popularizer, Ernst Haeckel.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Bastian and Virchow took this as grounds for discarding evolution
  entirely, focusing instead on the "elementary ideas" of humanity and
  the multiplicity of cultural forms that issued from those ideas. What
  makes Stumpf's 1885 review so remarkable, then, is that it begins with
  a typically German critique of British science, but arrives at an
  unexpected conclusion: Rather than dismiss Darwin's claims in toto,
  Stumpf would adopt the evolutionary assumption, while concentrating
  his own efforts on gathering "facts" about the origins of music in
  order to rectify the dearth of empirical research.

<b></b>

<p>
Countering Darwin's conjectures with hard evidence demanded wide-scale
recording, collecting, and cataloging. It called, in other words, for
the building of an archive. However Stumpf differed from anti-Darwinists
in German anthropology, all agreed that the historical development of
culture could be directly apprehended through the study of "primitive"
peoples. As Darwin himself noted, "We see the musical faculties, which
are not wholly deficient in any race, are capable of prompt and high
development, for Hottentots and Negroes have become excellent musicians,
although in their native countries they rarely practice anything that
we should consider music" (<i>DM,</i> 878-9). Stumpf set out to find
his own informants.

Acoustic Selection
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Here is a primal scene of comparative musicology: Nine Bella Coola
Indians perform a "Cannibal Dance" before a long-pole lodge. They sing
while beating drums, shaking rattles, and rhythmically stomping their
feet. A group of scientists, seated before them, watches and listens. This
scene&#8212;and its audience is part of the spectacle&#8212;would be
repeated numerous times not in British Columbia, where the performers
originated, but in Berlin, Cologne, Dresden, Hamburg, Leipzig,
and other German cities. From 1885 to 1886, Carl Hagenbeck, the
consummate showman of Imperial Germany, exhibited his latest troupe
of ethnographic performers not only for urban crowds, but also for
scientific experts. While the Bella Coola drew mixed reactions from
commercial audiences (for whom they looked "too European"), for Germany's
scientific elite they were sensational in every sense of the word.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
In November of 1885, the troupe made a special appearance before the
Institute for Geography at the University of Halle (<a name="1"
HREF="10.2ames_res.html#1"> 1</a>). Here, Stumpf intended
to conduct his first experiment in the psychology of non-Western music,
beginning the empirical research needed to support an evolutionary theory
of music.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  While his colleagues watched the performers, Stumpf was poised to
  transcribe the music by hand. He would fail. Stumpf describes his
  uneasy sense of drowning in the performance, "swimming" in a turbulent
  sea of unfamiliar sounds.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  The spectacle wrenched this listener from his position of cool
  detachment, immersing him in a sensory riot. "As the actors grew more
  passionate," he remarks, "the musical intervals, whose arrangement
  is in many ways unfamiliar to our ears, became increasingly
  unintelligible" ("LBI," 406). Though Stumpf took Native American
  music seriously, its apparent inscrutability seemed to corroborate the
  absolute distinction between European "art music" (<i>Tonkunst</i>)
  and non-European "natural music" (<i>nat&uuml;rliche Musik</i>) that
  Eduard Hanslick had drawn in 1854: "When South Sea Islanders rattle
  wooden sticks rhythmically, while sounding out an incomprehensible
  howl [<i>ein unfa&szlig;liches Geheul</i>], that is <i>natural</i>
  music, because it is not music at all."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  Stumpf's initial impression of the Bella Coola gave him no obvious
  reason to challenge this received idea; nor did his fragmentary
  transcriptions of their music offer any evidence to the contrary.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  The ethnographic exhibition had issued in a disorienting barrage
  of sensory stimuli that initially resisted transcription. As a
  stenographer, Stumpf had tested his powers of hearing and notation,
  and failed on both accounts.

<b></b>

<p>
Yet the problems of aural perception and acoustic legibility
only served to heighten the scientist's curiosity. After the
performance, Stumpf gained permission from Hagenbeck's agents,
Captain Johan Adrian Jacobsen and his brother Fillip, to have
a private audience with one of the singers, Nuskilusta (see <A
HREF="10.2ames_res.html#1"> 1</a>).
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  They spent four evenings together in the Institute, working for one
  to two hours at a time. While Nuskilusta rehearsed the troupe's
  various songs more than ten times each, Stumpf plodded ahead
  with his hand-written scores ("LBI," 407). These private recitals
  differed in important ways from the public exhibitions; as Stumpf
  noted in his report, "Nuskilusta stopped rattling a piece of wood
  in his hand when he noticed that it disturbed me" ("LBI," 409). Such
  modifications could, he acknowledged, potentially distort the results
  of his experiment. "Nuskilusta kept the tempo slow, perhaps out
  of consideration for me, but also because [the solo performance]
  lacked the same effect that was produced by the collective singing
  and dancing" ("LBI," 408). Problems of this kind could be resolved
  by what he defined as precise means of measurement: "At home, then,
  working from memory, I determined the tempo with a metronome, which one
  can do with great reliability" ("LBI," 408-9). During the day, he also
  attended the Bella Coola's public shows at a local beer garden, where
  he checked his revised transcriptions against the choral performances.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  Hours of intensive listening began to pay off, he observed, for "now
  I could hear more than mere howling; I could hear the melodies just
  as Nuskilusta had sung them <i>solo</i>" ("LBI," 408; italics in
  original). The isolation and repetition of the individual singer's
  voice allowed Stumpf to train and adapt his aural response to the
  unfamiliar texture of Bella Coola music. If a melody

<b></b>

could be picked out from the "howling," then the strict separation
between European art music and natural music must be, Stumpf reasoned,
at once willed and tenuous. "With respect to music, we should not speak
too offhandedly of 'wild, uncultivated' peoples."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
The blatant staginess of Hagenbeck's show did not undermine its
"authenticity" for Stumpf. On the contrary, it shook his faith in
travelogues and scientific studies that relied on acoustic evidence
gathered abroad.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  Claiming the authority of having "been there," travelers often
  presented full scores of non-European music, but consistently elided
  any mention of the methodological problems of transcription. While
  some had little or no training in musical notation, even the most
  gifted or meticulous stenographers, as travelers who were merely
  "passing through," had virtually no opportunity to double-check
  their work. Ironically, ethnographic exhibitions chipped away at
  the legitimacy of travelogues, poking holes in their facade of
  completeness.

<p>
For an expert in psychoacoustics, Stumpf's experiment confirmed
that listening habits were not merely subjective, but culturally
conditioned. Nineteenth-century audiences in Germany (and elsewhere)
heard non-Western music in many and sometimes conflicting ways. Listeners
such as Hanslick dismissed "natural music" as "not music at all"; on
the opposite end of the spectrum, others failed to apprehend its status
as non-Western. Stumpf and his assistants repeatedly cautioned against
what they understood as the common tendency "to hear with European ears,"
that is, to treat non-European music as though it were based on familiar
structures of harmony.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  This tendency was of particular concern for the stenographer, whose
  predicament Stumpf described by way of a visual analogy:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When one leafs through old, illustrated travelogues, one is amazed at
the Europeanized facial features of "savages," as they used to be called
(despite the exaggerated family resemblance to Europeans). It was simply
not possible for draftsmen to see objectively; and, for all of their
naturalism, it remains impossible for them to do so today. The pencil is
guided not by the eye, but by the brain, in which the accustomed facial
features leave a lasting impression. ["BP," 65-6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The creation of residual images, he suggested, had an acoustic corollary
in what we might call residual sounds, echoes of harmony that faintly
ring in "European ears." If this penchant for hearing diatonically was
an inadvertent effect of subjective perception, however, it was also
a problem that one could correct. "To free oneself from such habits,"
Hornbostel stated in his 1905 report, "requires a special practice,
a training <i>ad hoc</i>" ("PM," 50). Researchers would have to attune
themselves (literally) to musical alterity, while casting away more
familiar ways of listening. Insofar as aural training depended not
on source criticism (e.g., musical transcription), but on extensive
exposure to live music, it also required an unprecedented degree of
access to non-European peoples.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Around 1900, access and availability provided a rationale for making
  repeated visits to local, urban entertainments, where scientists
  could simultaneously recalibrate their sense of hearing and develop
  a corresponding method of "objective" representation ("TMS," 170).

<b></b>

<p>
Rather than speculate on the significance of Bella Coola songs, Stumpf set
out to transcribe them: "It was our intention to provide only phonographic
reproductions of the audible [<i>phonographische Nachbildungen des
Geh&ouml;rten</i>], so to speak, not theoretical observations" ("LBI,"
424). In this instance, "phonographic reproductions" alluded not to
Edison's talking machine (which Stumpf had yet to employ), but to the
idea of nonarbitrary writing, or "phonography," as it was understood
in the mid-nineteenth century. As James Lastra notes, "the very term
'phonography' initially referred to a stenographic system developed
by Isaac Pitman in 1837, which, by transcribing <i>sounds</i> instead
of words, was expected to offer a more direct, almost analogical form
of writing."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  Though Stumpf would use a conventional form of musical notation,
  Pitman's system appealed to him as an ideal mode of acoustic
  representation and shaped his own discourse on non-Western music. The
  search for an objective means of recording, unmediated by the presence
  of the stenographer, would propel Stumpf throughout his career.

<p>
The results of this first experiment augured well for the success of
future research. The ethnographic exhibition provided ample resources for
analyzing the rhythmic organization and melodic texture of Bella Coola
music. Stumpf concluded that Nuskilusta employed a coherent "tone system"
based on a five-step musical scale, which "must have been the result
of a cultural development [<i>eine geistige Entwicklung</i>]." Not
only did this suggest that the Bella Coola possessed a concept of
musical intervals&#8212;a claim, as we have seen, that supported his
critique of Darwin. In addition to its manifest importance for music
psychology, it led Stumpf to assert his project's ethnographic potential:
"In time, such studies will also acquire anthropological significance,
beyond their musicological value, inasmuch as they identify new traits
[<i>Kennzeichen</i>] for establishing the relationship or interaction
between different tribes" ("LBI," 405). Most importantly, this conclusion
brought European and non-European music into calculable proximity. Radical
new comparisons could now be made and even verified. One evening,
after listening to Nuskilusta, Stumpf attended a recital of Bach's High
Mass, where he experienced an epiphany indeed: Perhaps the "expansion"
(<i>Ausdehnung</i>) of different evolutionary stages could be charted
in terms of musical intervals, he proposed, by "measuring the distance
between Bach and Nuskilusta" ("LBI," 426). Thus Stumpf imagined a much
larger and more ambitious project, an evolutionary science of music.

<p>
This evolutionary imaginary, it must be stressed, was entirely a
function of spectatorship, for Hagenbeck's display made no attempt to
construe evolution visually. On the contrary, the Bella Coola show,
like so many of Hagenbeck's ethnographic exhibitions, was modeled on
the variety program, with its "montage" of dance numbers, magic acts,
and musical performances. Rather than organize human displays as visual
corollaries of Darwinian narratives, Hagenbeck choreographed a diverse
series of kinetic and multisensory attractions. He further distinguished
himself as an ethnographic showman by representing "typical" scenes of
everyday life in foreign lands. In the context of urban entertainment,
Hagenbeck's practice of hyperbolic collection&#8212;importing vast
numbers of humans, animals, plants, objects, and entire buildings, all

<b></b>

for the purpose of display&#8212;served mainly to render the exotic
accessible to mass audiences.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  At the same time, his insistence on the "authentic" and the "typical"
  appealed to an elite group of anthropologists (led by Bastian and
  Virchow), whose approval Hagenbeck needed in order to legitimate his
  own ethnographic enterprise. However the entrepreneur excelled at
  "managing" an entire network of discourses on the exotic, these
  discourses would exceed his control. A spectator such as Stumpf,
  who brought with him a different set of goals and expectations,
  would hear the performances as living evidence of evolution.

<p>
Stumpf's "first encounter" with the Bella Coola offers a preview of what
it would take to render evolution audible with the aid of a phonograph
(and a productive analogy to what would later be known as fieldwork).
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  It demonstrates, in particular, how listening functions as a
  scientific technique. In order to render the Bella Coola's music
  legible and comprehensible, Stumpf had to reduce the ensemble to a
  solo singer. Further, the props and stage settings of Hagenbeck's
  show&#8212;the elements that the impresario had used to create a
  convincing expression of exotic space and to immerse spectators in
  the depicted scene&#8212;were deliberately screened out of the private
  recitals. In their place, Stumpf constructed a new performance context,
  one specially designed for inscribing sounds in isolation. But which
  sounds counted as music, and which ones as noise? Distinguishing a melody from "mere howling" required still other acts of
acoustic reduction and selection. On the one hand, noises that "disturbed"
the stenographer (the shaking of rattles and stomping of feet) needed to
be eliminated. On the other hand, the musical rudiments that intrigued
him (melody, rhythm, and intonation) had to be identified, amplified,
and repeated. Only by restaging the musical performance in its entirety
and manipulating the terms of its occasion&#8212;now with the solo
singer repeating particular notes or passages upon request&#8212;could
the stenographer produce the effects of acoustic legibility and
"objectivity" that he would claim for his transcriptions. Acoustic
objectivity was therefore a function not of the distance between science
and entertainment, but of the power to choreograph. As "participant
observer," the scientist became a kind of impresario in his own right.

<p>
In 1887, Stumpf ran a similar experiment at Hagenbeck's Ceylon
Exhibition in Berlin. Not until 1900, when he and his new assistants at
the Psychology Institute equipped themselves with a phonograph, would
they find a writing system that met the standards of a science committed
to positivism. By that time, the crisis of legibility had acquired new
meaning in the context of imperialism and mass culture. The expansion of
the German empire, and particularly its acquisition of colonies between
1884 and 1900, posed an immediate threat to the existence of indigenous
music. The question now was whether sound technology would preserve such
music or, conversely, hasten its demise.

<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  At the same time, the global logic of

<b></b>

access and connectedness gave rise to new anxieties about the consequences
of too much proximity. Throughout their writings, Stumpf and Hornbostel
would take turns lamenting the "annihilation," "homogenization," and
"modernization" of non-European music. They consistently emphasized
two interrelated forces of transformation, namely, colonialism and
circulation. In so doing, however, comparative musicologists assailed
the infrastructure that made possible not only the ethnographic
exhibition&#8212;their initial source of data&#8212;but also their own
still nascent discipline.

<p>
Paradoxically, Stumpf and his assistants advocated the wide-scale
collection of non-European music in reaction to imperialist
expansion. "The more relentlessly European culture invades foreign parts
of the earth and drives declining forms [of music] if not also their
carriers to the brink of extinction, the more it is time to collect and
study them" ("TMS," 167). The conquest of space rendered time of the
essence. That was precisely the logic that Adolf Bastian had employed
in his 1881 call for an ethnological museum in Berlin:
"The existence of natural peoples is for us only ephemeral; that is, they
exist for us only insofar as our knowledge of them and our relationships
to them are concerned. The moment that they meet us, the angel of death
is upon them. From then on, struck by the angel, they carry the seed of
decline within them."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  Bastian's apocalyptic vision of "first contact" invokes the notion of
  biological contagion; colonialism was the virus within the bloodstream
  of native peoples.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  Thus Bastian and Stumpf each prescribed the antidote of immediate
  collection and preservation. They understood collection not as
  a protest against colonialism, but as a reflection of Germany's
  imperial power, a commitment to the stewardship of its colonies and
  resources. Imperial prestige and custodianship here meant, above all,
  funding and maintaining urban institutions, from the Royal Museum
  of Ethnology, which was established in 1886, to the Berlin Phonogram
  Archive.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Comparative musicologists reacted in equally paradoxical fashion against
modern systems of circulation. In 1908, Stumpf predicted that music
"will in the future belong to the indispensable signs that will inform
us about contacts among the peoples and tribes of the earth&#8212;their
relationships, migrations, and trade connections&#8212;provided that we
do not wait until the expansion of world traffic [<i>Weltverkehr</i>] has
obscured all of their characteristic differences" ("BP," 75-6). Reports
from abroad seemed to verify what Stumpf had surmised in Berlin, where
the networks of circulation had already transformed urban experience in
tangible ways. Shortly before the outbreak of World War I, for instance,
Albert Schweitzer wrote a letter to Stumpf in which he described the
scene in Gabon, Africa: "Motorboats are increasingly replacing rowboats,
as the foreign trading posts prefer them. In the foreseeable future
there will no longer be any day-long journeys by rowboat, with twenty
men in a canoe standing one behind the other, singing in order to keep
time in their rowing, i.e. end of the rowing song."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  For Schweitzer it seemed that the motor of modernity would overpower
  the "natural rhythms" of native life, leaving in its wake traditional
  means of transportation and their corresponding forms of cultural
  expression. The doctor's letter not only confirmed Stumpf's own
  diagnosis; it conveyed urgency to comparative musicology as a
  salvage operation. As Hornbostel quipped in his Vienna lecture:
  "We must rescue what there

<b></b>

is left to rescue, before the airship reaches the automobile and the
electric speed-train, before we hear Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-Der-&Eacute; in all
of Africa and The Beautiful Song of Little Cohn in the South Seas."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  The last vestiges of "original" music had to be collected and
  preserved, he declared, before new technologies of transportation
  and communication delivered mass culture to the colonies.

<p>
As the sardonic references to popular Western music were meant to suggest,
Hornbostel feared that the dissemination of gramophone records in the
colonies would "contaminate" his data at the source. "The coming of
Christianity spreads European church songs everywhere, the introduction of
school lessons our folk songs, the colonial troops our military marches,
and the gramophones of the colonials our worst popular hits. But what,
we ask, gets lost along the way?" ("EM," 91). Part of the problem, he and
his colleagues believed, was that "primitive peoples have a remarkable
talent for imitation and assimilation."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  This penchant for mimicry, so the argument ran, made colonized peoples
  especially susceptible to losing their own traditions. Paradoxically,
  then, non-European music had to be rescued from the people who
  created it. Imitation and assimilation represented more than a loss of
  "originality," in all senses of the word. They posed a threat to the
  order of things&#8212;the evolution of music&#8212;at precisely the
  moment when comparative musicologists began to chart it. Unless drastic
  measures were taken to preserve non-European music in its "original"
  form, went the logic, it would rapidly and irreversibly mutate beyond
  recognition. The solution was not simply to deploy one mobility system
  (sound technology) against others (planes, trains, and automobiles),
  for the circulation of "canned" music only exacerbated this crisis
  of originality. From the beginning, Emil Berliner's gramophone was
  primarily designed for playback rather than recording. Therefore,
  while sound technology ostensibly offered a solution, its prime
  instrument, the gramophone, promoted mimicry and in so doing threw
  "originality" back into question. The circulation of gramophone
  records in the colonies was simply too effective. In such a context,
  the Deutsche Grammophon Company's famous trademark, "The Recording
  Angel," represented no longer a modern form of transcendence, but in
  Bastian's terms a new "angel of death."

<p>
As key forms of technology and mass culture, the gramophone and the
phonograph participated in the very crisis that comparative musicologists
considered a threat to music's existence. In at once lamenting and
requiring them, Stumpf and Hornbostel held deeply ambivalent attitudes
toward modern techniques of circulation. These attitudes shaped
their project in crucial ways, beginning with their choice of sound
technology. If the gramophone potentially garbled the sound of evolution,
how could the phonograph but do otherwise?

<p>
Unlike the gramophone, Edison's invention permitted every user to record
sound as well as to reproduce it. In his 1878 article "The Phonograph and
Its Future," Edison foresaw "the almost universal applicability of the
[machine's] foundation principle, namely, the gathering up and retaining
of sounds hitherto fugitive, and their reproduction at will."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  In comparative musicology&#8212;a context unavailable to
  Edison&#8212;the principle of recording and reproduction would indeed
  resound. On the most basic level, the phonograph's dual function
  enabled Hornbostel and his colleagues to distinguish

<b></b>

conceptually between playback and recording: Whereas mass reproduction
threatened to "homogenize" non-European music, recording promised to
"fix" or "capture" that music in all its particularity. Thus phonography
offered a unique means of preserving the alterity of "exotic melodies,"
which is to say, a means of constructing it technologically and
discursively.

<p>
To understand how the phonograph could be mobilized "ethnographically," we
must acknowledge its difference as a medium. In one sense, phonography had
a greater impact on late-nineteenth-century audiences than photography,
for the latter medium could be seen, as Mark Sandberg suggests, "as a
refinement of realistic trends in painting and illustration, in which
the displacement of the visually depicted object in space and time was
a common enough phenomenon. But in phonography, the displacement of
the acoustic world through recording technology was truly astounding
and unprecedented."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
  To be sure, its novelty made Edison's invention a source of public
  fascination, if not an instant commercial success.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  From 1878 through the late 1880s, Edison rented the earliest models
  of his talking machine to professional entertainers, who demonstrated
  its wonders at traveling shows and world's fairs.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
  Like Hagenbeck's ethnographic exhibition, Edison's invention teetered
  between science and sensation, and too, in order to be refunctionalized
  for ethnography, the phonograph, like the ethnographic exhibition,
  would have to be stripped of its sensational qualities. By the turn
  of the century, its novelty had waned, to be replaced by new modes
  of curiosity. In 1896, the inaugural issue of <i>The Phonoscope</i>
  would predicate its own novelty on the fact that its subject matter
  was now pass&eacute;, and therefore interesting at a previously
  unimagined level:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Talking Machines have long since passed the point of novelty,
occupying today a foremost place among the standard inventions of this
progressive age. . . . The curiosity of hearing a machine talk has given
way to a more serious consideration, and today the general public is
convinced of its great possibilities, and is prepared to welcome its
entrance into practical utility in almost any sphere. The Phonograph has
made its way into many institutions, where it is used for educational
and scientific purposes.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Though the phonograph's social function had indeed undergone
transformation, this claim to its universal acceptance was
premature. Stumpf and Hornbostel still had to assure their
audiences&#8212;spanning popular lectures, newspaper articles, and
official correspondences&#8212;that they used the device as not a
mass-cultural source of aesthetic pleasure, but a scientific instrument.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  A German advertisement maintained as late as 1896 that "the best
  display object is and remains a good phonograph."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  Just as the talking machine was leaving the fairground and entering
  the bourgeois household, where it would be domesticated as a piece
  of furniture, comparative musicologists tried to move it into the
  scientific laboratory.

<p>
Retooling the phonograph for the study of "exotic melodies" required a
series of discursive maneuvers, for the talking machine was initially
intended not for music, but the human voice. The late-nineteenth-century
discourse on the phonograph revolved around the medium's claim to give
voice to the dead. As Edison's coworker and publicist

<b></b>

Edward H. Johnson famously stated, "A strip of indented paper travels
through a little machine, the sounds of the latter are magnified,
and our great grandchildren or posterity centuries hence hear us as
plainly as if we were present. Speech has become, as it were, immortal."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
  The phonograph promised to overcome the ephemerality of the body for
  the benefit of future generations. Thus conceived, it functioned as
  a kind of time capsule, preserving the voices of famous individuals
  like Gladstone, Bismarck, and other "immortals." Vienna's Phonogram
  Archive intended, for instance, to "bottle up all the noise of the
  century" by securing "personal statements of distinguished men."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  This fascination with speaking across generations extended into the
  domestic household, fulfilling Edison's prediction that the apparatus
  would become a unique family record: "For the purpose of preserving
  the sayings, the voices, and <i>the last words</i> of the dying
  member of a family&#8212;as of great men&#8212;the phonograph will
  unquestionably outrank the photograph."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
  In 1900, <i>The Phonoscope</i> would concur: "Death has lost some of
  its sting since we are able to forever retain the voices of the dead."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

<p>
This discourse on the phonograph deeply resonated with Stumpf and
Hornbostel, who selectively modified its key tropes and inflected them
ethnologically. Rather than concentrate on the individual voices of
distinguished men or loved ones, comparative musicologists gathered the
"collective" sounds of non-European music. In so doing, they employed
the metonymic logic of ethnographic exhibition, where the individual body
of the performer represented the larger, absent whole (or "people"). By
virtue of metonymy, "voices of the dead" came to describe the songs of
entire, allegedly vanishing, populations. "Unlike physics or literary
history, archaeology or polar research," wrote Hornbostel, "studies whose
object are so-called natural peoples cannot be put off for decades or
even years. As we know, the last Athapaskan or the last Pueblo Indian
will soon have followed the last of the Mohicans to the eternal hunting
grounds" ("EM," 90-1). Music's ephemeral quality compounded the problem
of studying non-Western peoples. Comparative musicology was thus endowed
with a sense of mimetic urgency unmatched by anthropology. "The tangible
products of non-European cultures are collected in ethnological museums,
as completely as is possible today. But just as rapidly as these products
disappear&#8212;indeed, more rapidly&#8212;word and sound fade away."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
  Hornbostel and his fellow archivists sought the advantages of
  phonography in order to rescue the doubly fugitive: the fleeting
  sounds of vanishing peoples.


<h3>

The Shape of Evolution
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In his 1885 essay "The Scope, Method, and Aim of Musicology," the German
scholar Guido Adler explains the new discipline's analytical approach
in archaeological terms: "When a work of art is under consideration,
it must first of all be defined palaeologically. If it is not written in
our notation, it must be transcribed. Already in this process significant
criteria for determining the work's time of origin may be gained. Then
its structural nature is examined."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  The first step in this procedure is to establish the chronological
  origin of a musical piece, as a natural scientist would determine
  the age of a fossil record or a geological stratum. Adler goes on to
  describe each subsequent

<b></b>

step in anatomical and evolutionary terms. "His style-critical method
begins with an anatomical dissection of a work of art in order to
ascertain its species, and his framing of stylistic laws can, in a sense,
be equated with determining the laws of musical 'natural selection.'"
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
  In his own programmatic statement on "The Problems of Comparative
  Musicology," Hornbostel studiously employs the metaphors of
  archaeology, anatomy, and evolution that Adler had used earlier. The
  comparative orientation itself was, as Hornbostel noted, a "general
  method" adapted from anatomy, zoology, and linguistics in order to
  create a new area of study. "The comparative method came late to
  musicology, because its object, in contrast to that of all other
  fields, had been relatively difficult to collect" ("PM," 41). That
  changed with the introduction of the phonograph. Now one could not
  merely collect non-Western music en masse, but "dissect" a particular
  song, "lay bare" its inner structure, compare it with that of other
  songs, and thereby extrapolate the morphological development of
  music around the world ("PM," 42, 56). In comparative musicology,
  the evolution of music would take shape in and take its shape from
  the act of recording. Its specific conration depended, however,
  upon the kind of narrative that Hornbostel and his colleagues sought
  to construct. Phonography allowed them to speak of a body of music,
  and to shape it discursively into various forms.

<p>
To speak of a body of music was, in this context, to assert its
solidity. Recording technology granted new materiality to sound,
allowing "exotic melodies" to be handled in Hornbostel's words as
"tangible products." In so doing, phonography brought music into
the realm of material culture. In acquiring the status of an object,
non-Western music could be collected, transported, exchanged, and stored
as never before. It seemed too, at least for a moment, that music itself
would warrant&#8212;and indeed be capable of occupying&#8212;a space of
display. In 1903, the Berlin anthropologist Felix von Luschan proposed
that the Royal Museum of Ethnology, where he served as head curator of
the Africa and Oceania sections, install phonographs next to showcases
of musical instruments. Recorded music, he claimed, should supplement
visual displays, amplifying objects that would otherwise remain mute,
and thereby enhancing the museum's sensory appeal to audiences.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  Stumpf voiced the same idea in his 1908 plea for donations to the sound
  archive: "Without the help of the phonograph, we are left standing
  before the museum showcase, in which instruments are preserved
  silent as the grave, full of wonder but empty of understanding"
  ("BP," 67). The uncanny little machine would transform the displayed
  instruments by bringing them back to life. However much this idea may
  have fascinated the public, Stumpf's call for support went unheeded. In
  contrast to the ethnological museum, the phonogram archive was not
  dedicated to the exhibition of things; rather, it was a laboratory
  and a storehouse that had little to do with the public sphere and
  everything to do with the scientific community.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Even if recorded music were given a place in the museum (it was not),
  Luschan presumed that its content would immediately dissolve into the
  showcase, to be contained by the visual display of instruments (the
  center of attention). Only at the sound archive would the phonogram
  be handled as a material object in its own right.

<b></b>

<p>
The materiality of the phonogram consisted of grooves engraved in a wax
cylinder. Edison's patented "hill-and-dale recording" technique inscribed
sound vertically into the surface of a rotating cylinder, endowing it
with depth as well as solidity. Scientific interest in phonographic
inscriptions noted their indexical quality, the embodied relationship
between the sound emitted and its material trace. Unlike earlier talking
machines, such as P. T. Barnum's Euphonia, which simulated speech
mechanically, the phonograph registered the <i>physical</i> impressions
of sound vibrations. Rather than inscribe sound in terms of language or
symbolic notation, its stylus etched lines and points into wax; that is,
it did not translate, but transcribe. Edison's device was distinguished
from other "writing systems," as Friedrich Kittler puts it, in that
"only the phonograph can record all the noise produced by the larynx
prior to any semiotic order and linguistic meaning."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  For Stumpf, the device offered a seemingly impartial method of
  gathering "raw data," unfiltered by "European ears" and unmediated
  by musical notation, thereby fulfilling the search for a nonarbitrary
  writing system he had begun in 1885.

<p>
By the same token, its indexical quality made the phonograph an ideal
technique for recording the music of oral cultures in particular, for
this music had never been set to writing. The absence of documentation
had already served German anthropology as a key criterion for defining
its object as "peoples without writing" (<i>schriftlose V&ouml;lker</i>).
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  The history of oral cultures could not, of course, be found in
  written sources. Instead, anthropologists assumed it was embedded in
  the material traces, such as tribal artifacts, that "peoples without
  writing" did in fact produce.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
  Comparative musicologists made the same assumption of their own object
  of study. That some non-European cultures apparently had no system
  of musical notation only served to justify the discipline's initial
  emphasis on recording as opposed to source criticism, for the latter
  method (advocated by Adler) presupposed the availability of musical
  "compositions."
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
  Sound technology rendered the history of non-Western music
  apprehensible not by supplying the missing manuscripts, but by
  producing a body of music that could be analyzed and measured as a
  physiological fact of the acoustic world. Stumpf and his assistants
  believed that evidence of evolution was hidden in the structure of
  "exotic melodies," which included&#8212;and depended upon&#8212;that
  of contemporary performances. A temporal medium par excellence, the
  phonograph offered a means of accessing the past through the sound
  of the present.

<p>
Abraham and Hornbostel correctly identified the phonograph's "special
advantage" as its capacity to manipulate sound as a function of time. Upon
playback, a record&#8212;indeed a single note&#8212;could be slowed
down, sped up, and endlessly repeated; a fragment of music could thus
be isolated, divided into its constituent parts, measured and analyzed
("BPM," 229). Retooled for the laboratory, the phonograph served as
a kind of surgical instrument. Hornbostel made no bones about it: "By
carefully segmenting and dissecting the melodic strand with a scalpel
[<i>Seziermesser</i>]&#8212;some people fundamentally condemn such
vivisection&#8212;we make the flow clot. The living event must be fixed
as a motionless corpse, and only thus is it possible to recognize the
now visible architecture of the whole."
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
  To <i>listen</i> with the aid of a phonograph was to <i>see</i> a body

<b></b>

of music, just as a doctor would observe a cadaver, splayed and flayed,
its internal structure exposed.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
  Here was a technique for locating and extracting what Hornbostel
  called the primal origins of music. Controlling the flow of sound
  allowed him to examine it in depth.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
  As a result of recording, that is, the phonograph rendered musical
  performance available to other "physical-acoustic methods" such as
  the tonometer, a device that measured the frequency of an individual
  pitch in "cents" or hundredths of a semitone. In combining analogue
  and digital technologies (the phonograph and the tonometer,
  respectively), Abraham and Hornbostel demonstrated how recorded
  music could be quantified, calculated, and compared. This surgical
  operation made it possible to survey a body of music in its entirety,
  to identify resemblances and differences with other "exotic melodies,"
  and thus to establish a discourse of comparative musicology&#8212;a
  discourse that extended beyond morphology to posit larger, cultural
  and historical connections.

<p>
For all its promise, the phonograph could not speak for itself.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
  Hornbostel and his fellow archivists amassed thousands of records,
  none of which articulated the interpretation of the music it
  contained. Once dissected, the body of music had to be reassembled
  discursively. Representing the evolution of music required comparative
  musicologists to reconre their object once again, now in terms
  of narrative.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
  As a "physical-acoustic method," phonography established an object
  solid enough to meet the demands of scientific positivism, yet
  malleable enough to substantiate a diversity of theoretical claims.

<p>
Stumpf's 1909 public lecture series <i>The Origins of Music</i> offers
a case in point. In the first part, a reprise of his earlier article
on British evolutionism, Stumpf offers up his own, characteristically
"German" theory of origins. With a nod to Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, he
proclaims: "In the beginning was the deed." Music began, in other words,
with the creative act of sending signals (<i>Signalgebung</i>). In order
to make this hypothesis, he posits the existence of "pre-historic humans"
(<i>Urmenschen</i>). "How did they come to employ a fixed musical
interval?" When a single voice failed to be heard, Stumpf speculated,
many voices must have joined in, thereby amplifying the sound and
inadvertently creating the first experience of consonance. While the
chorus of voices presumably included a range of pitches, creating any
number of possible combinations, only one combination produces an effect
that could be taken for a single, unified tone: the octave. The original
chorus must have noticed this apparent unity and eventually come to prefer
it. Stumpf goes on to posit the stepwise development of other consonant
intervals, beginning with the smallest and least complex, fourths and
fifths, which he attributes to non-Western music in particular. "Even
in civilized Europe one can observe that natural peoples produce fifths
when they try to sing in unison."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
  To show how this theory plays out, Stumpf organized his subsequent
  lectures around a series of phonogram demonstrations, offering the
  public a rare chance to hear recordings from the Berlin Phonogram
  Archive. His introduction is worth quoting at length, for it
  complicates the evolutionary assumption on which his theory rested:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We begin the series with the most primitive songs that are available and
known to us, those of the Vedda in Ceylon. We will order what follows,
however, not according to the

<b></b>

principle of progressive development. Instead, we will pursue a
geographical trajectory from Ceylon eastward to the South Seas,
then to America, traversing it from South to North, until we reach
the Eskimos, and finally to Africa. Within the smaller, geographical
areas we will often observe progress in melodic formation. Yet it is
impossible to create a single, unambiguous series out of the collected
musical achievements of humanity, for progress has taken many different
directions. Conversely, we will discover more and more connections between
geographically neighboring or ethnologically related peoples, and thereby
gain a broad, coherent picture of musical practice. [<i>AM,</i> 107]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While organized as such for a popular audience, this "musical journey
around the world" inadvertently demonstrates the archival aporia in
representations of music's evolution (<i>AM,</i> 196). The archive
embodies the dream of objectivity, which, by virtue of the multiplicity
of sounds that it contains, resists any attempt to construct a single
narrative of progress. Therefore, although Stumpf's theory of origins
is predicated on the notion of lineal development, his phonogram
demonstrations are organized geographically, illustrating that musical
"progress" follows many and sometimes divergent paths. To plot these
trajectories did not necessarily mean to construct a linear model of
evolution (such as that posited by E. B. Tylor); in fact, evolutionary
thought assumed various forms.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
  Stumpf's lecture thus made no claims to linearity, continuity, or
  completeness, even as it continued to emphasize evolution.

<p>
In the course of their own professional development, Hornbostel and
his younger colleagues would focus less on origins and more on the
cultural connections among seemingly dissonant musical forms. Rather than
drawing schematic connections as direct lines or developmental series,
they preferred elliptical and discontinuous forms such as parallels
and circles.
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
  In their 1903 address to the Berlin Society for Anthropology, for
  example, Abraham and Hornbostel suggested that "If we may conceive
  of exotic music as primitive, thus situating it parallel to earlier
  developmental stages of European music, it would provide us with clues
  as to how music actually sounded in antiquity" ("BPM," 225). This
  Eurocentric proposal was based on a blatant, temporal fallacy,
  one that fundamentally confused morphology with history. Stumpf too
  would commit this fallacy in <i>The Origins of Music</i>, conflating
  the appearance of formal simplicity in "primitive songs" with the
  chronological beginnings of music itself. Evolutionary thinking
  made this idea compelling, allowing comparative musicologists not
  only to work backwards and forwards in time, and thereby generate
  developmental series, but also to move "diagonally" through space,
  in order to draw cultural parallels or analogies. The temporal
  fallacy was therefore based on the notion of the primitive, but not
  restricted to it. Phonography, in fact, established an object that
  could be imagined as occupying any number of intermediate stages on
  an evolutionary timeline, positioned at select intervals between
  the origins of music and its "modern" manifestations. Abraham and
  Hornbostel thus located "exotic music" not as a point of origin, but
  "parallel to earlier stages of European music."

<p>
Here they were referring to their own "Studies on the Tone System and
Music of the Japanese," based on Berlin recordings of Kawakami Otijoro's
musical theater troupe starring Sada Yakko. While recognizing that this
troupe was an icon of Japanese modernity,

<b></b>

Abraham and Hornbostel interpreted its music in terms of Westernization,
deploring the Japanese government's efforts to import songs, instruments,
and orchestrations from Europe and the United States.
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
  Here, again, they understood the price of modernization to be the loss
  of "charming originality," which the phonograph would nevertheless
  allow them to isolate, extract, and preserve for analysis ("TMJ,"
  67). More specifically, as a result of their studies, Abraham and
  Hornbostel identified "pure tuning [<i>reine Stimmung</i>] as the
  essential basis of contemporary Japanese music" ("TMJ," 33-4). This
  term referred back to Pythagorean intonation, a tuning of the scale
  in which all fourths and fifths are "pure" (untempered), thus making
  thirds sound out of tune to the modern ear. In locating a Pythagorean
  "root" of modern Japanese music, Abraham and Hornbostel felt permitted
  to posit a historical link to ancient Greek melody. This link, in turn,
  provided a basis for comparison by analogy: "It is safe to assume
  the common derivation of modern Europe's harmonic music and modern
  Japan's non-harmonic music; they are late fruits from the same tree"
  ("TMJ," 34-5). As Hornbostel would aver, now with conviction, "Exotic
  music offers astounding analogies to earlier forms of our own music,
  which we know only through a tradition that has gaping holes in it. We
  gain a better idea of how ancient Greek music must have sounded by
  listening to, say, Japanese musicians, than by reading the works of
  Classical authors" ("EM," 93).

<p>
At the turn of the century, the phonograph seemed uniquely equipped to
make evolution audible. The evolution of music would be heard not by
reading old manuscripts, but by listening to contemporary recordings
of exotic melodies. To listen in this way was to travel not simply
across generations, as Edison had imagined the use of his device, but
across the greater expanse of history and geography. In its function as
a scientific instrument, the phonograph established a tangible body of
music that could be dissected, like the re of the Hottentot Venus,
and reconstructed in a variety of forms. It shaped and reshaped the
discourse of comparative musicology, informing a succession of scientific
narratives. In this context, phonography came to serve at once as a
representational strategy for constructing the evolution of music,
and a system for traversing it. Just as the discipline of comparative
musicology would take shape by recasting the terms of evolution, its
prime instrument would render newly material evolution's sound.

"PM," 57; italics in original. Alexander Rehding has recently traced the
search for origins in German musicology around 1900 through the context
of the philosophy of origins (<i>Ursprungsphilosophie</i>). He argues
that origins should be understood not as a chronological category, but
rather as an "ontological" one, from which the temporal aspect has been
evacuated (<i>pace</i> Martin Heidegger). Yet these categories were never
so neatly separated as Rehding would seem to suggest. A wholly appropriate
emphasis on essentialism and ontology cannot adequately account for the
empirical methods and evolutionary theories of comparative musicologists
in particular. Nor can it explain the crucial role that a temporal medium
like the phonograph played as a scientific instrument for the study of
non-European music. At the turn of the century, comparative musicology
co-opted the search for origins in the context of scientific positivism,
and transformed it with the tools of modernity. This transformation can
only be seen if we veer from the center of academic musicology and explore
its periphery&#8212;that is, the discursive contexts in which non-Western
music circulated around 1900. These contexts frame comparative musicology
as a historical project that I understand as an attempt to render
evolution audible. See Alexander Rehding, "The Quest for the Origins of
Music in Germany Circa 1900," <i>Journal of the American Musicological
Society</i> 53, no. 2 : 345-85; hereafter abbreviated as "QO."

While film historians have recently begun to analyze the dynamic
interaction of anthropology and early cinema, they have thus far
paid relatively little attention to ethnomusicology and early sound
technology. (That project has been undertaken, I hasten to add, by
scholars of folklore and ethnomusicology, though mainly in a conventional
mode of disciplinary history.) Facile distinctions between the visual and
the acoustic do not suffice to explain this disparity in film studies,
especially in light of recent attempts to reconceptualize the history of
early cinema in terms of sound technology. Ironically, when seen against
the backdrop of Anglo-American anthropology and its vexed relationship
to the moving image, the case of German comparative musicology appears
extremely compelling. There are at least three reasons for this: First,
comparative musicologists held recording technology to be a necessary
condition for the possibility of conducting their research. Second,
this technology was crucial to the rise of comparative musicology as
an institution, evinced by the Berlin School and its phonogram archive,
which I will discuss in detail. Third, comparative musicologists commonly
affirmed the epistemological status of the phonographic record as
"acoustic evidence." Each of these points suggests that, in contrast to
early cinema's peripheral (if fascinating) relationship to anthropology,
the phonograph occupied a central position in comparative musicology. Even
while engaging the connections between Anglo-American anthropology and
the moving image, Alison Griffiths' important

cognition, ethnology, transcription, and analysis; it also encompassed
the study of musical instruments (organology). For a concise overview of

This analogy is intended to suggest neither that the audible and
the visible were interchangeable, nor that their institutions were
disconnected from one another. In fact, the sound archive needs to be
located adjacent to the museum, the cinema, and even the department
store, for each of these institutions shaped the practical as well as
the imaginary work of comparative musicologists.

"BP," 83. In another context, Thomas Richards has argued that "the
imperial archive was a fantasy of knowledge collected and united in
the service of state and empire." Indeed, Stumpf envisaged the Berlin
Phonogram Archive as uniting disparate imperial agents and activities:
"The new empire is proud of its colonies and does everything in its
power to exploit them materially. It is our duty to combine that with
scientific exploitation, i.e. with research on the nature and the
indigenous culture of the new territories. Other colonial empires
have not neglected this <i>nobile officium</i>. We too have made an
excellent start, but wherever the culture of indigenous peoples is to be
described exactly, comprehensively, and scientifically in scholarly works,
phonographic records should not be lacking. And what then? Should they
be squandered and destroyed? No, they must of course be collected and
stored. Such an institution is a necessary corollary of our colonial
aspirations in the highest sense." Thomas Richards, <i>The Imperial
Archive: Knowledge and the Fantasy of Empire</i> (London: Verso, 1993),
6; hereafter abbreviated as <i>IA</i>; "BP," 83-4. On the imbrication of
technology and empire, see Daniel R. Headrick, <i>The Tools of Empire:
Technology and European Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century</i>

The comparative method and its rich tradition in the German sciences
surely help explain why Stumpf and his assistants conducted their research
in Berlin, whereas their American colleagues more often recorded music "on
location" (e.g., at Indian pueblos). At the same time, I would suggest,
the proliferation of ethnographic entertainments in Berlin represents
another (mass-cultural) context in which this preference for comparison
should be understood. On the comparative method, see Philip V. Bohlman,
"Traditional Music and Cultural Identity: Persistent Paradigm in the
History of Ethnomusicology," <i>Yearbook for Traditional Music</i> 20
: 26-42.

Carl Stumpf, "Musikpsychologie in England: Betrachtungen &uuml;ber
Herleitung der Musik aus der Sprache und aus dem thierischen
Entwicklungsproce&szlig;, &uuml;ber Empirismus und Nativismus in der
Musiktheorie," <i>Vierteljahrsschrift f&uuml;r Musikwissenschaft</i>
1 : 261-349; hereafter abbreviated as "ME." Alexander J. Ellis'
pioneering study from the same year, "On the Musical Scales of Various
Nations," is generally acknowledged as the starting point of comparative
musicology because of its exemplary empirical method (tonometric analysis)
and its influential assumption that many non-Western scales exhibit
equal temperament. Stumpf made this study accessible to German-speaking
scientists by publishing a review of it in <i>Vierteljahrsschrift f&uuml;r
Musikwissenschaft</i> 2 : 511-24. But it was his earlier survey
of "Music Psychology in England" that helped establish evolutionism as
a theoretical framework for ethnomusicology. Here it is worth noting
that Georg Simmel had already offered his own theory of the origins of
music based on a critique of Darwin. Simmel's study is also prescient in
that it combines psychological and ethnological approaches, anticipating
the interdisciplinary strategy of comparative musicology. If Stumpf was
aware of Simmel's precedent, he did not refer to it. See Georg Simmel,
"Psychologische und ethnologische Studien &uuml;ber Musik," <i>Zeitschrift
f&uuml;r V&ouml;lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft</i> 13 :

In 1909, Stumpf distilled the major elements from this critique and
recast them in a popular idiom for a series of public lectures on "The
Origins of Music," an abridged version of which was first published
in <i>Internationale Wochenschrift f&uuml;r Wissenschaft, Kunst und
Technik</i> 3, no. 51 (18 December 1909): 1593-616; the lectures were
later reprinted in full as a monograph. I here quote this latter source

Working in the tradition of Hermann von Helmholtz, Stumpf understood
human perception to be embodied, and therefore subject to measurement
and control, but also deeply subjective and contingent. He was
particularly fascinated with the organization of psychology around
sound, with the ways in which sound is saturated with psychological
data. His 1883 monograph <i>Tonpsychologie</i> traces the impact of
sound waves on psychological functions in terms of aural perception,
judgment, and attention. On psychology and its relationship to early
ethnomusicology, see Carl Stumpf and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel,

In 1886, Stumpf received further confirmation of his transcription
from the young Franz Boas, who attended the same troupe's performance
in Berlin, transcribed two of their songs by hand, and published his
own linguistic studies of the Bella Coola. In 1893, Boas made the first
field recordings of Kwakiutl Indians&#8212;recordings that he would later
deposit at the Berlin Phonogram Archive. Boas became, of course, the
preeminent scholar of Northwest Coast Indians and one of the founders of
cultural anthropology in the United States. See "LBI," 408-9; Ira Jacknis,

"LBI," 426. Stumpf and his assistants would employ such terms as "wild"
and "uncivilized" in a self-conscious, strategic manner. Sometimes they
offset the word "primitive" in quotation marks so as to restrict the
range of its meaning. More often they used the (no less problematic)
term "exotic" in order to describe non-Europeans as well as their
musical productions (as in <i>exotische Melodien</i>). In so doing,
comparative musicologists were not quibbling over terminology, but making
an argument about

<b></b>

the legitimacy of their emergent discipline. Their use of "exotic" was
meant to counter the received idea that non-European music was "primitive"
(a term which had recently taken on such pejorative connotations as
"childlike" and "backward"), while stressing the complexity and confirming
the alterity of their object of study. They likewise retained the term
"natural peoples," but inflected it to denote non-Western peoples in
a historical sense. See, for example, Hornbostel's dictionary entry on
the "Musik der Naturv&ouml;lker," in the annual supplement to vol. 24

In fact, comparative musicologists acknowledged that "cultural lands"
(<i>Kulturl&auml;nder</i>) such as India, China, and the Middle East
had their own musical documents (e.g., histories, theories, notation
systems) and experts (such as the Indian scholar S. M. Tagore). Yet
even as Hornbostel and his colleagues consulted some of these sources,
they reaffirmed the priority of phonographic recordings by stressing
the methodological difference between a "philological-literary study"
and a "musical study," such as their own, based on sound recordings. This
emphasis on recording was clearly announced by a series of articles, each
of which was titled "Phonographed [non-Western] Melodies." See, e.g.,

Melodien" , trans. Bonnie Wade, in vol. 1 of <i>Hornbostel Opera

This "medical" mode of perception emerged in comparative musicology
against the backdrop of physical anthropology, which was a medical
science in nineteenth-century Germany. The founder of that discipline,
Rudolf Virchow, was an ardent opponent of evolutionism, as mentioned
earlier. If Abraham and Hornbostel (the one a practicing physician,
the other a trained natural scientist) took their perceptual model from
medical science, they transformed it not only for music, but also for an
evolutionist paradigm of comparative musicology. For more on Virchow and
medical science, see <i>PSC,</i> 51-5; Benoit Massin, "From Virchow to
Fischer: Physical Anthropology and 'Modern Race Theories' in Wilhelmine
Germany," in Stocking, ed., <i>Volksgeist as Method</i>, 79-154. For a

For this reason (among others), it is important not to assign too much
power to recording technologies like the phonograph. See on this point

Darwin was keenly aware of the problems that vision and narrative posed

has recently explored such problems in the context of evolutionary
museums. "Evolution and the Politics of Vision" (paper presented at

<p>
<a name="FOOT77" href="#REF77">77</a>.
The key context here was, of course, the "theory of cultural circles"
(or <i>Kulturkreislehre</i>). At a 1904 meeting of the Berlin Society
for Anthropology, the young museum curators Fritz Graebner and Bernhard
Ankermann publicly challenged the discipline's elder statesmen, Bastian
and Virchow, by advocating a "culture-historical method" based no longer
on the "universal" foundations of humanity, but on particular differences
between cultures. The so-called theory of cultural circles aimed to chart
the "diffusion" of particular "cultural traits" as people migrated across
the globe and intermixed with

<b></b>

other groups of people. It also allowed curators such as Graebner
and Ankermann to introduce evolutionary narratives into German
museum exhibits. Woodruff D. Smith has analyzed this shift in
German anthropology as "the diffusionist revolt" (see <i>PSC</i>,
140-61). I would argue that comparative musicologists also heralded
this scientific revolution, while attempting to ride into the
university on the coattails of anthropology. See Albrecht Schneider,
<i>Musikwissenschaft und Kulturkreislehre: Zur Methodik und Geschichte der
vergleichenden Musikwissenschaft</i> (Bonn: Verlag f&uuml;r systematische
Musikwissenschaft, 1976); for a brief summary in English, see "GA," 88-91.

If the attempt to disentangle itself from the museum was characteristic
of much experimental art in the 1910s and 1920s, and again in the
1960s and 1970s, then we might describe our present historical moment
in terms of the attempt by the museum, as it approaches the condition
of the multiplex entertainment center, to disentangle itself from the
project of experimental art altogether. This is not simply a matter
of what goes around comes around. Nor does it have to do with the ways
in which museums are increasingly devoting more and more space to the
arts of shopping, dining, web surfing, tourism, and so forth. Rather,
it is driven by the fact that museums have oversold the notion, as Brian
O'Doherty once put it, of the assimilation of art without effort.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  A major force in the promulgation of this notion, particularly
  with respect to the organization of exhibitions, is the dramatic
  reconration of curatorial practice that has taken place over
  the last several decades. Where once it was primarily curators who
  called the shots&#8212;on account of their subject expertise and
  disciplinary judgment&#8212;these professionals now routinely serve on
  box office-driven curatorial teams composed of marketing specialists,
  public relations personnel, education curators, exhibition evaluators,
  and project "managers." The attempt to embrace the differing and
  often directly competing priorities represented by each team player
  often leads to a leveling of critical ambition; perhaps nowhere has
  this leveling proved more detrimental than in the exhibition of new
  and difficult art.

<p>
With this problem in mind, I would like to turn to consider an earlier
moment in the history of the acquisition and exhibition of contemporary
art, wherein an alternative model of curatorial

<b></b>

practice was advanced, and to a considerable extent realized&#8212;in
Russia, in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. Involving as
it does the interventions of artists such as Kazimir Malevich, Vasily
Kandinsky, Varvara Stepanova, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Vladimir Tatlin,
and David Shterenberg, and critics like Osip Brik and Nikolai Punin,
this alternative model gives the lie to the standard assumption that
Russian vanguard artists and critics&#8212;in their pursuit of the
dissolution of the division of art and life&#8212;simply turned their
backs on the museum. On the contrary. The former Suprematist painter
Malevich, for example, was among the many vanguard voices calling
in 1919 for the state's construction of a vast network of museums
of contemporary art across the new Republic. This network was to be
interconnected by a "superhighway" (<i>magistral'</i>) for the smooth
circulation of traveling exhibitions, and anchored by a central museum
in the new capital, Moscow.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Like the electrical engineer Gleb Krzhizhanovskii's adventurous
  contemporaneous plan for state electrification, Malevich's proposal
  followed the structural principle&#8212;the arterial linking of
  city to countryside&#8212;of most utopian visions formulated under
  the Bolshevik government's Civil War-period (1918-1920) policy of
  War Communism. This policy comprised a highly centralized command
  economy&#8212;or, at least, fantasy of a command economy, if we are
  to share Tim Clark's wise skepticism
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 &#8212;with a putatively totalizing control over the Republic's even
 most far-flung reaches.

<p>
As it was to turn out, the vanguard project for the state
"museumification" (<i>muzeefikatsiia</i>) of contemporary art was both
undertaken and substantially realized by the new cultural bureaucracy
established in January 1918, the People's Commissariat of Education
and Enlightenment, or, as it is usually known (by its Russian acronym),
Narkompros. In March 1920, the first of Narkompros's new contemporary
art museums opened as the Museum of Painterly Culture (Muzei Zhivopisnoi
Kul'tury [MZhK]), in a suite of eight galleries on Volkhonka in downtown
Moscow.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Its definitive installation took place in June 1920.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  According to a Narkompros guidebook, some thirty such museums were
  founded by 1921, with a centralized Museum Bureau in Moscow functioning
  as an acquisition and distribution center for the shipment of work
  to Petrograd and provincial cities.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
With the Bolsheviks' nationalization of private property in 1918 and
the abolition of the private dealer system&#8212;a system that the
expressionist painter Kandinsky criticized as "more or less accidental,
capricious, and arbitrary,"
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  and that the constructivist Rodchenko condemned as oppressive and
  coercive ("The patrons have oppressed us, have forced us to carry
  out their whims")
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 &#8212;the Moscow Bureau became the new Republic's sole patron of
 contemporary art. In his official capacity as head of that Bureau,
 Rodchenko reports in June 1921 that "for the past three years the best
 contemporary artists, both in Moscow and the provinces, have lived
 exclusively from the sale of their work to the Bureau, and the Bureau
 has supplied the provinces generously with contemporary art." Chiefly
 through a process of studio visits, the Bureau had acquired the
 work of over four hundred artists who would otherwise have been left
 stranded by the dismantling of the market economy. Such state support
 for contemporary art, Rodchenko continues, "is unprecedented anywhere
 in the world," and,

<b></b>

as such, "is an achievement of which the <i>commune</i> ought to be
proud."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  With the 26 million rubles spent on contemporary art between 1918
  and 1921, the state purchased some 1,336 paintings, 404 drawings,
  121 graphic works, 54 sculptures, and 11 spatial constructions.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  About a hundred of these acquisitions were selected for display in
  the Moscow MZhK, while the rest were earmarked for redistribution
  across the Republic.

<p>
Until recently, the new Russian contemporary art museums were rather
little known or studied beyond&#8212;or even by&#8212;specialists in
the field.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  It is thus worth underscoring the fact that they preceded by a decade,
  and in part encouraged, the foundation of the Museum of Modern Art
  (MoMA) in New York, which is often cited as the ur-example of the
  genre. With a single exception, the Russian museums represent
  the very earliest instantiation of a phenomenon that has since
  rapidly proliferated in many parts of the world, particularly in the
  postwar period and especially since the 1980s. At the time of their
  foundation during the Civil War, however, their single precedent
  was the Mus&eacute;e du Luxembourg in Paris, which, in 1818, had
  been transformed by government decree into an institution devoted
  exclusively to the work of "living artists," and thereby differentiated
  in function from the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, the so-called galleries
  of the dead.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  While calls had been made as early as 1912 for a Russian "museum of
  living artists"
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
&#8212;as the Luxembourg was nicknamed&#8212;the notion of a network of
such museums fed by a centralized Bureau handling all acquisition and
distribution, with its underlying principle of centrifugal circulation,
was at the time entirely unprecedented. (Though its basic principle was
soon popularized elsewhere: In 1931, for example, A. Conger Goodyear
asserts that MoMA&#8212;of which he was first president&#8212;"should
be a feeder, primarily to the Metropolitan Museum, but also to museums
generally throughout the country."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  A comparable principle structures Andr&eacute; Malraux's mid-century
  proposal in France for a nation-wide network of cultural centers,
  the <i>maisons de la culture</i>, while the late twentieth century
  witnesses the Guggenheim's global expansion out of New York, and the
  national spiraling of the "new Tates" out of London.)

<p>
Unique to the Russian case, however, is the fact that its Republic-wide
network of museums of contemporary art was proposed, established,
organized, and administered by artists themselves (in concert with a
number of critics), rather than museum professionals. For the division
of Narkompros responsible for overseeing the museum project&#8212;the
Department of Fine Arts, IZO (hence: IZO Narkompros)&#8212;was staffed
predominantly by artists, the majority of whom were leftists and otherwise
known as Futurists. This alliance between state and vanguard had had to
be fought for. Honoring art's new-found autonomy from Tsarist regulation
and censorship, the Futurists had initially refused to collaborate with
the Bolsheviks in the reinstitutionalization of Russian culture. Within
months, however, a realpolitik concerning the control of the Republic's
newly expropriated cultural heritage emerged amidst their ranks. By
mid-1918, Futurists had joined in droves the state's official if still
fledgling cultural bureaucracy.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
My subject is thus the emergence between 1918 and 1921 of a theory and
practice of what might be called Futurist museology. Before turning to
unpack this at first glance somewhat oxymoronic phenomenon&#8212;with
its simultaneous movement forward into the future and backward into the
past&#8212;the meaning of the terms <i>leftist</i> and <i>Futurist</i>

<b></b>

in the present context should be clarified. While sharing the Italian
Futurists' vitality and iconoclasm, the Russian Futurists were a
more diffuse lot, comprising not only the various groups of Futurist
poets and Cubo-Futurist painters that formed around 1912, but also most
experimental practitioners working in the visual and literary arts in the
1910s and 1920s. Generally speaking, Futurist was used wherever we would
tend to say avant-garde, the latter expression being significantly less
common in Russia at the time. After 1917, and no doubt in part because
of the key role of the Futurists in IZO Narkompros, the term Futurist
came to be used more or less interchangeably with leftist&#8212;in
opposition to centrist and rightist. None of these terms necessarily
inferred any particular party political affiliation&#8212;though they
could and sometimes did (as in the case of the critic Brik, who was a
member of the RKP[b])&#8212;but rather referred chiefly to the perceived
radicality, or lack thereof, of one's mode of production.

<p>
The appellation <i>Futurist</i> was more than merely nominal, however. If
one had to say what made certain strands of Russian culture both before
and after 1917 Futurist, it was their shared and unyielding commitment
to, and absolute privileging of, the notion of formal or technological
invention in the arts and the sciences alike. A broadsheet manifesto
issued by the poet Velimir Khlebnikov and his merry entourage in 1916
textualizes this commitment in a sententious formulation that became,
over the course of the next decade or so, something of an all-purpose
Futurist battle cry. Announcing the operative terms of a "new holy war"
against "that fat caterpillar, the freight train of elders," Khlebnikov
trumpets: "LET THE MILKY WAY BE DIVIDED INTO THE MILKY WAY OF THE
INVENTORS [<i>IZOBRETATELEI</i>] AND THE MILKY WAY OF THE CONSUMERS
[<i>PRIOBRETATELEI</i>]."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The term <i>priobretatel'</i>&#8212;consumer or acquisitor&#8212;was
  rather new in Russian, and the poet's usage of it utterly
  pejorative. In the context of the broadsheet, Khlebnikov's call for the
  division of our galaxy into a vanguard who invent, discover, pioneer,
  and produce culture, on the one hand, and a rearguard who acquire,
  amass, possess, own, and consume it, on the other, was a key part of an
  ingenious repackaging operation undertaken by a small group of Futurist
  poets led by Nikolai Aseev, who remodeled themselves as Martians
  after those in H. G. Wells's novel, <i>The War of the Worlds</i>.

<p>
But Khlebnikov's putative antinomy of invention and consumption was
to have a much longer shelf life than the poet himself might have
countenanced, given his Futurist commitment to a vastly accelerated
temporality. Numerous iterations of it are found in vanguard texts
published after the Revolution. It serves to frame, for example, the
project of <i>Iskusstvo kommuny</i> (Art of the commune), the state-funded
weekly newspaper published by the IZO Futurists between 1918 and 1919 that
quickly became the staple reading matter of all cultural leftists. In its
third issue, the critic Punin&#8212;a major player in the vanguard museum
project in general, and in the organization and administration of the
Petrograd museum in particular, as Jennifer Cahn has recently demonstrated
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 &#8212;invokes Khlebnikov's galactic division as an explanatory gloss
 on the current division of contemporary artists into left and right.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  In <i>Iskusstvo kommuny</i>'s nineteenth (and final) issue, the IZO
  Futurists march Khlebnikov's battle cry across the breadth of the
  front page, directly under the masthead&#8212;a parting shot

<b></b>

at their comrades higher up the Narkompros food chain, who had just
ordered the newspaper's closure on account of its unrelenting attacks
on Russia's cultural heritage.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
A few years later, the Futurist poet Sergei Tret'iakov turned multitasker
in the 1920s returns to Khlebnikov's antinomy in his attempt to define,
historicize, and futurize Russian Futurism's first decade of production in
the inaugural issue of the constructivist journal <i>Lef: Zhurnal levogo
fronta iskusstv</i> (Lef: journal of the left front of the arts) (March
1923): "'The creators are set apart from the consumers' (Khlebnikov)."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  A few years later again, in an extraordinary eulogy written in the
  wake of Vladimir Mayakovsky's suicide in 1930, the linguist and
  Futurist proselytizer Roman Jakobson conjoins Khlebnikov's binary
  with speculative philosophy's antinomy of "I" and "not-I." He thus
  reads Mayakovsky's hostility to the "stagnating slime"&#8212;the
  accumulated conventions and habitual rhythms of "everyday life"
  (<i>byt</i>)&#8212;which "stifles life [<i>zhizn'</i>] in its tight,
  hard mold": "Th[e] terrible 'double' of the poet is his conventional
  and commonplace 'self,' the purchaser and owner whom Khlebnikov once
  contrasted with the inventor and discoverer."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  For Khlebnikovian Futurism, as for the contiguously formulated
  Shklovskian project of defamiliarization, the mundane, repetitive
  world of <i>byt</i> was everything that the vanguard discourse of
  <i>zhizn'</i>&#8212;"life" as defined within the elevated realm of
  philosophical and aesthetic speculation&#8212;sought to repress.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
I dwell on Khlebnikov's holy-war cry and its successive iterations in
order to pose the problem&#8212;even the paradox&#8212;that lies at the
heart of Futurist museology. It goes without saying that the Futurists'
march against the <i>priobretatel'</i> was driven by their longstanding
hostility&#8212;fully endorsed by October&#8212;to the increasing role of
the marketplace in cultural life and the inevitable imbrication of their
practice within the economic structures of capitalism, an economy that
had accelerated rapidly in the late nineteenth century and to which the
avant-garde had been indebted for its survival (precisely the kind of
structural dependency which Clement Greenberg famously described as an
"umbilical cord of gold"). Against all evidence to the contrary, the
utopian Futurists posited the inventor as exempt from capital. But the
Futurists' march against the <i>priobretatel'</i> was driven also and,
in the present context, more significantly, by their campaign against
the past and the suffocating burden of tradition. Khlebnikov's antinomy
reiterates the raw terms of this campaign as it had been originally
set forth in 1912, in the now famous inaugural manifesto of Russian
Futurism: the right of poets to "feel an insurmountable hatred for the
language existing before their time," to "throw Pushkin, Dostoevsky,
[and] Tolstoy . . . overboard from the Ship of Modernity."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
One is prompted to ask, therefore, what is the antipass&eacute;ist doing
in the museology business? What is the significance of the fact that
the inventor him- or herself now becomes a <i>priobretatel'</i>, in the
sense of an acquisitor or collector of a fast-becoming-past present? What
does it mean when, despite all Rodchenko's protestations to the contrary
("We will not give in to . . . the intelligentsia that has taken the
place of the former bureaucrats"),
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  the Khlebnikovian Futurist became precisely that, a bureaucrat? In
  what ways did such inversions, reversals, and transformations inflect
  the Futurists' negotiation of the museum question? Was the project
  of Futurist museology

<b></b>

ultimately a contradiction in terms? And what happened to the concept
of history in the landscape of museological revolution? A preliminary
sketch of the historical and institutional context in which Futurist
museology developed will help to ground these and related questions.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Petrograd Conference
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
For both diplomatic and domestic reasons, museological policy was a highly
sensitive matter for the Bolshevik government, still vulnerable in the
first year of its administration. Rumors had circulated abroad&#8212;as
reported by the critic Felix F&eacute;n&eacute;on, for example&#8212;that
Anatoly Lunacharsky (the first Commissar of Narkompros) would not
intervene to prevent the muzhiks "from cutting boots out of the Rembrandts
in the Hermitage."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  Along with the destruction of imperial monuments during October,
  and the state seizure of private collections in its aftermath, such
  rumors had done little to convince skeptical European nations of the
  new government's credibility. Since everything had to be done to hasten
  diplomatic recognition of its legitimacy, the Bolshevik leadership was
  obliged to take immediate steps to secure Russia's cultural heritage.

<p>
To this end, Lunacharsky established within Narkompros two separate
departments for cultural affairs. The first was the aforementioned IZO,
the responsibilities of which included the foundation of open-entrance
art schools (after the abolition of the quota-bound imperial academy),
the inauguration of an exhibitions program, and the organization of a
division for publication on the arts. In Petrograd, the key positions
in IZO's Collegium were held by leftists such as the modernist painter
Shterenberg (who served as director), the artist Natan Altman, and the
critics Punin and Brik. A parallel Collegium was established in Moscow
by Shterenberg's deputy, Tatlin, who invited on board radicals like
Malevich and the nonobjective painter Ol'ga Rozanova, as well as more
moderate res such as Kandinsky.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  The second body within Narkompros was the Department of Museums and
  the Preservation of Cultural Monuments, to which Lunacharsky granted
  exclusive jurisdiction over the reorganization and administration of
  the Republic's cultural patrimony. Unlike that of IZO, its Collegium
  was dominated by conservative artists and museum professionals.

<p>
In February 1919, IZO decided to challenge the Museums Department's
jurisdiction, particularly with respect to contemporary art. It convened
a week-long conference on the "museum question" in the Palace of Arts
(formerly the Winter Palace) in Petrograd, to which it invited artists,
art historians, museum directors, curators, and conservators. Among the
members of the Museums Department's Collegium who traveled from Moscow
were Pavel Muratov, an art historian, and Igor Grabar, an impressionist
painter, art historian, and director of the Tretiakov Gallery since
1913&#8212;both conservative res much maligned within Futurist
circles. IZO's purpose in convening the conference can be gleaned from
its "Declaration," which was read to the assembled delegates by Punin
and circulated at the conference as a broadsheet, later appearing on
the front page of <i>Iskusstvo kommuny</i> in one of two special issues
devoted to the proceedings.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  Its key premises were also further reinforced by conference

<b></b>

papers by Punin, Brik, the neoprimitivist painter Aleksei Grishchenko,
and the graphic designer and ceramicist, Sergei Chekhonin.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
IZO's "Declaration" made three main demands:<br />
First, that the Russian state should henceforth entrust artists
rather than scholars and museum professionals with the acquisition
of contemporary art: "The business of the acquisition of works of
contemporary art is exclusively the province of artists. . . . As the
only ones competent in questions of contemporary art, and as the force
which creates artistic value, [it is] artists alone [who] are able to
carry out acquisitions."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  While IZO's first demand&#8212;with its insistence that artists
  should or even could maintain control over the evaluation of their
  practice&#8212;sought to strip existing museum directors and curators
  of their purchasing powers, its second endeavored to force them to
  relinquish their individual fiefdoms: IZO proposed the centralization
  in a single state reserve (Gosfond) of all existing museum collections
  (including, for example, the former Shchukin and Morozov collections of
  modern French painting in Moscow), as well as all new acquisitions. It
  would then be IZO staffers who would have the exclusive right to
  select from Gosfond works of art to supply&#8212;and this is the
  declaration's third demand&#8212;a network of "Museums of Artistic
  Culture" (<i>Muzei Khudozhestvennoi Kul'tury</i>).
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  The idea was that these museums would then be replenished on a more
  or less continuous basis by the latest selections from the central
  reserve.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  As one conference participant put it, "such . . . museum[s] will
  prove to be . . . living organism[s], pulsating together with the
  pulsations of artistic life."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
IZO proposed a single criterion for the selection of work for the new
museums, namely, whether or not a given work manifested "artistic culture"
(<i>khudozhestvennaia kul'tura</i>).
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  In a separate position statement in the same issue of <i>Iskusstvo
  kommuny</i>, IZO defined this concept in terms of labor and invention:
  "The concept of 'artistic culture' contains within it&#8212;in
  accordance with the very meaning of the word 'culture' as <i>active
  work</i>&#8212;a creative moment; creativity presupposes the creation
  of something new, an invention; <i>artistic culture is [thus] nothing
  other than the culture of artistic invention</i>."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
With their redefinition of culture as invention, the IZO Futurists
promulgated formal, stylistic, or technical innovation as the exclusive
criterion of aesthetic value, thereby situating their museological project
firmly within the camp of Khlebnikov's vanguard of inventors. A "Museum
of Artistic Culture" would be, accordingly, a museum devoted to (the
history of) artistic invention. Layered over IZO's Futurism was also a new
concern, however, to redefine culture in terms of labor. In the aftermath
of October, the Futurists drew upon the revolutionary rhetoric of the
dissolution of the division of labor in order to promote the artist's
accession to the realm of the so-called practical worker, as opposed to
parasitical <i>intelligent</i>. IZO sought to de- or remythologize the
Khlebnikovian model, rebuffing the class position of intelligentsia with
which the Futurists, notwithstanding their own protests, were typically
associated. By setting forth a history of artistic invention as a history
of "'culture' as active work," the new museums were to document what
Lunacharsky describes as the "evolution of labor in the field of art."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
How did IZO's demands fare at the conference?<br />
More tolerant of the Futurists than any other Bolshevik leader of the
period, Lunacharsky endeavored to play the role of mediator between
the museum workers and their IZO antagonists by making concessions to
both sides. On the one hand, he agrees that in the past scholars and art
historians had indeed exercised too much control over acquisitions, and
he thus endorses IZO's demands for the right of artists both to control
acquisitions of contemporary art and also to establish Museums of Artistic
Culture. On the other hand, he rejects without hesitation IZO's demand
that, in order to supply such museums, artists be granted the right to
rummage through existing collections or a centralized reserve.

<p>
The Commissar's objections to this last are twofold: Most fundamentally,
Lunacharsky rejects as too reductive IZO's definition of the history
of art in terms of a history of invention: its "professional and
technicizing formalism," he argues, neglects equally important questions
such as the role in art of "inspiration" and "imagination." It ignored
art's capacity to express "ideas," reflect "human culture," and provide
"humanity's autobiography." According to the Commissar, IZO's narrowly
professional history of art was incapable of realizing the enlightenment
function of all museums as it had been decreed at the Third Congress of
the Soviets in 1918: to educate a public broader than just specialists
(artists and connoisseurs) so as to facilitate the proletariat's access
to its newfound cultural wealth. "It must be remembered," he points out,
"that the Museum exists neither for scholars nor for artists, but first
and foremost for the people [<i>dlia naroda</i>]."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  In addition, Lunacharsky argues that if IZO's demand to select
  at its will were granted, a precedent would be established that
  could lead to tremendous instability (not to mention administrative
  nightmares)&#8212;with every changing of the guard, a new history of
  art would have to be written.

<p>
Lunacharsky's response to IZO's demands guided two major resolutions
passed by the Petrograd conference. First, the desirability
of establishing a Museum of Artistic Culture was unanimously
ratified&#8212;although, significantly for our purposes, "without
resolving the question of the form of its organization." Second, it was
agreed that "a united state reserve must be decreed, in principle," but
with the proviso that "each individual collection may defend its right
to inviolability [<i>neprikosnovennost'</i>]" from forced centralization.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  The upshot was that the existing individual fiefdoms were to
  stay intact, which meant, in turn, that the proposed central
  reserve&#8212;and thus also the museums themselves&#8212;would
  have to be supplied entirely through new acquisitions. Thus, while
  these (qualified) ratifications represented significant gains for
  a developing Futurist museology, they nevertheless presented IZO
  Narkompros with new problems: What principles would guide the
  organization of the new Museum of Artistic Culture (and also,
  therefore, of the museum network overall)? What principles would
  shape its acquisitions policy?

<p>
In the following sections, I turn to consider the two most
important&#8212;and in the end antagonistic&#8212;theoretical models
advanced on the museum question in the wake of Petrograd: on the one
hand, that of Kandinsky, a vanguard painter who was, however, neither
a Khlebnikovian Futurist nor particularly committed to October, and,
on the other, that of Rodchenko, a Futurist <i>engag&eacute;</i>. Each
artist played a crucial role in the

<b></b>

initial organization and administration of the new museums: Kandinsky from
a position of considerable authority, Rodchenko as his insurgent young
comrade and eventual antagonist. While predominantly speculative in their
scope and ambition, each model was nevertheless formulated within and in
response to the concrete historical task of establishing and running the
very first of the new contemporary art museums&#8212;that in Moscow. In
the course of differentiating how each artist imagined this museum and,
by extension, the entire network of such museums, it will become evident
that the dialectical struggle between Kandinsky and Rodchenko that came
to dominate the Moscow avant-garde in the early 1920s&#8212;and that
led directly to the emergence of constructivism&#8212;was first played
out within the context of sustained museological experimentation.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Museum as a History of Composing
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Shortly after the Petrograd conference, Kandinsky was appointed founding
director of both the Moscow museum and the museum network overall,
as well as a key member of its Purchasing Commission. As such, his
responsibilities included overseeing acquisitions, distribution, and
the organization and administration of the museums themselves.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In this labor-intensive task, Kandinsky was assisted by a Museum
  Bureau, which carried out the onerous administrative work of
  registration and storage. In 1919, this Bureau was run by the Latvian
  painter Aleksandr Drevin, with the assistance of his compatriot Karl
  Ioganson as its "technical specialist," and from February 1920 onwards
  by Rodchenko.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  As mentioned at the outset, the Moscow museum opened in early
  1920, but not as a Museum of Artistic (<i>Khudozhestvennoi</i>)
  Culture&#8212;as IZO itself had initially proposed&#8212;but
  of Painterly (<i>Zhivopisnoi</i>) Culture. While the adjectives
  "artistic" and "painterly" were often used interchangeably, the
  former was much broader in its encompass, abrogating the traditional
  distinction between high and low, while the latter was restricted to
  the fine arts, and thereby reinstantiated it.

<p>
Given that Kandinsky was no Futurist <i>engag&eacute;</i>, his
appointment may perhaps seem somewhat surprising. Having spent most of
the preceding two decades in Germany, Kandinsky had returned to Moscow
after the outbreak of the First World War. In 1918, he accepted an
invitation to join the Moscow Collegium of IZO Narkompros, but without
committing himself to the politics of the new government. In retrospect,
it seems plausible to suggest that Kandinsky was appointed in 1919 as the
Bolsheviks' chief arbiter on the museum question not only on account of
his considerable international success and reputation abroad, but also
because his own formation as an artist had been largely removed from
the iconoclasm and internecine rivalries of the Russian avant-garde. In
other words, Kandinsky represented a voice of moderation that could be
entrusted with the difficult task of mediating the conflicting agendas of
radical leftists such as Malevich, on the one hand, and of conservative
artists cum museum professionals like Grabar, on the other.

<p>
In a long essay published in January 1920, Kandinsky discusses IZO's
museological agenda as it had been shaped under his direction over the
course of the year or so

<b></b>

since the Petrograd conference ("MZhK," 18-20; "MCP," 1:437-44). He
envisages the Moscow museum as setting forth the history of painting from
the mid-nineteenth century to the present, including not only Russian
but also French works, the latter drawn from the former Shchukin and
Morozov collections. By history Kandinsky does not mean chronicle. The
MZhK, he writes, will avoid a merely chronological account in which
the position of a work of art within the museum is a function of its
date. Such chronicling&#8212;or "historical sequencing" as he puts
it&#8212;is an utterly "chaotic" way in which to track art's development
over time. Unfortunately, however, it remains the most pervasive approach
to museum organization, both in Russia and abroad:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Museums divide art up into period after period, century after century,
regardless of whether one period has any relation to another, apart
from that of historical sequence. Thus the usual type of museum is
reminiscent of some chronicle that draws its thread from one event to
the next, without seeking to penetrate their inner meaning. Such art
historical museums have a definite value as a treasury of artistic
production. . . . [But] the evident deficiency of this kind of museum
is . . . its lack of any guiding principle or system. ["MZhK," 18;
"MCP," 1:437]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In faulting the presentation of historical sequence as lacking in guiding
principle or system, Kandinsky appears to be speaking to the positivist
dilution over the course of the nineteenth century of a famously
paradigmatic model of the modern museum&#8212;Karl Friedrich Schinkel's
Altes Museum (1823-1830) in Berlin. Controversial in its time, Schinkel's
design for the Altes Museum had overturned the then-prevailing academic
model for museum display, wherein a canon of great masterpieces of
painting and sculpture was assembled to provide exemplars for imitation,
irrespective of their particular place within a historical sequence. The
latter model, predicated upon a concept of normative beauty, had dominated
museum organization during a period when museums were directly connected
to the pedagogical functions of art academies. In the Altes Museum, by
contrast, Schinkel confined the academic model to a single space&#8212;a
rotunda filled with exemplary works of classical sculpture&#8212;while
designing all the remaining galleries in such a way as to accommodate
a chronological narrative of the history of art.

<p>
But this narrative was to be no merely positivist chronicle. As
Douglas Crimp has argued, Schinkel's design enshrined a new notion
of the museum that was indebted not only to the art historians on his
advisory committee, but also to his friend G. F. W. Hegel's lectures on
aesthetics (which the philosopher read in Berlin during the very years
of the museum's construction). The galleries of the Altes Museum were to
constitute the physical realization of the progressive and teleological
narrative of history itself; they were to "march" the visitor "through
the history of man's striving for Absolute Spirit."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  From Kandinsky's point of view, it was precisely such a guiding
  principle or system that the typical nineteenth-century art-historical
  museum lacked. (In fact, as Yve-Alain Bois has suggested, the narrative
  ordonnance of the Altes Museum did not become the dominant model for
  museum organization until the twentieth century.)
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  Kandinsky was not seeking a return to the academic model, but rather
  contrasting

<b></b>

two different models for historical construction: one, the merely
"chaotic, historical sequence," the other a Hegelian model in which the
"inner meaning" of art's historical development might be systematically
explicated.

<p>
What, then, would be the guiding principle of Kandinsky's Museum of
Painterly Culture? As discussed above, the IZO Futurists had redefined
aesthetic value in terms of formal invention,
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  thereby proclaiming their relative disinterest in the broader
  ideological or historical conditions informing artistic production. In
  accordance with IZO's position, Kandinsky proposes that the Moscow
  museum showcase the "invention . . . of new artistic devices
  [<i>priemov</i>]" and the "development of purely artistic forms,
  independent of their content."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  Like his colleagues, Kandinsky hypostatizes the technology of the work
  of art&#8212;the formal or technical aspects of its making&#8212;as
  the guiding principle for the construction of a new narrative of the
  history of art as a history of pure invention.

<p>
One of the main functions of Kandinsky's proposed organization of
the MZhK was to provide a history&#8212;in the sense of a historical
pedigree&#8212;that would authorize, as it were, the explicitly
formal preoccupations of contemporary art, such as the compositional
concerns of his own series of large-scale "Compositions" of abstract
or quasi-abstract forms that he had completed in Munich in 1913 to
great acclaim. From Kandinsky's point of view, the formal problems
of composition and relational balance constituted the main problems of
artistic production, and while their resolution was for him primarily the
means to an expressive end&#8212;the communication to the viewer of the
"state of his soul"&#8212;these problems nevertheless directly shaped
his ultimate objective for the MZhK, which was to foreground the history
of art as a history of "composing," as opposed to "transcribing."

<p>
As such, Kandinsky's new organizational model sought to dislodge from
center stage the darling of museum professionals in the early twentieth
century, namely, the mid-nineteenth-century Russian realist painter
Il'ya Repin. Kandinsky considered realism, which had arisen in Russia
in the 1860s in protest against the idealism with which the academic
doctrine of imitation had tempered mimetic illusionism, an aberration
within the history of art. The slavish imitation of appearances leads,
he asserted, to weak draughtsmanship and the neglect of composition.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  Kandinsky proposed, accordingly, a drastic reduction in the quantity
  of realist works to be included in the MZhK. In their place, he
  hoped to narrate the <i>longue dur&eacute;e</i> of composition,
  by presenting a teleological narrative of the history of painting
  which one could potentially imagine as culminating&#8212;not in a
  positivist sense but rather in terms of the realization of history's
  "guiding principle"&#8212;in the Munich Compositions.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Museum as Laboratory
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
By the time the MZhK finally opened in late March 1920, however, the
historicizing ambition of both IZO's original proposal and its theoretical
revision and expansion by Kandinsky had been abandoned. Instead, the
new museum was devoted exclusively to the work of living artists. This
substantial modification did not bother radical leftists

<b></b>

on IZO's payroll, such as Rodchenko, who were vastly more interested in
shaping the present and the future than in constructing past pedigree.

<p>
Over the course of 1919, Rodchenko and Stepanova had developed a close
friendship with Kandinsky, and since September of that year had been
living in the house of Vasily and Nina on Dolgii pereulok.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  But Rodchenko's increasing involvement with the Museum through the
  course of 1920&#8212;in February 1920 he replaced Drevin as Bureau
  Head&#8212;coincided with his growing impatience with Kandinsky's
  artistic and museological priorities. While Kandinsky had attacked
  the typical historical sequence as but the dilution of art history
  into mere chronicle, Rodchenko went much further.

<p>
In a paper presented to a conference of the regional directors of
IZO Narkompros, Rodchenko proposes stripping IZO's museums of any
historicizing function whatsoever. The art-historical museum of the
past, he asserts, bears "the form of an archive"&#8212;within the
vanguard imaginary, an archive being that place to which things are
consigned once they have been brought to resolution or have otherwise
come to an end, a repository for those things with which one has already
finished. As such, the art-historical museum is built only for the benefit
of connoisseurs, amateurs, and ethnographers, Rodchenko continues,
and never for the benefit of artists themselves. Its universalistic
ambitions are encyclopedic and indiscriminate:<br />
to collect anything and everything without observing any kind of
evaluative criteria other than the artist's degree of notoriety. The
archival character of such a museum is underscored by its installation
practices, particularly its "custom of carpeting the walls from top to
bottom" with paintings arranged in chronological sequence.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
To this art-historical museum of the past, Rodchenko contrasts IZO's new
museum which, in being "built upon <i>living</i> [<i>zhivushchikh</i>]
works of art not yet possessing the quality of 'historical value'
(in the narrow sense of this word)," constitutes a "cultural agent"
(<i>kul'turnyi faktor</i>), a dynamic force in the shaping of the
present and the future. The new museum of living works rejects any
hagiographic function: It is built upon works (formal inventions) rather
than authors (a museological reformulation of Heinrich W&ouml;lfflin's
<i>Kunstgeschichte ohne Namen</i>). Its collections are selected according
to two main criteria: First, the degree to which an "inventive factor"
is present in a given work, this factor being that which drives art
forward, destroying any possibility of the latter's transcendence of
its chronotopical specificity: "Everything exists in time and space,
including the work of art." All "dogma," "classical canons," and
notions of "eternal beauty" must be jettisoned, therefore. The second
criterion is a given work's degree of technical or professional skill
(<i>masterstvo</i>). Works are to be grouped and sequenced according
to their respective stages in the development of a particular form or
method, regardless of their author or date of execution. In terms of
installation, the museum's walls will serve as calm and neutral surfaces
upon which paintings will be hung relative to the viewer's eye level
and with adequate room to breathe.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
In a long diary entry of 15 June 1920, Rodchenko begins to flesh out
a model of the museum as a laboratory, prefacing his thoughts with a
note that he had been wanting to write on the subject of "A Museum of
Experimental Technics" (<i>Muzei Eksperimental'noi Tekhniki</i>) ever
since the winter.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  According to his own testimony,

therefore, the inception of Rodchenko's thinking about the foundation of
such a museum thus roughly coincided with his February 1920 appointment as
Bureau Head and Keeper (<i>Khranitel'</i>) of the MZhK's collections. It
coincided also with his production around this time&#8212;in explicit
rivalry with Malevich's 1918 <i>White on White</i> canvases&#8212;of
a series of <i>Black on Black</i> paintings, wherein <i>faktura</i>
("texture," or the "working of the material")
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  became the very subject of the work of art, and the art of painting
  a self-reflexive laboratory operation. Rodchenko was not alone
  in this concern. In a March 1920 diary entry, Stepanova remarks
  upon the recent emergence of a group of artists who are engaged in
  "experimental-analytical" work&#8212;including, besides Rodchenko, also
  Ioganson, Vladimir and Georgii Stenberg, and Konstantin Medunetsky
  (in other words, the soon-to-be constructivists)&#8212;who "talk
  about the future liberation of art from painterly culture."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
While both Kandinsky and Rodchenko shared a commitment to formulating
a museological practice which would emphasize the procedural aspects
of art making, they did so for quite different reasons. If Kandinsky
sought to construct a historical pedigree for his own preoccupation with
composition as expressive means, Rodchenko believed that the museum should
foreground making as the subject itself of art. Accordingly, Rodchenko's
ambitions with regard to his hypothetical Museum of Experimental Technics
were much grander in both scale and media than IZO's original provision
for a small "section" within the MZhK to be devoted to "experimental
technics in painting" (<i>eksperimetnal'noi tekhniki zhivopisi</i>).
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
  While Kandinsky had agreed that the MZhK would collect "pure"
  experiments in form ("to collect all essential and significant
  experiments with the treatment of raw materials&#8212;[e.g.,]
  <i>faktura</i>"), he insisted that such objects were for study
  purposes only (rather than for exhibition). Acquisitions earmarked for
  a technics-specific section began in February 1920&#8212;again, the
  same month Rodchenko became Head of the Bureau. The first acquisition
  for the technics section was a spatial construction by Ioganson;
  works by Rodchenko and the Stenberg brothers soon followed.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  But for Kandinsky, anxious about the incursion of the positive
  sciences into the realm of art, the value of such experimental works
  lay only in their redress of the previous neglect of the problem
  of form in Russian art. They did not, in his opinion, constitute
  works of art per se because their forms, he asserted, "clothe" no
  "pictorial <i>content</i>."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
By contrast, Rodchenko seeks to expand the museum's section of so-called
pure experiments into a full-blown Museum of Experimental Technics,
in which the very air will have "the coldness of a laboratory corpse. . . the dryness of mathematical formulae . . . the analyst's sharp,
unrelenting realism," wherein "everything [will be] invented, broken down,
measured, dismembered, calculated, deliberated, reduced to pure formulae."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  In a related text entitled "Everything is Experiment" (October
  1920), Rodchenko declared the abolition altogether of the traditional
  disciplinary distinction between the experiment and the work of art,
  declaring all his work to be but "experiment."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  Written to accompany his contribution of some fifty nonobjective
  paintings and spatial constructions to the Nineteenth
  State Exhibition&#8212;an exhibition to which Kandinsky also
  contributed&#8212;this wall-mounted manifesto was one of a series
  of interventions

<b></b>

by which Rodchenko announced his "aversion to [Kandinskian] emotion,"
and the coming to an end of his alliance with his former mentor. That
same month, Rodchenko and Stepanova moved out of the Kandinskys'
building and into the living quarters of the Museum Bureau.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  This split had been a long time coming. According to
  Stepanova&#8212;who began working in the Bureau in October
  1920&#8212;Rodchenko was already aware as early as January 1920
  (that is, at precisely the moment when Kandinsky's essay on the MZhK
  appeared in print and just prior to Rodchenko's becoming Bureau chief),
  that easel painting was exhausted, and that new media and methods of
  art making "besides canvas and brush" were needed. Hence, Stepanova
  suggests, the strength of Rodchenko's conviction as to the necessity
  of founding a Museum of Experimental Technics precisely in order to
  accommodate new pigments (enamel and metallic), new tools (rollers
  instead of brushes), and new methods (the ruling of lines instead
  of free drawing), and the constructing rather than the carving or
  modeling of sculpture.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
The difference between Kandinsky's and Rodchenko's respective
theorizations of museum organization&#8212;museum as history of composing
versus museum as laboratory&#8212;was further demonstrated by their
approach to the problem of installation. Although no photographs of the
MZhK have been found,
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  Stepanova's diary contains information apropos its installation
  from which we may infer the general tenor of the way in which
  the disagreement between Kandinsky and Rodchenko played out in
  practice. With the MZhK's definitive installation taking place in late
  May or early June 1920, their disagreement became glaringly evident. A
  sole point of agreement between the two, according to Stepanova, was
  on the issue of abandoning the traditional principle of hanging an
  artist's entire oeuvre within a single gallery; beyond that, their
  approaches radically diverged.

<p>
Stepanova reports that Kandinsky and the painter Robert Fal'k installed
one gallery "without any system" whatsoever, proceeding instead
"simply by feeling." The result was analogous to "the composition of a
painting." "It's good," she admits, "but very emotional." To Kandinsky
Stepanova attributes a so-called eclectic approach to installation,
wherein the main objective was supposedly to create the most pleasing
composition of the overall ensemble of exhibited objects. By contrast,
she continues, Rodchenko's approach was totally "systematic": "from the
start he had in mind a connecting thread [<i>nit'</i>] for the [whole]
gallery." This thread was none other than <i>faktura</i>. One commentator,
the painter V. F. Franketti, described Rodchenko's installation of the
"faktura-gallery" as "incisive." According to Stepanova, Rodchenko's
principle of a connecting or guiding thread was adopted for the
installation of the remaining Volkhonka galleries.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Whether or not Stepanova's comments merely caricature Kandinsky's
installation, it was certainly the case that the latter's museological
model&#8212;a museum that would articulate a teleological narrative of the
history of painting culminating in, say, the Munich Compositions&#8212;had
been thwarted by the restriction of the MZhK's collection to recent
Russian art only. While no less pitched toward conring the MZhK
as a conduit for his own artistic agenda, Rodchenko's museological
model severed this fundamental connection between history and the
museum. Rodchenko not only undermined

<b></b>

Kandinsky's faith in the expressive function of the work of art but
also evacuated the latter's concern with the problem of history,
by elaborating an entirely new function for the museum&#8212;that of
a historyless laboratory of "living forms," wherein the subject of
art was its own production. As such, Rodchenko's model of the museum
as laboratory reprises the substance if not the inflamed rhetoric of
Malevich's initial response to IZO's museological agenda as it had been
presented in Petrograd a year or so earlier. Having sat through the
entire conference, Malevich had protested in the pages of <i>Iskusstvo
kommuny</i> IZO's emphasis on museums devoted to the <i>history</i>
of invention, demanding instead the organization of "laboratories of
a world-wide, creative, building apparatus."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  Thus while it was Malevich who was the first to test the very limits
  of the concept of museability by suggesting the reconration of
  the museum as a laboratory, it was his young rival Rodchenko and his
  circle who first attempted to instantiate this idea in practice.


<h3>

The End of the Laboratory
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In December 1920, Kandinsky resigned as the director of the MZhK in order
to take up a new position in the recently established Russian Academy of
Artistic Sciences, whereupon the museum was placed under the authority
of the Bureau, and Rodchenko appointed as its new director.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
  But while Rodchenko's ambitions for a Museum of Experimental Technics
  shaped his input into the organization of the MZhK, they were not
  ultimately realized on the scale he had intended. Instead, in November
  1920, Rodchenko and his laboratory comrades had to settle for a single
  gallery within the museum overall, and even this space seems to have
  been difficult to secure.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  Among the works included in this gallery were relief constructions
  by Tatlin, a black <i>faktura</i> painting by Rodchenko, a spatial
  construction by Konstantin Medunetsky, and a painting entitled <i>White
  Circle</i> by Vladimir Stenberg.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>

<p>
In this gallery, Rodchenko and his circle of soon-to-be constructivists
sought to abrogate the traditional conception of the space of exhibition
as an arena for contemplative and sensual pleasure in order to transform
the viewer's relationship to the practice of viewing along the very same
lines as the inventor's relation to production had been transformed. In
order to grasp the conceptual path of the artist's experiment, viewers
would have to adopt an "analytical method" which, as Stepanova put it,
was based not on contemplation but on "experimental cognition," "active
thought," and "laboratory work."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  The laboratory artists did not seek to eradicate consumption so much
  as to rescue it from the realm of leisure and contemplation for that
  of labor, thereby adumbrating a model wherein consumption was stripped
  of its former association with acquisition and newly reconred as
  the perceptual activity of an activated, revolutionary subject. The
  consumption of art, in other words, was retheorized as a mirror of
  its production, and Khlebnikov's galactic division thereby called
  into question.

<p>
The ultimate ramifications for Futurist museology of this quest for
an activated mode of consumption were set forth by Stepanova in her
catalogue entry for a group

<b></b>

show held in September 1921 at the Poets' Union on Tverskaia&#8212;the
so-called 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Composition is the contemplative approach of an artist in his creative
work. Technics and Industry have presented art with the problem of
construction as active work and not as contemplative fine art. The
"sacred" value of the work of art, as a singular, unique object, has
been destroyed. The museum, as the repository of this unique object,
turns into an archive.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The connection between this little known declaration of the loss of
aura&#8212;the destruction of the sacred value of the work of art as a
unique object&#8212;and Walter Benjamin's more than famous "Work of Art"
essay was first drawn by Benjamin H. D. Buchloh in 1984.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  If aura was defined by Benjamin as the "unique phenomenon of a
  distance," a remove or separation between the viewer and object of
  his or her gaze, "however close it may be," a kind of psychological
  inapproachability or authority that results from the object's
  rootedness in tradition ("The uniqueness of a work of art is
  inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition"),
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  then it was precisely this distance that the laboratory practitioner
  sought to overcome by replacing a traditionally passive, contemplative
  gaze with an activated, productive one. Stepanova's concern, then,
  was the desanctification of not only the unique object, but also the
  act of perception itself.

<p>
Its aura destroyed, its "pull" extinguished, the work of art, from
Stepanova's point of view, no longer had the power to enthrall, absorb,
stupefy; and the museum, as its storehouse, was thus no longer a locus
of enchantment. Redundant, the museum became an archive, the place
to which one consigned that which has already reached its end. The
archive was now the condition of all museums&#8212;including the museum
as laboratory&#8212;Stepanova seems to suggest, and not just that of
the traditional art-historical museum to which Rodchenko had earlier
referred. While one might read Stepanova's declaration as indicative of
her conception of the museum <i>of the future</i> as an archive&#8212;and
hence, perhaps, as encapsulating a kind of institutional critique
avant la lettre ("FF," 90-2)&#8212;such an interpretation would seem to
depend upon a conflation of the laboratory model of "active consumption"
with the notion of the "museum as archive," a conflation unwarranted by
Stepanova's text as I read it. The archival condition of the museum was
instead an emphatically negative one for Stepanova&#8212;it was precisely
that which rendered that institution a now altogether irrelevant vestige
of the past. Although she does not refer to any particular examples in
her brief catalogue statement, it seems to me that the Moscow MZhK would
certainly not have escaped this condition, for at least two reasons:

<p>
The first has to do with the situation of the MZhK itself at the time
of the 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition. In July 1921, Narkompros had closed
the Volkhonka galleries and the Museum's collection had been packed
into crates while new premises were sought. The Museum's closure and
relocation seems to have been mostly connected to the 1921 restructuring
of the Narkompros bureaucracy, but the Bureau had also been subject
to an extremely hostile audit by state authorities (Rabkrin) in May of
that year.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<b></b>

These various developments appear to have been extremely demoralizing
for Rodchenko and Stepanova on account of the sheer amount of energy
they had expended on the Museum. Although Rodchenko was still nominally
its director until March 1922, he and Stepanova seem to have refused
any involvement with its administration after August 1921.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
  At the time of the 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition, the Museum was in boxes
  and its future uncertain.

<p>
The second, and more important, reason for the reorientation of
Stepanova's thinking about the museum in September 1921 had to do with
a radical shift within the constructivist camp itself. Over summer and
fall 1921 the constructivists had become increasingly dissatisfied with
what they derided as "easelism" (a pejorative neologism for the arts
of painting and sculpture). In November 1921, as is well known, they
collectively abandoned easelism altogether, consigning to this category
<i>also</i> their laboratory experiments of the previous year, and, in
the name of securing their own passage from the realm of the aesthetic
into that of the real, announced the transformation of constructivism
into an art of production (i.e., productivism), wherein all energy
would be dedicated to the designing of everyday life. The 5 x 5 = 25
exhibition was an important step en route to this major shift. Although
Stepanova's thoughts were evidently moving faster than her work (she
exhibited rative paintings), among Rodchenko's contributions to 5
x 5 = 25 was his troika of monochromes, <i>Pure Red Color</i>, <i>Pure
Yellow Color</i>, and <i>Pure Blue Color</i>.

<p>
For the constructivists, Rodchenko's monochromes signified that the
history of art, as it had been conceived in the eighteenth century
with the birth of aesthetics and art's isolation from its ritual or
religious function, had reached its end. But this coming to an end
resulted from the expiration of not only its internal dynamic (its
self-reflexive pursuit of painting's irreducible materiality), the
critic and constructivist apologist Nikolai Tarabukin argues, but also
of its external dynamic: the "democratization of the social structure in
Russia" that had eradicated the very class that had fostered the growth
of easel painting since the late sixteenth century. The constructivist
group's subsequent collective call to production was theorized not as
the beginning of yet another aesthetic movement, but as the advent of
another cultural epoch altogether, in which the needs of the new "mass
viewer" (<i>massovyi zritel'</i>) would replace those of the erstwhile
"class consumer" (<i>klassogo potrebitelia</i>).
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
  The immediate ramification of this shift for Rodchenko and Stepanova's
  museological enterprise was that, having theorized the MZhK as a
  laboratory (a site of active rather than passive production and
  consumption)&#8212;a model partially realized in the designation
  within the MZhK of a separate gallery devoted to experimental
  technics&#8212;they discarded this model altogether in 1922 in
  favor of the factory floor, the designer's workshop and, eventually,
  the darkroom.

<p>
From 1922 on, the constructivists no longer sought to orchestrate the
active consumption of works of easelist art, therefore, but rather
the consumption of the <i>bytovoi</i> (the realm of everyday life), as
opposed to the <i>zhivoi</i> (the realm of aesthetic and philosophical
speculation). The "stagnating slime" of <i>byt</i>&#8212;the conventions
and habits of everyday life&#8212;was thus no longer to be repressed,
but instead dynamically activated by the reinvigoration of the objects
with which, and environments within which, everyday

<b></b>

life was carried out. Rodchenko's design for a <i>Workers' Club</i>,
for example, installed in the Soviet Pavilion at the Exposition
Internationale des Arts D&eacute;coratifs et Industriels Modernes held
in Paris in 1925, reconred proletarian leisure as a dynamic, active,
propaganda-consuming activity.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
  But if the Moscow constructivists abandoned their now erstwhile
  ambition to activate the space of the museum as a laboratory,
  their contemporary and chief rival El Lissitzky took up precisely
  this ambition in his extraordinary <i>Demonstrationsr&auml;ume</i>
  realized inDresden in 1926 and Hannover in 1927-28: If the viewer
  had once been "lulled . . . into a certain <i>passivity</i>" by
  conventional exhibition practice, Lissitzky writes, "[my] design
  should make the man <i>active</i>."
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Aftermath
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
What was the ultimate fate of the MZhK, once Kandinsky and the
constructivists had left it behind? In December 1921, Kandinsky
headed off to the Weimar Bauhaus on a cultural mission on behalf of
the Russian Academy of Artistic Sciences. He never returned. Stepanova
and Liubov Popova became involved in textile production at the First
State Textile Print Factory (formerly the Tsindel'), Ioganson in the
design of production apparati at Krasnyi Prokatchik, and Rodchenko in,
among a great many other things, graphic design for the state trust for
agricultural products, Mossel'prom. In the meantime, the MZhK remained
in storage for nearly a year, reopening only in April 1922 in smaller
premises on Povarskaia Street under a new director, Petr Vil'iams,
a middle-of-the-road painter who championed precisely those easelist
values that the constructivists had rejected in fall 1921. To raise funds,
Vil'iams even sought to sell the Museum's collection of three-dimensional
work on the grounds that such work was incompatible with its profile as
a museum of <i>painterly</i> culture.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
  In 1924, the MZhK moved to the former Stroganov school on Rozhdestvenka
  in 1924,
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
  where it remained until 1928, when it was made a branch of the
  Tretyakov Gallery, and then a department within the latter and finally,
  in 1929, abolished altogether. What the Tretyakov's custodians deemed
  "museum-worthy" in the MZhK (e.g., Kandinsky's abstract compositions)
  was then merged with its collections; the rest (e.g., the laboratory
  constructivists' experimental technics) was sold or otherwise
  "liquidated."

<p>
But there is a further chapter to the story of the Russian museums
of contemporary art. During the winter of 1927-28, the future founding
director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, Alfred Barr, spent two months
in Moscow and Leningrad scouting out recent developments. In his diary,
Barr records a visit to the Moscow MZhK on Rozhdestvenka where he "found
the best collection of the finest twentieth-century Russian painters,
better by far than the Tretyakov. . . . The cubists, cubo-futurists, and
suprematists were there in serried ranks, also the postexpressionists."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
  Two days later he was in the studio of Rodchenko and
  Stepanova. Rodchenko, apparently, answered Barr's questions "in a
  rather disgruntled manner, insisting that the past bored him utterly
  and that he couldn't remember at all when he had painted this way or
  that. . . . [but he] showed much satisfaction at having delivered the
  death blow to painting in 1922 [<i>sic</i>]." To which Barr retorts
  smugly in the privacy of his diary that new groups of

<b></b>

Russian easel painters "have thriven" since 1922 ("RD," 125), thus
evading the historical significance of Rodchenko's declaration of the
death of painting&#8212;namely, the constructivists' shift into industrial
production, and their adoption of technologies of mechanical reproduction
and collective distribution.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>

<p>
One of the last entries in Barr's diary recounts his visit to the Russian
Museum in Leningrad, into which had been folded in the summer of 1926 some
five hundred works from the Petrograd Museum of Artistic Culture. Its
curator Punin&#8212;"perhaps the finest of Russian critics of modern
art," according to Barr&#8212;walked the latter through the modern
galleries, which then comprised what was known as the Department of New
Tendencies. The collection on display was small (about fifty paintings)
but well chosen&#8212;"exactly the sort of collection which we lack in
any American gallery except Duncan Phillips's" ("RD," 136). In 1929,
the year that the Tretyakov liquidated the Moscow MZhK, Barr played a
crucial role in MoMA's foundation. Before any account of the genealogical
connection between Futurist museology and Barr's own enterprise can be
attempted, however, a fully diachronic history of the former between the
years 1919 and 1929 would need to be written. Suffice to say, in closing,
that the form in which Barr saw those collections in 1928 in the Russian
Museum bore little resemblance to the museological ambitions&#8212;the
laboratory of living forms that would activate the viewer and thereby
constitute a new, revolutionary subjectivity&#8212;that Rodchenko's
circle had had for them in the aftermath of October.

No substantive history of the Moscow MZhK has been written; the present
discussion thus draws together scattered archival and other primary
sources such as conference proceedings, polemical essays, diaries,
and contemporary guidebooks. Over the course of the last decade,
Svetlana Dzhafarova has been researching the fate of contemporary
art sent by Moscow to provincial cities; see "The Creation of the
Museums of Painterly Culture," in <i>The Great Utopia: The Russian

<p>
Before we get to this essay's main feature, let's start with the
cartoon. In July 1936, Warner Brothers released a lively Merrie Melodies
short directed by animator Fred "Tex" Avery called "I Love to Singa."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  It borrowed its title song from <i>The Singing Kid</i>, a recent
  full-length Warner vehicle for Al Jolson and Cab Calloway. But
  it borrowed plot and nearly everything else from <i>The Jazz
  Singer</i> . Alluding to this earlier, more celebrated Warner
  Brothers/Jolson teaming, the cartoon crystallized and replayed as
  farce the role that ethnic "novelty" once had played in shaping the
  language of American entertainment, particularly the language of jazz
  performers and jazz performance.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Like <i>The Jazz Singer</i> before it, "I Love to Singa" played
  commercial jazz as a New World form shot through with the accents of
  a transnational America, accents whose dissonance within the

<b></b>

imagined nation had troubled the would-be 100 percent Anglo-Saxonist
harmony of 1920s nativism. What's more, "I Love to Singa" sounded this
dissonance, not as something distinct from the commercial mainstream, but
as something inherent to it, a modernist effect generated and sustained
by the make-it-new imperative that drove the entertainment industry's
cycle of innovation&#8212;novelty&#8212;and planned obsolescence.

<p>
For the post-Great War decade, jazz had resonated as a style in which
transnational ethnicity and mass-mediated novelty could intersect to
unsettle standard ideas of American national identity and the language
through which it was being imagined. These connections could be quite
explicit in a pop song such as Frank Silver and Irving Cohn's Tin
Pan Alley jazz smash of 1923, "Yes! We Have No Bananas"; the frankly
commercial register worked by the song's vaudeville Greek linked
a novelty chorus to a counternativist vision in its verses&#8212;a
remaking of American business, language, and national identity in
New Immigrant accents to which I'll return (see <a name="1"
HREF="10.2jerving_res.html#1"> 1</a>).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  That same resonance served the literary work of a wide range of
  writers; I'll concern myself particularly with the early work of
  Samson Raphaelson, a writer of short stories, plays, ad copy, and
  screenplays. For Raphaelson, commercial jazz served as a powerful
  re and production model for a mass-directed, transnational
  "Americanese" challenging nativist harmony; first, in his story "The
  Day of Atonement"  and, later, in the stage version of <i>The
  Jazz Singer</i>  to which Raphaelson adapted it.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
And this brings us back to the dissonant sounds that structure the
economy of ethno-national identifications in "I Love to Singa." Inside
the eminently respectable-looking tree from which "Prof. Fritz Owl"
has hung his shingle&#8212;"Teacher of 'voice piano &amp; violin,'
but"&#8212;separate shingle&#8212;"NO JAZZ"&#8212;we find the good
Professor wearing out the carpet (literally, of course) waiting for
Mrs. Owl's brood to hatch. He taps each egg apprehensively; three
dutifully deliver a sweet bell tone, the fourth resounds with the
tinny crash of a jazz drummer's sock cymbal. What hatches confirms this
rather heavy-handed cymbalism. To the Professor's admiring estimation
emerge, in turn, a "Caruso" belting out an aria, a violin-playing
"Fritz Kreisler" and a flute-playing "Mendelssohn." But from that last
egg&#8212;oh!&#8212;steps a red-jacketed, blue-bow-tied, hand-clapping,
apparently already well-seasoned vaudevillian who salutes his parents with
a "Hello, Strenzer!" and goes into his dance singing the title tune. At
his first singing lesson in the next scene, the unwilling student intones
"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes" in the most nasal, sarcastic voice
he can muster, but interpolates enthusiastic, hushed snatches of "I
Love to Singa" into the breaks when his mother turns the pages of her
piano accompaniment. The song-a that this "Owl Jolson" loves to sing-a
is a parodic compendium of Tin Pan Alley clich&eacute;s and moon/June
rhymes about love, spring, blue skies, bluebirds, tea for two, the South,
mom, and the flag. Inevitably, the Professor walks in on his son getting
hot. "Enough is too much!" he bellows. Throwing his son out on his ear,
he sputters, "You hot-cha! You crooner! You falsetto! You jazz singer! You. . . You . . . You . . . Phooey!"

<p>
The scene, of course, echoes one in <i>The Jazz Singer</i> in which an
Old World father walks in on his son jazzing up "Blue Skies," meeting
the spectacle with a horrified bluster that drives the son into the open
arms of commercial entertainment, for good

<b></b>

maybe. The scene also invokes the ethnically inflected model of
generational conflict of the earlier film, a conceit almost overburdened
by the multiple fictive and metafictive levels at which it is reinforced:
in <i>The Jazz Singer,</i> a cantor's son named Jakie Rabinowitz chooses

named Asa Yoelson who chose not to follow in his Old World father's
footsteps, instead Americanizing his name and entering show biz as
"Al Jolson"; Jolson sings a tune by a cantor's son named Israel Baline
who chose not to follow in his Old World father's footsteps, instead
Americanizing his name and entering show biz as "Irving Berlin." Even the
tune Owl Jolson sings was penned by a cantor's son named Hyman Arluck who
(you guessed it) chose not to follow in his Old World father's footsteps,
instead Americanizing his name and entering show biz as "Harold Arlen."

<p>
But the cartoon does not exactly follow through on the "set of
conventions for narratives about race and Oedipal conflict" that Krin
Gabbard has argued were inaugurated through <i>The Jazz Singer,</i>
narratives "in which the white hero transcends his ethnic background
through success as a popular entertainer imitating African Americans"
(<i>JM,</i> 37). In one of its details, the cartoon seems to do just
that: Owl Jolson's song links "a cheer for Uncle Sammy / With another
for my mammy," Americanization with minstrelsy. But his jazz voice never
"transcends" ethnicity, never asserts a national identity that whites out
intra-Euro-American distinctions by assuming a stance of shared racial
difference from (or identification with) blackness. His <i>salut au
monde</i>&#8212;"Hello, Strenzer!"&#8212;would have been recognizable as a
catchphrase used by Sam Hearn's Schlepperman on Jack Benny's nationally
popular radio show, a character whose stage Yiddishisms allowed the
show to indulge in an ethnicness that Benny downplayed in his own comic
persona. Deploying this greeting, Owl Jolson announces a break with Old
World (and trans-European) "seriousness" in order to pledge allegiance
to a mass-media aesthetic simultaneously American and ethnic. Indeed,
the lyric hook of his signature song is built around the same signifying
"ga" that, in novelist Anzia Yezierska's <i>Bread Givers</i>, marked
young Aby's continuing distance from a linguistic mainstream defined
by his teacher according to Anglo-Saxonist standards. In its vocal
cadences&#8212;sing-a/spring-a, moon-a/June-a&#8212;the song gently
parodied Al Jolson's way of singing&#8212;a style, as Gilbert Seldes
once observed, in which the perfunctory blackface mask Jolson adopted
"goes well with diversions in Yiddish accents."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  Seldes's observation was common in contemporary accounts of Jolson
  and other Jewish writers and performers such as Fanny Brice, Irving
  Berlin, or Sophie Tucker: a trope that red their success as due
  to, and not despite, their perceived difference within the imagined
  national community. Moreover, the trope red ethnic dissonance
  as part of entertainment's nation-defining role, its contribution to
  the gospel of novelty that made American mass culture what it was.

<p>
In response to his father's "Enough is too much," itself Yiddishized
English, Owl Jolson picks himself up, dusts himself off, and starts all
over again in direct, emphatic address to the camera&#8212;"That's mein
'pop.'" This three-word masterpiece of dialogic construction embodies the
cartoon's sense of a self-conscious, densely multivocal American style:
one that like Owl Jolson's signature song artfully, ludically combines
high with low, Old World with New, proper English with Damon Runyonesque
slang. As you might expect, the young entertainer's family eventually
learns to stop worrying and to love to sing-a too: for the final scene,
they even join the chorus line. That their hybridized utterance earns
a first prize on the "Jack Bunny" radio amateur hour places

<b></b>

"I Love to Singa" in the belated company of the feature presentation
to which I'll turn now: those early soundings of jazz that heard in the
music's commercial drive for novelty the potential for a transnational
style of sustained dissonance.

<p>
In <i>The Dialect of Modernism</i> , Michael North has noted
that writers from Joseph Conrad through Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot,
Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Jean Toomer, and Zora Neale
Hurston took on a "black" voice at key moments in the development of
modernism. North argues that "linguistic mimicry and racial masquerade
were not just shallow fads but strategies without which modernism could
not have arisen," black dialect&#8212;at least what was imagined to be
black dialect&#8212;a technical model for challenging standard ways of
putting black on white on the page.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  But while North clarifies this dialectic&#8212;illustrating
  particularly well the tangled position into which it put black
  modernists&#8212;he obscures the extent to which American modernism
  brought other ethnic, regional, occupational, and institutional uses
  of English into dialogic, oppositional, and revisionist play with
  shopworn standards.

<p>
This play was important because the nativist policing of language was
central to policing ideas of nation. The equation of language and loyalty
often was quite blunt:
the first sentence learned by Ford English School students was "I am a
good American." And in 1919 Congressional hearings for an Americanization
bill, Woodrow Wilson's Special Assistant Herbert Kaufman asserted,
"If a hundred million of us must stand together, we must think together,
and think without a foreign accent."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  In 1921, H. L. Mencken mused about the dithers into which the official
  institutions of American letters were likely to be thrown by a recent
  British embrace of the controversial (if now unknown) Welsh Irish
  American writer, Frank Harris: "One imagines the painful sensation in
  the <i>New York Times</i> office, the dismayed groups around far-flung
  campus pumps, the special meetings of the Princeton, N.J., and Urbana,
  Ill., American Legions, the secret conference between the National
  Institute of Arts and Letters and the Ku Klux Klan."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  The scenario paid specific tribute to several members of the American
  Academy (an upper chamber for the National Institute of Arts and
  Letters): editor John H. Finley of the <i>Times</i>, Henry Van Dyke at
  Princeton, and Stuart Sherman at the University of Illinois. Through
  his inimitable hyperbole&#8212;linking literary reputation brokers to
  the American Legion and the KKK&#8212;Mencken suggested how debates
  over American language and the literature that would exploit it were
  often framed in Romantic philology's racialist terms.

<p>
North shows both defenders and challengers of standards&#8212;both
those Mencken called "Anglomaniacs" and those Sherman called "literary
Mohawks"&#8212;buying into the Herderian assumption that "language is
the surest representation of a people to itself."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Thus debates over American literary language tapped deeper wells
  of debate over melting pots and miscegenation, reversion and
  restriction. If James Oppenheim could argue in the February 1920
  <i>Dial</i> that modernist poetry was "Our First National Art"
  precisely because it used "our American speech, the resultant of a
  new environment,

<b></b>

mixture of races and new experience," then Royal Cortissoz equally could
warn against the "Ellis Island Art"  such a mixture was likely to
produce. The prominent art critic wrote darkly that "the United States
is invaded by aliens, thousands of whom constitute so many acute perils
to the health of the body politic. Modernism is of precisely the same
heterogeneous alien origin and is imperilling the republic of art in
the same way."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
The same repulsed reaction to the language of othered ethnic
groups&#8212;or to difference itself coded as ethnically
other&#8212;fueled the writing of critic Stuart Sherman. Sherman,
the English department chair at the University of Illinois, was a
self-proclaimed antimodernist conservator of the "Puritan" spirit in
American letters after the war. Early 1920s immigration restrictionism
was paralleled in the fine distinctions Sherman drew around those
writers who might count as <i>Americans</i>  and around those
kinds of writing that could be assimilated into "The National Genius"
 or <i>The Genius of America</i> . In "The National Genius,"
Sherman argued through "a little series of neglected truisms" for an
inherent connection between aesthetic conformism and national worth: "An
artist is a man living in society. A great artist is a great man living
in a great society. When a great artist expresses himself completely,
it is found that he has expressed, not merely himself, but also the
dominant thought and feeling of the men with whom he lives."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  Given the apparent distributive property of greatness,
  Sherman's syllogism leads, logically, to the Eliotic
  conclusion&#8212;twenty-three years before "What Is a Classic?<br />
"&#8212;that to be a writer of national importance was to be "in a benign
conspiracy with one's time and place, and to be upborne by the central
stream of tendency" ("NG," 82). Sherman hinted that America's young
<i>intelligentsia</i> (the foreignness of the word was itself important)
were double agents within that conspiracy, succumbing to siren songs
"from beyond the borders of Anglo-Saxonia," songs devised by the "quick
Semitic intelligence" and sung in "super-subtle Italian fashion" ("NG,"
75, 78). Sherman thus troped the "tendency" of "National Genius" through
terms that, in their political register, conspired in anything-but-benign
ways against the inclusion of "Alpine" or "Mediterranean" (not to speak of
"Negroid" or "Mongolian") currents within the nation's "central stream."

<p>
Following the appearance of "The National Genius" in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, the then-liberal <i>New Republic</i> took Sherman to task for
"that particularist Americanism which in its essence requires exclusion,
ill-will, pride and prejudice&#8212;Anti-Semitism, Anti-Germanism,
Anti-Irishism, Anti-Russianism, Anti-everything else."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Sherman's biographers have argued this was an unfair characterization
  of his work. But their examples in his defense are not terribly
  convincing, and some&#8212;such as his protestations of nonhostility
  toward Jews in reply to charges brought by Ludwig Lewisohn&#8212;smack
  loudly of some-of-my-best-friends-ism plain and simple.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  But even if Sherman didn't have it in for any particular New
  Immigrants, he did not regard them in general as a force for good in
  rerouting the central stream of "Puritan" tendency. "I have really
  presented my notion of the way our non-'Anglo-Saxon' element is
  affecting and threatening to affect our literature," Sherman wrote
  in his cover letter to the <i>Atlantic Monthly;</i> "Of course I
  recognize, as I suppose everyone does, that there are innumerable non-Anglo-Saxons 
  
  <b></b>
  
  who are quite as fully in sympathy with our best
traditions as the natives. At the same time, I think it true that the
<i>spiritually</i> alien strain in our recent literature is largely
ascribable to the later importations of European blood and culture."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
There is, then, considerable irony to the fact that a key voice within
the counter-Anglo-Saxonist choir of the early 1920s belonged to one of
Sherman's some-of-my-best-friends friends, a former student named Sampson
(later "Samson") Raphaelson. On 14 April 1920, Raphaelson wrote Sherman
from Mill Valley, California, with news of having begun a story that
was to be "a study in contrast between the old Jewish cantor and his
son who is a black-face comedian and ragtime singer in musical comedy."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  The finished story would be purchased for $125 and published
  in <i>Everybody's Magazine</i> in January 1922 as "The Day of
  Atonement." Long after Raphaelson's graduation from the University
  of Illinois in 1917, Stuart Sherman would remain a mentor re for
  the younger writer. The two writers shared what seems to have been
  a genuine and mutual respect.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  But as the scion of a family of Russian Jewish immigrants to
  Manhattan's Lower East Side, Raphaelson would have been an example
  of that "later importation" of non-Anglo-Saxon European blood and
  culture so disruptive to Sherman's view of American literature's
  puritan tendency. And, as a careful reading of "The Day of Atonement"
  indicates, Sherman wasn't far wrong. Raphaelson was modest about the
  story's achievement, telling an interviewer in 1973 that "it wasn't
  a bad story, but it wasn't a particularly distinguished story. It's
  readable."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  But the story is important for its expression, both in narrative
  and in language, of a historically specific and "spiritually alien"
  vision of the national genius quite different from Sherman's.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
What All the Bums They Sing
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Raphaelson made central to "The Day of Atonement" the conceit that his
postwar jazz singer "was simply translating the age old music of the
cantors&#8212;that vast loneliness of a race wandering 'between two
worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born'&#8212;into primitive
and passionate Americanese" ("DA," 151). The cultural deadlock implied
by the (unattributed) Matthew Arnold quotation was engulfed within and
countered by the more hopeful trope of "translation"&#8212;of bringing
across. Raphaelson would recall having been struck by this conviction as
an undergraduate when he saw Al Jolson perform in <i>Robinson Crusoe,
Jr.,</i> on the show's 1917 stop in Champaign, Illinois. "My God," he
remembered saying to the woman beside him, "this isn't a jazz singer. This
is a cantor!"
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  "The Day of Atonement" would plot this same intersection of jazz and
  Jewishness along the broad lines of Jolson's well-publicized tale
  of humble beginnings, his parents' expectation that he would be the
  next in a long line of cantors, and his choice instead to work as a
  popular entertainer.

<p>
But in contrast to the Jolson story, Raphaelson's tale saw his protagonist
ultimately honoring his father's wishes, achieving his own "day of
atonement" though missing his Broadway break to sing in his late father's
place for Yom Kippur services at the Hester Street Synagogue. By virtue
of this choice, "The Day of Atonement" might seem to be at heart just
another of many anti-jazz stories that would make their mark in the early

<b></b>

1920s, of a piece with Julian Street's "The Jazz Baby"  or
J. Hartley Manners's play <i>The National Anthem</i> .
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  To these cautionary tales&#8212;which indulged in <i>frisson-</i>filled
  flirtation with flaming jazz youth only, by narrative's end, to fold
  prodigal excess back into the waiting arms of family and continental
  Culture&#8212;"The Day of Atonement" might merely be seen to offer
  a novel non-WASP twist on the casting.

<p>
But to read "The Day of Atonement" as an anti-jazz fable neglects its
jazz singer's near seamless resuturing into the synagogue even as he
retains stylistic markers of vaudeville. If Jakie/Jack largely submits to
the procrustean demands of the "perfectly fitting suits of Anglo-Saxon
severity" in which the New World metonymically drapes him ("DA," 147),
Raphaelson's story finally insists that popular music represents not an
absolute break with the past so much as a smithy in which the created
conscience of a "primitive and passionate Americanese" might be forged
from the alloy of Old and New. This point is made through the story's
have-it-both-ways ending, which has Jack's agent phoning his business
partner from just outside the synagogue with the news that he'd just heard
"the greatest ragtime singer in America in the making" ("DA," 167).
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  But the point is established even from the story's opening sentences:
  a montage in which the novelty of Jakie/Jack's jazz is shown to make
  a new betwixt-and-between identity possible:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"What Jack Robin needs," said David Lee, who owns some of the whitest
of Broadway's white lights, "is a wife."
<p>

"What our Jakie needs," said Jack Robin's father, old Cantor Rabinowitz,
of the Hester Street Synagogue, "is a God."

<p>

"What I need," said Jack Robin, "is a song-number with a kick in it. The
junk that Tin Pan Alley is peddling these days is rusty&#8212;that's
all&#8212;<i>rusty</i>." ["DA," 147; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Owl Jolson, Jack is distinguished from his father by his talk. Yet
his snappy language&#8212;"kick," "junk," "rusty"&#8212;also distinguishes
him from David Lee, the manager who represents Anglo-Saxonist success (the
whitest of the white). Significantly, Jack declares a disidentification
with Tin Pan Alley's established product, troping it as last year's
model sadly in need of an antioxidizing shot of novelty. Indeed, Lee's
statement is syntactically identical to that of Yosele Rabinowitz, even
as it opposes its New World model of consensual relations ("a wife")
to the cantor's vision of a chosen people's descent ("a God").
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  That is to say, Jack Robin's language exceeds and supplants the
  standards offered by either his father or his manager, the choice
  between an Eastern European Yiddishkayt and U. S. Americanization.

<p>
Rejecting both standards, Jack, like Owl Jolson, instead pledges
allegiance to the flag of "kick": a modernist, un-"rusty" stance not
because it utterly abandons Old to cleave to New, but because like
Eliot's Sanskrit texts or H. D.'s Hellenism or Picasso's African masks,
it shapes a new setting for some very old stones:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Those dark eyes of his might have been the ecstatic eyes of a poet in the
days when the Chosen People lived sedately in the land of Canaan. They
might have been prophetic eyes, stern and stirring, in the years of
Zedekiah, son of Josiah, King of Judah, when Jerusalem "knew not its
God." They might have been deep wells of lamentation even one generation
ago had his lyric voice been born to cry the sorrows of Israel in a
Russian synagogue. ["DA," 147]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



Jack's seeming vaudeville carelessness is betrayed by "dark eyes"
and a "lyric voice" that reveal a lurking "Russian kind of morbidness"
(Russian "soul" being an alternately euphemistic and metonymic re
in contemporary explanations of Jewish stage performers and jazz
writers like Jolson, Brice, Berlin, or Gershwin), a "sentimental
grief" that finds him at eighteen "howling dolefully the strains of
'Down by the Old Mill Stream'" and eased of the "ache of happiness"
by the "plaintive blare of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band.'" "How could the
old cantor," asks the narrator, making the point painfully explicit,
"or for that matter, Jakie himself, understand that instead of being
sinful and self-indulgent, loose and lazy, this grave-eyed boy with
the ways of the street was sincerely carrying on that tragic tradition
disguised ironically with the gay trappings of Broadway and the rich
vulgarity of the East Side?" ("DA," 151).

<p>
The story gives this generalized "Russian" morbidity specific
musical import through its nearly identical descriptions of Jack's
religious and vaudeville performance style. The "caressing quavers"
and "lilting plaintiveness" ("DA," 151, 154) of Jack's ragtime voice
find their parallel in his story-ending rendition of the "Kol Nidre"
"rising from a low sing-song into a quivering, majestic wail and then
breaking into incoherent plaintiveness" ("DA," 165). And in his first
dance with Amy Prentiss, Jack takes his cue from a violin's "slim
pattern of simple melody, which was being tortured into savage bedlam
by the bulletlike spitting of the drum and by the saxophone's gusts of
passionate whining." Jack "seemed, somehow, to make of the simple steps
a wild, heart-breaking aria, a mad pounding on the doors of heaven"
("DA," 157). This doubleness in Jack/Jakie's performance identity belies
Yosele's absolutist lament that he has "no son at all" ("DA," 151).

<p>
Though the story doubted that Jakie himself had this understanding, the
play made him accomplice to its demonstration, a conscious dramaturge
staging the link between jazz singing and Jewishness. <i>The Jazz
Singer</i> opened on 15 September 1925 at Broadway's Fulton Theatre
and ran for more than three hundred performances with vaudevillian
George Jessel in the lead (Jessel was also originally slated for the
movie). The years spanned by "The Day of Atonement" were telescoped into
two twenty-four-hour homecomings separated by a month. Jack's return
found him attempting to reconcile his two worlds for his parents through
his music, as he lined out the resemblance between a Hebrew prayer tune,
"Ain Kelohenu," and a popular song:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Nothing ever hurries me, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing ever worries me,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Easy come,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Easy go,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's all the same to me!"
<br />
I just got them mixed, Papa&#8212;See? [<i>JS,</i> 51]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The script directed both to be sung "to exactly the same tune and with
exactly the same plaintiveness but with a new rhythm and shaking his
shoulders. . . . This does not have quite the effect which Jack innocently
had hoped for." Nor does Jack's commentary: "Where did I learn to sing
like that? From Papa&#8212;who else? . . . If he were born here, like I
was, he would probably be singing jazz, too" (<i>JS,</i> 51-2). Jack's
efforts may

<b></b>

meet with the same horror that met Owl Jolson a decade later, but they
present possibilities for translating Old World "plaintiveness" into
New World "rhythm."

<p>
Moreover, Jakie/Jack succeeds aesthetically, as both a vaudevillian
and a cantor, not despite, but due to this doubleness and the novelty
it represents. "Chee, but that baby can rag!" said Jakie's first
East Side audiences "as they swayed, hypnotized, to the caressing
quavers of his voice" ("DA," 151). After their dance, Amy tells Jack,
"You dance differently from any one I know" ("DA," 157). Having found
the same quality of difference in his singing, she asks (anticipating
David Lee's conclusion), "Hasn't anybody let you in on the secret that
you're one of the few real rag-singers in America?" ("DA," 156). And the
congregation for his synagogue performance hears Jack sing "with a high
broken sobbing which, they insisted critically, surpassed his father's in
his best days. . . . he sang the grief-laden notes with a lyric passion
that was distinctly his own" ("DA," 165). Those vestiges of difference,
and their translation into the unlikely settings of movie palaces,
vaudeville houses, and back in their roundabout way into the synagogue
made Jack "no ordinary singer of ragtime," and no ordinary cantor either.

<p>
And it is difference itself, rather than any particular ethnic form
it takes, that makes Jack Robin a New World, un-"rusty" performer:
jazz style in "The Day of Atonement" is less an essentialized Jewish
temperament than a historically specific matter of one immigrant
other's dissonant ethnic relation to what Stuart Sherman had called the
"central stream of tendency." The story has its moments in which this
difference is essentialized, and this would be still truer of the play
and film (I'll return to this idea later in the essay). But with greater
regularity, Raphaelson sounded jazz and ethnicity as things unsettling
to identity&#8212;particularly the identity of any too-easy national
harmony. Jakie hears jazz in the "dissonant rumble of response from the
congregation, the restive shufflings of youngsters" in the synagogue
("DA," 155). In his preface to the stage <i>Jazz Singer</i>, Raphaelson
would re jazz as a synecdoche for the "vivid contrast of surfaces"
in American life and the "vital chaos of America's soul," and its jazz
singer through a "vision of cathedrals and temples collapsing and,
silhouetted against the setting sun, a solitary re, a lost soul,
dancing grotesquely on the ruins" (<i>JS,</i> 22). If there was anything
especially "Jewish" to jazz dissonance as Raphaelson red it, it
seems to have rested upon the ur-immigrant position occupied by the Jew
in this writer's economy of difference, and particularly in the trope of
"wandering" to which he repeatedly turned. (Like the story, Raphaelson's
preface to the play would invoke Arnold's re of a race lost "between
two worlds" ["DA," 151; <i>JS,</i> 10].)

<p>
Raphaelson emphasized the uncanny homelessness of this jazz
ethnicity&#8212;the performance of relational novelty that it
encouraged&#8212;by tracing Jack's talent repeatedly back to an
indefinable, unspeakably amorphous "it"-ness. When Jakie sings in an
East Side movie house, his audience "instinctively . . . responded to it"
("DA," 151). When Jack wishes he could dance "standing straight and moving
sort of&#8212;well, evenly and correctly," Amy Prentiss tells him, "I'm
crazy about the way you dance. . . . I've been crazy about the very thing
in you that you're deprecating. I wish I had it. I'd give <i>anything</i>
to have it. It&#8212;it hurt me a lot to find your performance to-day
lacking in it" ("DA," 158; italics in original). David Lee tells him,
"I don't know what it is, but you

<b></b>

have the <i>capacity</i> to get it. I've seen it show suddenly in talented
performers, sometimes overnight" ("DA," 162; italics in original). And in
the play, when Jack asks a reporter, rhetorically: "What has the story of
my life got to do with the way I put over a jazz song?" his love interest
(named Mary Dale in the play) answers, "Everything, Jack. . . . It's
a new note" (<i>JS</i>, 79). Ann Douglas describes the 1920s use of
"it" (as with "It Girl" Clara Bow) as "a pop version of Freud's id,
an undefinable voltage of openly sexual energy."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  But Raphaelson's jazz narratives suggest that the charge of "it" also
  derived, in part, from the challenge that culture industry novelty
  presented to settled categories of ethnicity and nation. "It" would
  be the new note behind the "primitive and passionate Americanese"
  that Raphaelson's jazz tales promised.

<p>
Raphaelson's sounding of jazz might be heard in more general terms, its
nation-revising model of ethnic novelty mapping out a strategy for other
sorts of culture industry workers&#8212;including writers of magazine
stories and Broadway plays. Indeed, a Jack Robinesque doubleness of ethnic
style is much in evidence in Raphaelson's own writing, and particularly
in his multiple, novel allegiances to Standard English, Yiddish, and the
hybrid vernacular that made up Hester Street's "richly filthy East Side
argot" ("DA," 148). Yiddish not only appears in his use of particular
vocabulary and phrases (whose italicization flags their foreignness),
but also in much of the English that is refracted through recognizably
Yiddish syntax. "Bum!" Yosele Rabinowitz excoriates Jakie, "In a synagogue
you don't even put your head." "Maybe," he tells his wife, "maybe when he
gets older, he'll see how beautiful is <i>Yiddishkeit</i>. Maybe he would
stop hanging around music-places and singing these ragstime [<i>sic</i>]
songs what all the bums they sing" ("DA," 150; italics in original). And
he finally laments, "Better I shouldn't have it no son at all" ("DA,"
151). (By the time Laurence Olivier would get his chops around this line
for the 1980 Neil Diamond remake of <i>The Jazz Singer</i>, his lament
would be boiled down to a simple, Standard "I have no son.")
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Both Raphaelson's Standard and his Yiddishized English were further cut
with the novelty of East Side slang and its connection to entertainment
world jargon. His use of this "richly filthy" argot&#8212;"kick," "rusty"
("DA," 147), "yeller," "shiner" ("DA," 148), "baby," "rag" ("DA," 151),
"kiddo," "wallop," "skirt," "bunk" ("DA," 152)&#8212;allowed him to
posit the essence of "Americanese" in its lack of essence: modern Hester
Street's doubly disidentified and culturally hybrid avoidance of all
things "rusty." Near its end, the story sounds a note demonstrating just
this sense of language in flux. Jack's final performance&#8212;singing the
"Kol Nidre" and the Kaddish with his jazz-inflected style&#8212;seems
to inspire in its auditors a vortical image of how a hybrid, shifting
Americanese might look, sound, and feel: "Beat it! Go home bums,
loafers! Ain't you got no respect for the <i>Chazon</i>? G'wan! Can't you
leave some peace be even on Yom Kippur. <i>Paskudniks</i>!" ("DA," 166;
italics in original). As the collective voice of the Lower East Side
rises, it does so in a dissonant, modernist montage of sacred Hebrew
("Yom Kippur"), Yiddish invective ("Paskudniks"), Yiddishized English
vernacular ("Go home bums, loafers"), and Hester Street slang ("Beat it,"
"G'wan"). An East Side kid himself, Raphaelson could present himself thus
as a conductor of this modernist dissonance: like Jakie/Jack, a re
"dancing grotesquely on the ruins" of a putatively

<b></b>

premodern purity and stability, provisionally orchestrating these
fragments of language and style into something novel&#8212;"It's a
new note."

<p>
Americanization proponents may have worked to elide exactly those
notes signifying their subjects' ethnic particularity or hyphenated
hybridity&#8212;the way English teacher Sara Smolinsky worked to
elide the signifying "ga" of Aby's speech in Yezierska's <i>Bread
Givers</i>. Indeed, Stuart Sherman seems to have hoped his student
would come around in much the same way. While he encouraged Raphaelson
to mine his heritage, Sherman was less than comfortable with the
Owl Jolsonesque mixed forms that Jewishness seemed to be taking in
Raphaelson's representation of ethnicity under New World consumer-society
modernity. Sherman wrote Raphaelson:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When you really plumb the depths of that great Jewish tradition which
you have only dipped your fingers in, you will certainly find yourself
more in sympathy with what a gentile might call its Miltonic elements;
and you will interest yourself for the modern equivalents of them, and,
I suspect, won't be quite satisfied with your singer's rag-time as the
full modern equivalent for the old Hebrew chants.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But Raphaelson's work insisted that Jack Robin's "rag-time" was important
not because of its essential cultural difference from nor its identity
with the Anglo-Saxon strain of American culture. Rather, jazz resonated
for Jack and his audience through its novel drive toward a transnational
double consciousness that Raphaelson portrayed as central to a particular
moment's cultural response to urbanizing, corporatizing American life:
the betwixt-bothered-and-bewildered modernism of those newest kids on the
block, uniquely positioned to choreograph an allegory of this particular
modernity's ruins.

<p>
The ethnicized innovations of a Jack Robin or a Samson Raphaelson depended
on their mass dissemination for whatever cultural effect they were to have
on the imagined national community and its language. Indeed, their novel
Americanese threatened Standard operating proceduralists precisely to the
degree that it might be iterated and reiterated indefinitely through the
developing entertainment industries. Jack's new note was broadcast far
beyond Hester Street over a national vaudeville circuit that brought him,
over the course of "The Day of Atonement," to Atlantic City, Buffalo,
Chicago, Dallas, Denver, New Haven, New Orleans, New York, Salt Lake
City, San Antonio, San Diego, and San Francisco. When Hamlin Garland
took up the matter

<b></b>

of the American Academy's newly established Medal for Good Diction on the
Stage, he suggested enlarging the scope of the award to cover emergent
mass-media forms such as radio, through which "minor errors in speech"
were being multiplied "into major offenses against society."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  According to Neil Leonard, commercial jazz predominated within the
  music that itself constituted three-fourths of all radio programming in
  the 1920s; such a predominance had been behind <i>Etude</i> magazine's
  1924 adjuration to "'Listen in' on the radio any night. Tap America
  anywhere in the air and nine times out of ten Jazz will burst forth."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  Jazz&#8212;disseminated through vaudeville, radio, recordings, piano
  rolls, movie house orchestras, movie scores, and sheet music&#8212;was
  not only a metaphoric model for what the Academy feared, but also a
  wide-ranging bearer of it.

<p>
These entertainment industries and their jazz rewarded ethnic diversions,
so long as they could be marketed as novel turns in the cycle of
planned aesthetic obsolescence. Tin Pan Alley&#8212;so dubbed in 1909
by journalist Monroe Rosenfeld as he took note of the cacophony of
Manhattan's songwriting district on West Twenty-eighth Street between
Fifth Avenue and Broadway&#8212;worked all sorts of variations on Jack
Robin's new note, teaching audiences to sing-a in Yiddish, Irish,
Hawaiian, African American and other accents, through songs such as
"That's Yiddisha Love" , "Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, That's an Irish
Lullaby" , "Oh! How She Could Yacki, Hacki, Wicki, Wicki, Wacki,
Woo" , and "(Lena is the Queen of) Palesteena." The more mixed
the mix, the better&#8212;witness "Yonkle the Cow-Boy Jew" ,
"I've Got Rings on My Fingers (Mumbo Jumbo Jijjiboo J. O'Shea)," "Yiddle
on Your Fiddle Play Some Ragtime" , "Yiddisher Irish Baby" ,
"Rosie Rosenblatt, Stop Your Turkey Trot," "Since Maggie Dooley Learned
the Hooley Hooley" , "Yiddishe Blues" , "That's Yiddisha
Jazz" , and "Yiddisha Charleston" . Richard K. Spottswood's
seven-volume discography of ethnic recordings&#8212;which were aimed,
like similarly niche-marketed "race" or "hillbilly" catalogues, at
subnational groups&#8212;further attests to a culture industry willing
to recognize and perpetuate a transnational America. The Great War had
given the ethnic record industry an invaluable boost as it cut off the
production and supply of recordings from overseas and "as immigrants
from war-torn countries sought material that reinforced their cultural
ties in America and reassured them that all was not lost at home."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  All told, the ethnic, linguistic dissonance generated by popular song's
  make-it-obsolete imperative presented a significant and persistent
  challenge to those who would have imagined the United States as a
  homogenously Americanized, 100 percent Anglo-Saxonized nation.

<p>
It's pretty to think so, anyway. But if dissonance was generated
through the contradictions inherent in Culture, Inc.'s business cycles,
it was also consistently contained and harmonized, the minor threat
of any particular novelty generally rendered harmless by pop's uncanny
ability to eat itself. For proof, we need only consider the fate of that
greatest of all ethnolinguistic sallies from the Alley: "Yes! We Have No
Bananas." This immense "jazz" hit began life in 1923 as a mild ethnic
joke, and in its optimistic take on ethnic dissonance, it acted as the
virtual obverse of the Anglo-Saxonist center-cannot-hold modernism of
contemporary High Art productions such as <i>The Waste</i>

<b></b>

<i>Land</i> .
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  In contrast to T. S. Eliot's poem&#8212;though, like it, marking
  time during a national political movement toward immigration
  restriction&#8212;"Bananas" sounded global production and consumption,
  the urban concentration of an ethnically diverse population, the
  Fordizing of entertainment, and other hallmarks of American modernity
  as opportunities for linguistic and national reinvention. Yet even in
  its own day, the link between "Bananas" and debates over ethnicity was
  being forgotten. Performances of the song, such as Paul Whiteman's
  use of it at his celebrated 1924 "Experiment in Modern Music" at
  Manhattan's Aeolian Hall, came to focus on the chorus's harmless
  patchwork of nonsense rather than on the ethnicized social context
  explicit in the song's verses.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  "Bananas" has since been remembered largely as the epitome of pop
  dada, the "all-time top in the school of musical nonsense," as Sigmund
  Spaeth put it in his 1948 <i>History of Popular Music in America,</i>
  rather than as a clarion call to lift immigration restrictions so
  that American English might continually be remade in the accents of
  its non-Nordic transplants (to use the racialist parlance by which
  the older, northern European immigrants were distinguished from the
  newer Mediterranean or Alpine models).
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
As a pop phenomenon, "Yes! We Have No Bananas" stands in that crowded
line of fleeting 1920s crazes&#8212;beauty contests, Mah-Jongg, Emil
Cou&eacute;, crossword puzzles, King Tut&#8212;that defined "America
Convalescent" for contemporary historian Frederick Lewis Allen. In <i>Only
Yesterday</i> , Allen reported that the song and its catchphrase
"penetrated to the remotest farmhouse in the remotest county": it was the
"I've fallen and I can't get up," the "who let the dogs out" of its day.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  The emphasis on raw sonic materiality in the song's chorus also
  placed it within Tin Pan Alley's fad nonsense tradition along with
  "Hitchy-Koo" , "Snooky Ookums" , "The Aba Daba Honeymoon"
  , "Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble" , and "Heebie Jeebies" (1925,
  the song for which Louis Armstrong "invented" scat singing). In both
  lyric and melodic construction, "Bananas" could well serve as the
  technical model for a poetics of modernist mass-cultural montage,
  particularly in the concatenation of vegetation featured in the song's
  chorus and filtered through some rather breathtaking experiments in
  syntax, orthography, typography, and performance cues:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->

<br />

But, YES! we have no bananas; we have no bananas today.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">

["Y!" lines 9-15]
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The story behind the music also provided a model instance of mass
culture's collective, anonymous, even cynical division of labor. Famously,
the chorus pilfered and patched together well-known tunes from a range of
classical, folk, operatic, and Tin Pan Alley registers: the "Hallelujah"
chorus from George Handel's <i>Messiah</i> ,

<b></b>

the traditional Scottish air "My Bonnie," Michael Balfe and Alfred Bunn's
"I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls" from the opera <i>The Bohemian Girl</i>
, and (borrowing a phrase itself recently pilfered for Cole Porter's
"Old-Fashioned Garden" [1919]), a popular American song from the 1860s,
"When I Saw Sweet Nellie Home" (also known as "Aunt Dinah's Quilting
Party"). To guard against plagiarism charges, the writers checked the
song with Porter's publisher Max Dreyfus. Dreyfus changed the direction
of one note and gave it his okay.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  The hands pulling together these strands were several as well. The song
  was written originally by one-hit wonders Frank Silver and Irving Cohn,
  and performed at Long Island roadhouses and New York restaurants to
  apparently indifferent response by Frank Silver's Music Masters. It was
  rejected by Waterson, Berlin, and Snyder (Irving Berlin's publishing
  house), but was picked up by selling agents Shapiro, Bernstein,
  and Company. By the time they were through with it, staff writers
  Elliott Shapiro, Jimmy Hanley, Lew Brown, and Ballard MacDonald each
  had contributed lines. Sales were sleepy until vaudeville star Eddie
  Cantor interpolated the song into <i>Make It Snappy!</i> to provide
  extra material for the revue's Philadelphia run. The audience demanded
  multiple encores, and when Cantor recorded the song for Victor it
  began to achieve what Henry Osgood would call its "insane" popularity.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
To guess at the reasons, one could point to its faddish ludic
lyric materiality and its prodigal use of time-tested melodies
(as well as some plugging by a major star). But beyond this, one
might consider also the song's celebration of American "pep" in the
face of modernity's challenges. Like much professionally produced,
mass-consumed entertainment, "Yes! We Have No Bananas" presented a
utopian world of possibilities, lyrically and musically: a structure
of feeling that offered what Richard Dyer has termed "temporary answers
to the inadequacies of the society which is being escaped from through
entertainment."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  The song answered unequal wealth distribution with the spectacle of
  abundance: no bananas, to be sure, but "all kinds" of other fruits
  and vegetables, and a vast storehouse of musical motifs readily
  available for consumption; even the song's self-conscious novelty
  displayed faith in a future of similarly ephemeral pop hits. It
  countered alienated labor's exhaustion and dreariness with manic
  vaudeville energy (speed, rhythm, punch) and performative intensity
  (vivid accents, exclamations). It defused suspicions of political and
  commercial manipulation by offering a case of Tin Pan Alley plagiarism
  whose operation was plainly, playfully transparent. And through the
  similarly transparent bait and switch of the song's fruit-selling
  protagonist, the song dismissed the anatomized, antagonistic relations
  of individuals under the system of commodity exchange, giving a
  knowing wink that invoked a knowing "we."

<p>
Yet Dyer also reminds us that if entertainment's utopianism responds to
real, felt inadequacies, it addresses "only those gaps or inadequacies
that capitalism proposes itself to deal with."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  More systemic lacks are left out of the picture: persistent economic
  disparity, structural racism, patriarchal relations. Even at the
  time, the song's prophylactic ideological function was noted
  by J. W. T. Mason, a New York correspondent for the <i>London
  Daily Express:</i> "Cardboard imitations of bunches of bananas
  are making their appearance bearing the legend, 'Yes; we have no
  bananas.' Business men

<b></b>

hang these ornaments in their offices, as a reminder that, after all,
there must be a way out of every difficulty."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Where <i>The Waste Land</i> dug up only "dried tubers" (<i>WL,</i>
  line 7), the vegetation ceremonies of "Bananas" promised to keep
  its listeners supplied up to their cauliflower ears in "Long Island
  po-TAH-toes," in the process diverting more basic questions about
  postwar displacement, alienation, and lack. Yes! We have no water
  under this red rock; but just look at that Eddie Cantor go!

<p>
It is perhaps for this reason that the Baroness Else von
Freytag-Loringhoven&#8212;dadaist poet, sculptor, and self-proclaimed
aesthetic "aristocrat"
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 &#8212; approached "Yes! We Have No Bananas" with a good deal of
 irony. In "A Dozen Cocktails &#8212; Please" (undated, but most likely
 from 1923) she wrote:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
No spinsterlollypop for me &#8212; yes &#8212; we have
<br />
No bananas &#8212; I got lusting palate &#8212; I
<br />
Always eat them &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;
<br />
They have dandy celluloid tubes &#8212; all sizes &#8212;
<br />
Tinted diabolically as a baboon's hind-complexion.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What followed mimicked the material, nonrepresentational formal abundance
of ad-speak, popular song, and the sweep of a radio dial. Through its
sound and fury, "A Dozen Cocktails" proposed that high modernism was being
out-Joyced, out-Moored, and out-Pounded by the radical collage offered
every day in mass circulation magazines and over the airwaves. Yet the
poem maintained a careful distance from the kind of nation that could be
imagined through mass forms. Near its end, it cuts to what sounds like
a conversation among ad moguls discussing how best to get poets to do
their dirty work:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
How are we going to put it befitting
<br />
Lifted upsys?
<br />
Psh! Any sissy poet has sufficient freezing
<br />
Chemicals in his Freudian icechest to snuff all
<br />
Cockiness. We'll hire one.
<br />
Hell! Not that! That's the trouble &#8212; &#8212;
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
"Sissy poets" as trouble: wishful thinking? Maybe. But her scenario
presented the dilemma of an avant-garde whose best new approaches for
probing surfaces (analytical collage) and depths (psychoanalysis) had
already been pressed into the service of profit.

<p>
Yet if the "Bananas" chorus could get kicked around as the very model
of entertainment at work, its ludic utopianism addressing only what
was already deliverable under the status quo, the song's verses suggest
another angle entirely. Indeed, the utopianism of "Bananas" might be said
to face the facts of modernity's shifting margins and cultural centers
more squarely than the "futile gestures" and "cynical resignation" that
for Matthew Josephson (reviewing <i>The Waste Land</i> for <i>Broom</i>
in January 1923) marked a diversionary dystopian strain within modernism.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  This dystopianism could slip rather easily into simple
  scapegoating&#8212;see Eliot's vague allusions to Eastern Europe's
  "hooded

<b></b>

hordes" (<i>WL,</i> line 369). In contrast, "Bananas" brought front
and center an ethnic type marked for marginalization under developing
national policy:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
There's a fruit store on our street,
<br />
It's run by a Greek.
<br />
And he keeps good things to eat
<br />
But you should hear him speak.
<br />
When you ask him anything,
<br />
Never answers "no";
<br />
He just "yes-es" you to death
<br />
And as he takes your dough he tells you:
<br />
YES! we have no bananas . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
["Y!" lines 1-9]
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>



<p>
In the latter part of 1923, vaudeville star Belle Baker's "I've Got
the 'Yes! We Have No Bananas' Blues" kept this ethnic dimension of the
original in plain view:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Day by day, week by week
<br />
It's "Yes! We have no bananas."
<br />
Everytime that Greek meets Greek
<br />
It's "Yes! We gotta no bananas."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider the irony of the song's "insane" popularity&#8212;enough to
justify an exasperated answer song&#8212;in light of a political climate
busy engendering the legal, congressionally endorsed restriction on the
impact that Southern and Eastern European immigration might have on the
American nation and language.

<p>
This so-called New Immigration&#8212;which included Jews, Italians,
Greeks, Arabs, and Slavs, among other Southern and Eastern European
national and ethnic groups&#8212;had been characterized by its opponents
through its supposed social, biological, and especially linguistic
unassimilability. Between the 1880s and World War I, one-fifth to
one-quarter of the work force of Greece had, indeed, set their backs
to Athens and other places, joining the many Greeks (and Armenians and
Syrians) then leaving Asia Minor during the final troubled decades of
the Ottoman Empire. The majority went to the United States, New York in
particular, where many did, in fact, work as fruit peddlers and small
greengrocers. In a manner typical of the othering tropes to which Greeks
and other New Immigrants were subject, this development would be cited
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1908 as evidence of immigration having
"even tapped the political sinks of Europe."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  The immigration predominant since the 1890s had brought vast numbers
  of people "shut out from the great common medium of expression,"
  as the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> put it in April 1919, "for whom
  a President's proclamation or a village ordinance is so much Greek,
  whom the flux of events and opinions that shapes national life can
  not reach except indirectly or second hand."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
As if in direct answer to this persistent charge of unassimilability,
"Yes! We Have No Bananas" featured a Greek storekeeper who had no trouble
at all&#8212;well, just "fun" trouble&#8212;integrating into the life of
"our street." Indeed, the extra choruses included

<b></b>

in later printings of the song's 1923 run suggested that this storekeeper
had succeeded all too well in incorporating a recognizably American
mix of small-time grift and public relations chutzpah: "We'll sell
you some Swiss cheese, / When you open up this cheese / It gets up and
walks away" (lines 32-4). But what's more, and what's interesting, the
song insisted that his economic integration was not predicated upon any
wholesale assimilation to Anglo-Saxonist standards. Indeed, his novel,
ethnically accented rewriting of American English was rendered as both
the point of the sale and, in fact, the point of the song. As a review
of <a href="10.2jerving_res.html#1">re 1</a> shows, this
linguistic dissonance had its visual counterpart in the cover art to the
sheet music sold by Shapiro, Bernstein, and Company, art that played
up the storekeeper's stereotypically "ethnic" dress, facial features,
and gestures.

<p>
And, to quote Jolson, you ain't heard nothin' yet. By its second verse,
the song was working overtime to extend its commercial, aesthetic,
and transnational opportunities to untold others:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Bus'ness got so good with him
<br />
He wrote home to say,
<br />
"Send me Pete and Nick and Jim,
<br />
I need help right away."
<br />
When he got them in the store
<br />
There was fun, you bet.
<br />
Someone asked for "Sparrow-grass,"
<br />
And then the whole quartette all answered:
<br />
YES! we have no bananas . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">

</blockquote>

<p>
Let's do the math here. The first percentage-based quota law in the United
States was passed in May 1921. Sponsored in the House by Republican Albert
Johnson (the anti-Wobbly, anti-Japanese representative from Washington),
it set the number of admissible immigrants at 3 percent of those counted
as foreign-born residents from any given nation in the 1910 census. If
the logic of this formula escapes you, don't be surprised: the numbers
and dates were rigged to discriminate specifically against the New
Immigration. Because the bill did not discriminate well enough (from the
100 percenter's standpoint), David A. Reed, a Republican Senator from
Pennsylvania, pushed for a revision of the act that reset the quota to
2 percent of all Americans who presently claimed origin from any given
nation. Because res for national origins were not yet available in
1924, the act actually signed into law red quotas based on the number
of foreign-born residents as counted in the 1890 census. As John Higham
reports, this meant cutting the Italian quota from 42,000 to about 4,000,
the Polish from 31,000 to 6,000 . . .

<p>. . . And the Greek from 3,000 to 100.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  All by their lonesomes, Pete, Nick, and Jim would have constituted
  a full 3 percent of the Greek total officially admissible for 1924.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  Now compare these res to the new math of "Bananas." As legislation
  was making its way into law that would reduce Greek immigration by
  a factor of thirty,

<b></b>

"Yes! We Have No Bananas" proposed instead to increase&#8212;indeed, to
quadruple&#8212;the number of Greeks doing business on "our street." And
the song made this pitch on the premise that the immigrant remaking of
the nation and its language&#8212;"so much Greek"&#8212;would be "fun,
you bet!" The last extra chorus admits that "This song isn't pretty, /
But still it's a ditty, / That grows on you day by day," and enjoins a
national community to come together thus:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And you can all do something for us
<br />
Just join in the chorus.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Spoken) <i>All together!</i>
<br />
YES! we have no bananas; we have no bananas today.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p>
Thus, in the midst of Higham's "Tribal Twenties," "Yes! We Have No
Bananas" countered an Anglo-Saxonist nativism with a utopian vision
(and sound) of how things might be otherwise, politically as well as at
the point of purchase.

<p>
It's not hard to imagine how this narrative of integration and
transnational revision might appeal to Frank Silver, Irving Cohn,
or Eddie Cantor, all Jews whose future immigration was likewise
targeted by the Johnson-Reed Immigration Restriction Act. So it is not
surprising that the song exhibited crossover appeal in recordings aimed
at other New Immigrant markets. In July 1923, according to Richard
Spottswood's <i>Ethnic Music</i> discography, an Italian version of
"Bananas" (attributed to E. Migliaccio and Irving Cohan [<i>sic</i>])
was recorded as the flip side to "O Ritorno A 'O Paese (Returning to
the Home Town)." Two versions were recorded for Columbia on the same
date in Yiddish: as "Ye Ch'ob Nit Kein Panenis" by Gus Goldstein and as
"Yes! Mir Hobn Keyn Banenez" by Goldstein with Clara Gold. The Goldstein
and Gold recording emphasized intra-immigrant, and even intra-Yiddishe
novelty, featuring choruses variously rendered in Litvak, Galitzianer,
and Italian dialects. The Belle Baker answer song from the same year,
"I've Got the 'Yes! We Have No Bananas' Blues," produced its own ethnic
catalog equivalent: "Gevalt! Di Banenez" (Yikes! The Bananas), written
by Joseph Tanzman and recorded by David Medoff, in which an exasperated
narrator ducks into a synagogue to escape the ubiquitous tune but finds
it being sung by the cantor as well.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  The "Bananas" phenomenon, thus, might be heard to function as a
  cross-New Immigrant reaction to the nativism behind the push for
  restriction, and also to those aspects of the Americanization movement
  that were calling for ethnic assimilation or "refinement."

<p>
The song's wide cross-ethnic appeal might even be heard as a broader
rejection of the antimodern strategies by which nativism proposed
to meet the facts of a globalizing economy and the ethnic hybridity
of urbanization. Certainly contemporary attempts to account for its
popularity framed it within what Werner Sollors calls a "universal
regeneration" model of the melting pot, in which new streams of
immigration were held to be a necessary reminder of what it meant to be
"American."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  Even though "TAD" Dorgan's cartoons were known to be the source of
  the song's title, many accounts nevertheless took the verse lyrics
  at their word, attributing the phrase to vendors

<b></b>

of varying immigrant identities. (In one version, the vendor was not an
immigrant at all, but a fruit seller in Manila encountered by soldiers
in the Spanish-American War who brought the line back with them to San
Francisco.) Mason's report for the <i>London Daily Express</i> linked
the catchphrase to a range of New Immigrant groups:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The phrase originated in the fruit shops kept in New York by Greeks,
Italians, and Jews, whose knowledge of the English language is limited
in verbiage, but not in volubility, nor in willingness to try.
<p>
These ancient races come to the New World for profit, and never like
to turn a customer away. So they have evolved a curious positive and

Mason concluded, "The phrase is a tribute to the optimism of the newly
arrived immigrant; to his earnest t to master the language of his
temporary country, and so, somehow, is supposed to take on the American
characteristic of 'getting there,' even though by way of an affirmative
in a negative sentence."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  Like the song, Mason saw opportunities in immigration for regenerating
  American English. "New York slang usually changes monthly," he
  wrote. "Of late there has been a falling off in inspiration, and
  picturesque argot culled from the city's polyglot interminglings has
  fallen sadly behind New York's quick-witted reputation" (<i>SLA,</i>
  367). "Yes! We Have No Bananas"&#8212;picturesque, polyglot, and
  quick-witted&#8212;offered evidence that commercial jazz, inescapably
  implicated in the entertainment industry's dialectic of novelty and
  obsolescence, could still fill the void and provide Americanese with
  its new notes.

<p>
This commercial jazz vortex in which machine-age noise could coincide with
ethnic dissonance was short-lived. With the accelerated capitalization and
centralization of the music industry of the later 1920s, popular music
was drawn out of the liminal cultural spaces in which it often operated
and drawn toward a single, moneyed national center. With the creation of
the National Broadcasting Company radio network in 1926, followed the
next year by the Columbia Broadcasting System, the new media behemoths
extending from New York were able to swallow many phonograph companies
and put a policy-setting fear of God into the others. Mergers among film
studios, vaudeville circuits, and music publishing houses placed most of
commercial entertainment in a very few, very large hands (a centering only
furthered with the economic depression of the 1930s). Neil Leonard has
shown how vertical integration encouraged the production of music salable
"through every medium to as many people in as many places as possible."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
  This meant&#8212;as a glance at Roger Lax and Frederick Smith's
  <i>Great Song Thesaurus</i> for these years confirms&#8212;that
  novelty produce like "Bananas" lost out increasingly to delocalized,
  de-"ethnicized" fare.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
Bandleader Paul Whiteman, ever at the jazz-as-business avant-garde,
already had anticipated this trend toward refinement in his 1924
"Experiment in Modern Music."

<b></b>

Just one year after its publication, Whiteman presented "Yes! We Have No
Bananas" as a "Comedy Selection"&#8212;not for its cheerful dismantling
of Anglo-Saxonist ethnocentrism and a restrictive national immigration
policy, but for its clever montage of older tunes. Doing so, he set a
precedent&#8212;listen, for example, to song plugger Clarence Senna's
"How To Write a Popular Song" &#8212;in which footnoting the song's
sources became a standard part of its performance.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  As "tune detective" Sigmund Spaeth wrote in his <i>History of Popular
  Music,</i> "It makes an amusing trick to sing the original words
  wherever possible, creating this extraordinary text":


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Hallelujah, Bananas!
<br />
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
<br />
I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls&#8212;
<br />
The kind that you seldom see.
<br />
I was seeing Nellie home,
<br />
To an old-fashioned garden
<br />
But, Hallelujah, Bananas!
<br />
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me!
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a singer might be struck by how closely this collage&#8212;in its
abrupt shifts in tense and tone; its mix of operatic, folk, religious,
secular, Standard English, and classical registers; not to mention its
invocation of religious mantras of transcendence, intimations of a lost
Culture, vegetation ceremonies, and nostalgia for love lost o'er water
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 &#8212;resembles the closing of <i>The Waste Land</i>:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I sat upon the shore
<br />
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
<br />
Shall I at least set my lands in order?
<br />
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
<br />
<i>Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina</i>
<br />
<i>Quando fiam uti chelidon</i>&#8212;O swallow swallow
<br />
<i>Le Prince d'Aquitaine &agrave; la tour abolie</i>
<br />

<br />

<p>
Indeed, Whiteman, Senna, and Spaeth's glossing of "Bananas" functioned
like Eliot's own last-minute footnotes for <i>The Waste Land</i>
(fifty-two in all, six for this climactic barrage). Eliot would
maintain the notes simply padded a poem "inconveniently short" for
publication&#8212;a nice recognition of modernism's necessary engagement
with the market&#8212;but Michael Kaufman has argued they "provided Eliot
a means of molding critical opinion and offered a guide for interpreting
the poem as a carefully structured, unified whole."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  Just as Eliot's post hoc plan brought his poem to dwell in marbled
  halls, centered in hoary European motifs like the Grail and the Fisher
  King, so, too, tune detective performances of "Yes! We Have No Bananas"
  located the song's innovations

<b></b>

squarely within traditions of European opera, English classical music,
and Scottish and Anglo-American folk song rather than the New World
activities of Jewish, Italian, Greek, or Filipino economic global
subjects. Moreover, this performance strategy made the song's creating
center not the New Immigrant introducing newness into the nation,
but rather the established "native" subject orchestrating preexisting
fragments of a Northern European American Culture and shoring them
against its ruins.

<p>
In his travels from page to stage to screen, Jakie Rabinowitz traced a
course that likewise refined away his messy and multiple ethnic, national,
and occupational identifications, boiling down its jazz singer to an
orchestrator of already extant cultural detritus. For Michael Rogin,
perhaps the filmed <i>Jazz Singer</i>'s most astute interlocutor, the
movie's "subject" is in fact its "blackface method," burnt cork "the
magical substance and transitional object" through which its Jewish jazz
singer finds a voice, achieves commercial success, and bridges Old World
ways and New World ambitions. But if <i>The Jazz Singer</i> was haunted
by blackface's implied racial absence, and further by what Rogin calls
the "structuring absence" of anti-Semitism, it was also haunted by its
own history as a portrait that had not always been drawn in blackface's
bold, clean, Americanizing lines.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Raphaelson's letters to Stuart Sherman might have described the story in
its planning stages as a struggle "between the old Jewish cantor and his
son who is a black-face comedian and ragtime singer in musical comedy,"
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  but the written story never directly connects blackface to its central
  character. It comes closest in song titles that hint at Jack's generic
  "coon" vaudeville persona ("Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Lovey Joe,"
  "When Dat Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'") and through
  oblique reference to another "certain blackface comedian" lacking
  Jack's "swifter, more potent tunefulness" ("DA," 151). The stage
  <i>Jazz Singer</i> gave blackface a more central, and yet ironized
  role. Its middle act takes place backstage while Jack rehearses for
  a show in which he is to play Gus the Porter (a nod to the blackface
  trickster Jolson played in <i>Robinson Crusoe, Jr.,</i> and other
  shows), joking about black hens laying white eggs (<i>JS,</i> 67),
  and singing about "going down South again to the land of cotton and
  jasmine, where the watermelons grow, where I can be with my mammy"
  (<i>JS,</i> 68, and again on 114). The act's second scene (<i>JS,</i>
  102-17) plays charged exchanges among Jack and others against the
  "general business" of blacking up (<i>JS,</i> 103). Yet since Jack's
  rehearsal is offstage with respect to the <i>Jazz Singer</i> audience,
  that audience never is allowed to witness Jack/George Jessel actually
  inhabiting the blackface in performance. Blacking up remains a process
  rather than a completed persona within the play, a gesture quoted
  and defamiliarized as technical routine.

<p>
The film offered the blackface payoff the play withheld. Its closing
image&#8212;Jolson on bended knee, white gloves extended, singing "My
Mammy" to both Mary Dale and an adoring mother&#8212;magically resolved
the narrative's intractable dilemmas through blackface and the sound
that went with it. In good part this was just good business&#8212;the
film's key selling points demanded visible, triumphal performances:
both Jolson's presence and the ballyhooed use of synchronized sound.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
  Jolson's star image was bound up in blackface, and in publicity
  photos that accompanied ads, reviews, and feature articles, this was
  how he often appeared&#8212;as Jessel had not (see <a name="2"
  href="10.2jerving_res.html#2"> 2</a>). Reviews, Rogin

<b></b>

reports, likewise devoted "more attention to blackface than to Western
Electric's new sound and film projection system." And the souvenir
program's cover presented blackface as central to its jazz singer's
split identity, one free-floating Jolson head in blackface just behind
another without it ("BWN," 418, 433).

<p>
Bringing blackface to the fore, the film also delocalized the narrative's
ethnic signifiers. Raphaelson, thrilled by the documentary possibilities
of the camera's sweep

<b></b>

and the new sound technology&#8212;"You heard background noises, as
you went through the East Side, you heard the street sounds, and so
on"&#8212;later recalled his disappointment with the rest of the film:
"The picture opened with East Side shots. Then I saw this cantor. They
'refined' him, you see. His whiskers were beautifully combed, as if he
had been to a beauty parlor. And the mother was made just too spotlessly
clean, as though she were demonstrating stoves or refrigerators."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  The play's success with an ethnic audience&#8212;audiences for its
  initial thirty-eight-week run on Broadway had been up to 90 percent
  Jewish&#8212;had first interested Harry, Al, Jack, and Sam Warner
  in producing the film; paterfamiliasBenjamin Warner had taken a
  particular interest, according to the program, in the "faithful
  portrayal of Jewish home life."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
  And the film exhibited a certain ethnographic interest in Yiddishkayt,
  both in its location shots and in a filmed performance of real-world
  cantor and Yiddish vaudeville star Yosele Rosenblatt. Indeed,
  the Warners emphasized the film's ethnic grounding by scheduling
  the premiere for the eve of Yom Kippur. Yet the increasing 1920s
  capitalization of the entertainment industry, of which Hollywood's
  conversion to sound was symptomatic, brought film production to an
  unprecedented degree under the watchful eye of Wall Street. Indeed the
  great irony of <i>The Jazz Singer</i> is that, as much as any film,
  it pushed an industry once beholden to local, urban, New Immigrant
  audiences into courting a homogenously imagined national audience to
  whom movies, like stoves or refrigerators, might be uniformly sold.

<p>
Blackface in <i>The Jazz Singer</i> thus provided a visual parallel
to the New Immigrant's broader cultural and political disappearance,
from that audience to which American film addressed itself, and from
those tired, poor, huddled masses to which American immigration policy
addressed itself. As a marker of racial identification that itself masked
intra-European ethnic differences&#8212;"by painting himself black,
he washes himself white," Rogin writes&#8212;blackface's new prominence
signaled a change in how ethnicity could be articulated to aesthetic and
national novelty ("BWN," 440). <i>The Jazz Singer</i> film might be said
to have tacitly recognized the success of 1924's Immigration Restriction
Act, removing Yiddishkayt from that "vivid contrast of surfaces, raucous,
sentimental, egoistical, vulgar, ineffably busy" that, for Raphaelson,
had made jazz synonymous with a vital, shifting "Americanese" (<i>JS,</i>
22). The Immigration Restriction Act, as Henry Sapoznik writes, marked
"the beginning of the end for a renewable Yiddish culture in America,"
cutting off the supply of audiences and performers for whom Yiddish was
an everyday language, and thus consigning Yiddish theater and musical
performance to a vanishing past like that of any other "Old Country"
(including the South under King Cotton), a temporal and geographical
otherness to be outgrown through jazz. Like Paul Whiteman for American
dance music or T. S. Eliot for American poetry, the jazz singer (and
<i>The Jazz Singer</i>) was to play the orchestrator of this otherness
in the postimmigration era.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  So "The Day of Atonement," like "Yes! We Have No Bananas," served as
  a kind of swan song for a jazz sounded simultaneously as a challenge
  to an ethnically restrictive version of American culture and as
  a commercial enterprise, exploiting the contradictions of Fordist
  production and consumption from within the belly of the beast.

<b></b>

<p>
To end where we began, we might return to "I Love to Singa" to
consider it, too, as an epitaph engraved at a particular intersection
of jazz language and ethnic novelty. Audiences who went to see <i>The
Singing Kid</i> in April 1936 would have watched Owl Jolson's real life
counterpart deliver his song's opening in the inimitable song-selling
accents of Lower East Side vaudeville, his performance all emotive
sincerity and physical symmetry. But when Cab Calloway took up the tune,
audiences witnessed a clear passing of the jazz novelty torch. Jiving
from side to side in front of a swinging band, doubled over, hair
falling in and out of place, punctuating loose stabs at the melody
with steep, wailing arabesques, Cab Calloway did not so much sell the
song as render it beside the point, a mere vehicle for individualized,
improvised performance.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Indeed, a new kind of jazz musician had emerged since <i>The Jazz
  Singer</i>'s time for whom Jolson's approach would have seemed as rusty
  as Tin Pan Alley's junk had to Jakie Rabinowitz back in 1922. With
  the music industry's centralization in the late 1920s, musicians
  trained in smaller, looser Midwestern ensembles began to be hired
  as jazz specialists by the large Eastern dance bands. They came to
  hear themselves (as did critics and listeners) as a thing apart from
  the tightly arranged, radio-friendly ensembles in which they worked,
  vipers lurking in the nest of commerce. As Richard Sudhalter describes
  the dynamic, "You could take a job with a commercial band in order
  to pay the rent, as long as you didn't take it seriously."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  Jazz became what you did on your own time: woodshedding, after-hours
  jam sessions, brief solo spots in big band arrangements.

<p>
This pop/jazz distinction would shape how writers have approached jazz
since. When sounded now as a model of political and aesthetic practice,
it is as a sound distinct from the commercial/national mainstream, as a
"boogie woogie rumble," to use Langston Hughes's apt phrase.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  But in its early years on the national stage, jazz could be sounded
  as a force for&#8212;and form of&#8212;an anti-Standard, antinativist
  ethnic dissonance boring from within the commercial center of the
  imagined national harmony. Modernist writers in the 1920s who took to
  jazz heard potential for their own work in an emphasis on "novelty"
  that was generated by the demands of cultural production&#8212;what
  I've called its make-it-obsolete imperative&#8212;and that gained
  through its pervasive, mass access precisely the force to reimagine
  the nation and its language.

Ernst Lubitsch for films like <i>The Smiling Lieutenant</i> , <i>The

Hitchcock's <i>Suspicion</i> [1941].) Apart from <i>The Jazz Singer</i>,

Man</i>). Raphaelson also wrote the lyrics to the University of Illinois's
"stadium" song, "t! Illini!" . Aside from Raphaelson's 1925
stage adaptation of this story and the 1927 film that launched a thousand
lips, there also exists a 1927 novelization of the film by Arline DeHaas

In letters to Sherman, Samson Raphaelson consistently requested the "great
favor" of the older man's criticism: "the destructive variety preferred"
(4 March 1918). Once Raphaelson had established himself in New York,
he wrote Sherman to say, "You are still, I'm convinced, the only big
'influence' in my life" (7 October 1922). Sherman papers, box 3, folder

teach rhetoric courses at Illinois for the 1920-21 academic year, and
Raphaelson would thank Sherman, "who encouraged me when my faith lagged,"
in his dedication to <i>The Jazz Singer</i> (<i>JS,</i> 7). In August
1956, Raphaelson wrote a tribute thirty years after Sherman's death
for the <i>Champaign-Urbana Courier</i> titled "Stuart P. Sherman Shook
Mencken's Throne; Termed Illinois' [<i>sic</i>] Greatest Literary Man"
(undated clipping and original typescript, Samson Raphaelson papers,
University Archives, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, box
2). "Now I do not present myself as a specimen of self-found individual,"
he wrote, explaining Sherman's importance to his generation, "But I do
think I am, or was, a fair sample from the significant minority among
the college students of America who were first made articulate in their
insanity by Mencken, and then encountered Sherman like the rising sun
after a night of carousal." He continued, "If this seems to you like
over-simplification, then you were not young in the 1920s. First there
was W. D. Howells; to us, nobody. Then there was Mencken. Then there
was Sherman. That's all there was. There wasn't any more" .

To grasp this re's full obscenity, weigh it&#8212;much as we might
weigh the cost of restricting Jewish immigration from 1930s Germany,
Poland, Austria, or France&#8212;against the Greek refugee crisis
generated by the Greco-Turkish War. By the time Eliot's <i>Waste Land</i>
had found an American home in the pages of the November 1922 <i>Dial</i>,
Mr. Eugenides&#8212;the Greek one-eyed merchant who made Eliot's narrator
an offer he'd be a fool to refuse (<i>WL</i>, lines 215-7)&#8212;would no
longer have had a home base in Smyrna from which to carry currants for
cost, insurance, and freight to London. This Aegean coastal city, now
Izmir in what is now Turkey, was burned to the ground by Turkish forces
in September 1922, killing 30,000 Greek civilians and displacing many
more. Following the war's Turkish victory, a vast, uneven (though largely
peaceful) population exchange was undertaken in 1923: 400,000 Turks
living in Greece and Bulgaria (some sources say 800,000) were evacuated
to the newly established Turkish Republic; 1,300,000 Greeks living in
Turkey (some sources say 1,500,000) were evacuated to Greece. Greece's
population increased by 20 percent in these years; the population of
Athens doubled. If ever there were tired, poor, huddled masses, these
were they, but squeezing them through the freshly-minted quotas would be
like passing New York Harbor's colossal copper statue through a needle's
eye. See "Greece," Library of Congress Country Studies, December 1994,

Maybe so, but as the Manila version suggests, bananas served as a
condensed metonym connecting the consumer economy at home, imperial
entanglements abroad, and the global division of labor (along with its
domestic version in the ethnicization of occupations). In the first
volume of

<b></b>

<i>U.S.A.</i>, <i>The 42nd Parallel</i> (1930; Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
1946), John Dos Passos vividly described these connections in his
portrait of Minor Keith, "Emperor of the Caribbean," and his empire,
"all of it built out of bananas":




<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
in Europe and the United States people had started to eat bananas,
<br />
so they cut down the jungles through Central America to plant bananas,
<br />
and built railroads to haul the bananas,
<br />
and every year more steamboats of the Great White Fleet
<br />
steamed north loaded with bananas,
<br />
and that is the history of the American empire in the Caribbean,
<br />
and the Panama Canal and the future Nicaragua Canal and the marines and
the battleships and the bayonets. [219-20]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
In <i>U.S.A.</i>'s third volume, <i>The Big Money</i> (1936; Boston:
Houghton Mifflin, 1946), one of Dos Passos's "Newsreel" montages linked
"Yes! We Have No Bananas" on the one side to a report of wartime
militarism turned against labor by industrialists like steel magnate
Judge Gary, and on the other to headlines whose language&#8212;"KILLS,"
"BURN," "SUICIDE," "MAD," "HUNT"&#8212;hinted at the violence beneath
Jazz Age prosperity, violence institutionalized in protectionist policies
like the Immigration Act .

Noise: The Jewish Jazz Singer Finds His Voice," <i>Critical Inquiry</i> 18
(spring 1992): 428-9; hereafter abbreviated as "BWN." In arguing as I do,
I part ways with Rogin, for whom blackface's centrality to the film is no
more problematic than its marginality in Raphaelson's story. "Insisting
on the shift from Hebraic particularism to American universalism,"
he writes&#8212;I've been arguing that "The Day of Atonement" is
invested in a particularism simultaneously, to use Rogin's terms,
Hebraic and American&#8212;"neither Raphaelson nor the intertitles
acknowledge blackface as the instrument of that transformation. One
would never know from Raphaelson&#8212;any more than from Henry Ford's
accusation that the 'Jewish song trust makes you sing'&#8212;that
African Americans and not Jews had created jazz" ("BWN," 437). Rogin,
and he's far from alone, regards jazz's origins as the one true key
to its possible cultural meanings (origins he fixes, not incidentally,
in a presumably ethnically untroubled, already completed act), but I've
been arguing that for 1920s audiences jazz was still unfinished cultural
business: not once-and-for-all "created," but still being created and
rearticulated to changing conditions. In this process&#8212;as Ford's
comment suggests&#8212;others other than African Americans, in and
out of blackface, were taking the hit from nativists, restrictionists,
Americanizers, and other 100 percenters.

place Raphaelson's play within the vital Yiddish-language theater of
his time. At the time he was adapting "The Day of Atonement" for the
stage, Raphaelson was also covering Yiddish theater for the <i>New York
Times</i>. "I never went to any other theater when I was a kid in New
York," Raphaelson later remembered: "Who the hell was going to give me
money to do that&#8212;uptown?" (Raphaelson, family tapes, 10 vols.,
8 October 1969 through 10 April 1971, typescript of transcription,

Henry Sapoznik, <i>Klezmer!</i>, 116. Raphaelson's earlier writing itself
carries an unpleasant whiff of this emerging cultural order. With a
defensiveness that probably should be heard against the tellingly nativist
attitude expressed by a <i>Herald Tribune</i> reviewer&#8212;"We know of
no play that requires so thorough an understanding of and sympathy with
the Jew and his faith as does this one," the reviewer identified only
as C. B. D. wrote, complaining of the play's performance in a dialect
"wholly unintelligible to us"&#8212;Raphaelson's preface to his play
proved willing to disinclude African Americans from the "ineffably
busy" surface of contemporary American life. "The Jews," he declared,
"are determining the nature and scope of jazz more than any other
race&#8212;more than the negroes, from whom they have stolen jazz and
given it a new color and meaning. Jazz is Irving Berlin, Al Jolson, George
Gershwin, Sophie Tucker." C. B. D., review of <i>The Jazz Singer</i>,

Jolson and Calloway, perfs., <i>The Singing Kid</i>, 1936. Interestingly,
in 1939 Calloway would record "Utt-Da-Zay," a rewriting of the Yiddish
folk song "Ot Azoy Neyt a Shnyader" (That's the Way a Tailor Sews), a
recording that alternates swung choruses with <i>a tempo</i>, doina-like
vocal cadenzas in which, Henry Sapoznik writes, Calloway "demonstrates
brilliant scatting on the outer edges of the cantorial melisma mixed
with his Jewish jive." The recording was part of a brief late-1930s fad
for swing adaptations of Yiddish and klezmer songs and motifs spurred
largely by the success of the 1937 Andrews Sisters recording of "Bei Mir
Bist du Sch&ouml;n," adapted by Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin from Sholom
Secunda and Jacob Jacobs's 1932 Yiddish theater show tune "Bey Mir Bistu
Sheyn," which Cahn and Chaplin heard performed in a Harlem theater in
1935 by black duet Johnny and George. In 1937, the Andrews Sisters also
recorded "Joseph, Joseph" (from Nellie Casman's 1923 hit "Yosl, Yosl")
and "Sha, Sha Jascha" (from Adolf King's 1923 "Oy, Iz Dos a Rebetsin"
[Oy, Is That a Rabbi's Wife]). At a 1938 Bluebird session, Benny
Goodman trumpeter Ziggy Elman recorded two klezmer tunes: "Bublitchki"
(Peisachke Burstein's 1929 "Beygelekh" [Bagels]) and "Freilach in Swing"
(Abe Schwartz's 1918 "Der Shtiler Bulgar"), which became a hit for
Goodman as "And the Angels Sing." Slim Gaillard recorded "Vol Vistu
Gaily Star" in 1938 using the chord changes from "Yosl, Yosl," followed
by a 1939 paean to "Matzoh Balls" and a rather late 1945 entry: "Dunkin'
Bagel&#8212;Splat in the Coffee." In 1939, scat singer Leo Watson covered
"Utt-Za-Day" and Calloway recorded "A Bee Gezindt" (Molly Picon and Abe
Ellstein's "Abi Gezunt" [You Should Stay Healthy] from the same year),
which would also be recorded by Mildred Bailey in 1940. And Goodman in
1941 recorded "My Little Cousin" (Abe Schwartz's 1921 "Di Grine Kuzine"
[The Greenhorn Cousin]). That most of the original recordings are from the
pre-Immigration Restriction period is telling, and suggests the degree
to which these late-1930s references were a matter of cultural allusion
rather than cultural infusion. See Henry Sapoznik, <i>Klezmer!</i>,
133-40; and Arthur Levy, prod., <i>From Avenue A to the Great White</i>
Way. Sapoznik's assessment of Calloway is from the liner notes to <i>From
Avenue A to the Great White Way</i>, 8.

a Parliament, which asserted its freedom so forcefully that it was
usually kept shut; there was also an Emergency Powers Act that enabled
the government to get along without Parliament, but then, when everyone
had happily settled for absolutism, the Crown decreed that it was time

<p>
Gabriele von B&uuml;low, for whom I was named, was the daughter of the
great Prussian nineteenth-century language philosopher and humanist
Wilhelm von Humboldt; her uncle was the equally renowned naturalist
Alexander von Humboldt. She herself, married to a diplomat and
statesman, was a prolific writer, known today mostly for her extensive
correspondence. Not only is Humboldt University in Berlin named for her
father; there is also a Gabriele-von-B&uuml;low Oberschule in Berlin.

<p>
But what did I, the daughter of Maximilian Mintz, whose Viennese Jewish
family originally came from Galicia (Poland) and Russia, and Ilse
Sch&uuml;ller, both of whose Jewish grandfathers (Sigmund Sch&uuml;ller
and Emil Rosenthal) were textile manufacturers, the former in Br&uuml;nn
(Brno), the latter in Hohenems (near the Swiss border), have to do with
the Prussian aristocracy? Why, for that matter, was my father named for
the late-fifteenth-century Hapsburg Emperor, Kaiser Maximilian I?

<p>
No doubt Gabriele von B&uuml;low appealed to my parents&#8212;and
especially to my mother&#8212;as an intellectual woman, even as
Gabriele's father was admired as a link to Goethe, whose work
von Humboldt disseminated, and Goethe was, for my parents, the
Great Writer and Thinker of the Modern, as opposed to the Ancient,
World. It is difficult for Americans to understand the thirst for culture
(<i>Kulturdrang</i>) of the Viennese Jewish assimilated, if not actually
baptized, upper bourgeoisie&#8212;a <i>Kulturdrang</i> that began with the
"Emancipation" of 1867. Kaiser Franz Josef promulgated a new constitution
that guaranteed freedom of religion and civil rights for all people of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, thus paving the way for the right of Jews to own
property, attend public schools, and enter most of the professions. The
Austrian Jews' extraordinary success following Emancipation&#8212;a
success always shadowed by the widespread anti-Semitism of the empire,
was to come to an abrupt halt with the German <i>Anschluss</i> of Austria
in March 1938. But even in their new homes in New York or Los Angeles,
S&atilde;o Paulo or Sydney, those refugees that managed to escape the
Nazis continued to be attracted to Viennese culture, with its ideals
of <i>Bildung</i>, <i>Wissenschaft</i>, taste, and connoisseurship in
the arts. My own parents and grandparents, settled in Riverdale&#8212;a
name, they were pleased to note, much more respectable than the Bronx of
which it is a part&#8212;continued to speak warmly of the Vienna Opera
or the Kunsthistorisches Museum or the Burgtheater as cultural sites
unrivalled in America, even as <i>Dobostorte</i> and <i>Palatschinken</i>
(crepes)&#8212;those desserts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire&#8212;were
judged to be unarguably superior to such counterparts as Apple Brown
Betty, custard and&#8212;worst of all&#8212;Jell-O, a dessert judged by
the Viennese refugees in New York to be, quite simply, not fit to eat!

<p>
The question of Viennese <i>Kultur</i> is still very much with us, even
though the world of the Dual Monarchy, known affectionately as <i>k und
k</i> (for <i>kaiserlich und k&ouml;niglich</i>, imperial and royal),
collapsed almost a hundred years ago, a casualty of the Great War. In
Los Angeles, where my husband and I have lived for the past twenty-five
years, German and Austrian refugee culture played a decisive role in the
late 1930s and 1940s. The composer Arnold Schoenberg had settled here
by 1934; the writers Thomas Mann, Bertold Brecht, Lion Feuchtwanger,
and Theodor Adorno followed in the early 1940s, all four settling in
Pacific Palisades, not far, as it happens, from my own

<b></b>

house on Amalfi Drive. Evidently the German and Austrian
&eacute;migr&eacute;s were drawn to the Palisades because the hilly,
wooded terrain, with vistas of the ocean, reminded them of their beloved
Italian Riviera; indeed the area is now called the Riviera, and the street
names, like Amalfi Drive, are all Italian: Capri, Sorrento, San Remo,
Napoli&#8212;even the improbable Ravoli (for <i>Ravioli</i>?), which
is around the corner. The former Feuchtwanger home, the spectacular
Villa Aurora, close to the Pacific at the foot of the Palisades,
is now the Foundation for European-American Relations, funded by the
German government through the Goethe Institute and designed to foster
understanding of new developments in literature and art as well as to
commemorate the great achievements of exile culture. On the lovely Spanish
patio of the Villa Aurora, one can observe&#8212;after the lecture or
concert&#8212;an interesting m&eacute;lange of aging &eacute;migr&eacute;s
and young German artists and writers nibbling on little finger sandwiches
(<i>Br&ouml;tchen</i>) and sipping white wine.

<p>
After the war, Mann, Brecht, and Adorno, among others, returned to Europe;
they had, after all, never become acclimated to an America they had found,
especially in its Hollywood incarnation, wholly inimical to a meaningful
cultural and literary development. Schoenberg, like such Austrian film
directors as Fritz Lang, remained; the composer wrote some of his major
works like <i>A Survivor of Warsaw</i> here in his Brentwood home. But
to what extent has his oeuvre been absorbed into American musical
culture? And what does such absorption really signify? As someone whose
"real" identity was once that of Gabriele Mintz, I cannot help but think
about these questions.

<p>
Indeed, the reception of Schoenberg's work in America provides an
interesting paradigm of the contradictions of cultural dissemination as
I have come to know them. A baptized Austrian Jew (later reconverted to
Judaism), Schoenberg was teaching at the Prussian Academy in Berlin when
Hitler assumed power in 1933.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 He fled to the United States, taking up residence in Los Angeles, where
 he spent the last seventeen years of his life. "I still remember,"
 the composer later wrote about his Vienna years, "a man saying with
 authority about me: 'And if he were Mozart himself he must get out.'"
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 In Los Angeles, he taught first at the University of Southern California
 (USC), then at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and
 influenced a whole generation of American composers including John
 Cage, whose Schoenberg stories are legendary. He never set foot in
 Europe again.

<p>
After his death, Schoenberg's family donated his extraordinary
estate&#8212;an archive consisting of major scores and manuscripts, visual
works, letters, and Schoenberg's entire library&#8212;to USC, where the
Schoenberg Institute opened in a small modernist structure in 1975: the
university paid about $500,000 for the building and $300,000 annually
for maintenance and concert activities. When I accepted a chair in the
USC English Department in 1977, the Institute was a major attraction
for me. Under the directorship of Leonard Stein, one of Schoenberg's
most accomplished pupils, it organized concerts, sponsored a journal,
and had excellent small exhibitions of the composer's manuscripts, his
Expressionist paintings, and his correspondence with various artists and
writers. At the entrance, there was a charming replica of Schoenberg's
study on Rockingham Road.

<b></b>

<p>
But although Schoenberg had developed a devoted following in the Los
Angeles of the war years and had had his orchestral works performed under
the direction of Otto Klemperer and Leopold Stokowski, he remained, in
the eyes of the musical public, an "esoteric," largely incomprehensible
composer. It is emblematic that when, after his retirement in 1946 from
UCLA, Schoenberg applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship so as to finish
his great opera <i>Moses and Aaron</i>, he was turned down. At the new
USC Schoenberg Institute, concert attendance was low, and the university
trustees evidently wanted "more bang for the buck," as one administrator
put it. Specifically, the university wanted the Institute to add classroom
space and to broaden the repertoire away from Schoenberg so as to attract
a larger audience. The composer's sons, said to be "difficult" in USC
circles, finally became exasperated and decided to take their archive
elsewhere. But although various universities and institutions expressed
at least some interest, nowhere were sufficient funds forthcoming.

<p>
In 1998, accordingly, the Schoenbergs gave their father's archive
back to his birthplace. In Vienna, it was offered strong government
support&#8212;an unimaginable situation in the United States. The Austrian
government spent $4 million to turn a 6,500-square-foot space in the
Palais Fanto into a state-of-the-art research center, exhibition space
and concert hall. The government also agreed to continue to support the
Schoenberg Center "for the duration" with a budget of around $1 million
a year. The Center's director, Christian Meyer, declared that "Schoenberg
was the most important Austrian composer of the 20<sup>th</sup>  century,
and this is an invaluable opportunity for Austrians to have direct access
to an important aspect of their culture which they might not know as
well as they should."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps this "aspect of their culture" has remained shadowy to
the Austrians because of the amnesia of the Nazi years and their
aftermath. Still, one can only marvel at the Austrian government's
generosity and the taxpayers' willingness to support such a cause. The
Center (<a name="1" href="10.2perloff_res.html#1"> 1</a>)
is housed in the heart of Vienna's Old City, just across the
Schwarzenbergplatz from the <i>Musikverein</i>, the home of the Vienna
Philharmonic, and a short walk from the famous Vienna Conservatory
of Music.

<p>
Such proximity means that conductors like Zubin Mehta and Claudio Abbado
can drop in to look at manuscripts of works they plan to conduct. The
Center immediately began a round of concerts, symposia, and special
events, and now sponsors fellowships, internships, and courses, as well
as a state-of-the-art website and computer projects whereby rare and
precious manuscripts are being digitized. The composer's own house on
the outskirts of Vienna in M&ouml;dling has also been reopened with a
permanent exhibition and lecture series.

<p>
After the difficulties the Schoenberg heirs experienced in Los Angeles,
they are evidently delighted with the new facility. Their negotiations
with the Austrian government, for example, included a private audience
with the Chancellor. Again, this would be unimaginable, not only in
the United States, but in most other nations, even small ones like
Austria. Nevertheless, I remain slightly skeptical. For however inspiring
it is to witness government sponsorship of a facility like the Schoenberg
Center, I can never quite forget that the Palais Fanto is just minutes
from the Rathaus, at whose sessions

<b></b>

of parliament J&ouml;rg Haider's neofascist Freedom Party has, at this
writing, sizable representation. And I recall that Ingeborg Bachmann,
who was born into a proto-Nazi family in Klagenfurt in 1926, remarked
frequently on the euphemism "the seven years" (<i>die Sieben Jahre</i>)as
a designator for World War II&#8212;a war in whose aftermath, Austria,
as an "occupied" country, escaped both the denazification campaign
undergone by Germany, and the Iron Curtain, which swallowed up all its
Eastern neighbors, including Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

<p>
Then, too, there is a personal irony for me in the idea that the new
Schoenberg Center should be housed in the Palais Fanto, to which I
have family ties. The Center website has this to say about the Palais's
original owner:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
David Fanto began his career as an apprentice for a paper shop in
Vienna. As a successful businessman he later bought oil fields in Galicia,
Rumania, and Poland. He founded one of the first Austrian refineries
in Pardubitz and participated in oil-drilling concerns in the Near
East. During the war years there was a sharp recession for the mineral
oil business.

<b></b>

In 1916 David Fanto bought Pottenbrunn Castle near St. P&ouml;lten. In
1917 he built the city palace (named after him) at Schwarzenbergplatz
6. After the war he was active in Czechoslovakia on behalf of the
restoration of the monarchy. David Fanto died in 1922. He left behind
two daughters, and a son, Richard Fanto, who inherited Pottenbrunn Castle.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Richard Fanto may have been the heir to his father's oil millions, but
his fate points to a very different side of Viennese <i>Kultur</i>. As a
wealthy young man, Richard Fanto had one consuming desire: to become
a professional cavalry officer in the most elite and exclusive of
regiments: Kaiser Franz Josef's own Yellow Dragoons. As my cousin Herbert
Sch&uuml;ller tells it in his unpublished family memoir, written in
English in 1995, Yellow Dragoons "wore red trousers, blue tunics with
yellow epaulettes . . . over which they had a shiny metal cuirass, or
breastplate, and a strangely curved helmet." For a young man of Jewish
descent, even a baptized and practicing Catholic as was Richard Fanto,
to become a member of the Yellow Dragoons was all but impossible. But
David Fanto brought it off by arranging a marriage between his son and
the daughter of an impoverished field marshall, Baron Horsetzski. After
World War I, the Fanto fortune collapsed as did Richard's marriage, and
this once elegant dragoon, a brilliant horseman who had won countless
trophies, spent his days trying to manage his meager funds and playing
cards at the Jockey Club. His daughter Ina, who had been brought up in
a convent, was to become an ardent Nazi&#8212;a high official in the
<i>Bund Deutscher M&auml;dchen</i>.

<p>
Meanwhile David Fanto's younger daughter Lili, married to my
grandfather Richard Sch&uuml;ller's brother Hugo, a physician, had
a very different fate. A talented artist, whose 1908 painting of my
mother (at age four) hangs in my dining room today (<a name="2"
HREF="10.2perloff_res.html#2"> 2</a>), she spent the early
years of her marriage shuttling back and forth between Vienna and her
Paris studio.

<b></b>
<p>



Her sons Herbert and George were brought up almost entirely by
governesses. The outbreak of the war changed everything: Paris was
now out of bounds, and the forty-year-old Hugo was soon called to
military service, physicians being in short supply. Alone in Vienna,
Lili began an affair with a man named Herman Blau, who happened to be
married to Grandmama Erna Sch&uuml;ller's sister Hedi, thus putting my
grandmother between sister and sister-in-law. The double divorce that
split both families was naturally a great scandal. I can still remember
hearing, as a young girl, the story of the bitter 1918 court case,
when Lili Fanto Sch&uuml;ller, asked why she wanted to divorce Hugo,
replied that he was not very good in bed. Grandfather Sch&uuml;ller,
by then a leading government official, was so angry at this "vulgar"
comment that he evidently didn't speak to anyone for a whole day,
and, given the circumstances, Uncle Hugo won custody of both of his
sons. But the loss of the Fanto fortune and marriage to the much less
elegant and more transparently Jewish Herman Blau (even though he
changed his name to the more neutral Berndt upon marriage), led to
a series of business disasters. When the two escaped Hitler in 1939,
the fifty-six-year-old Lili became a seamstress in a garment factory in
Elmhurst, Long Island. For the next fifteen years or so she sewed belts
on the assembly line, while her husband Herman worked as a shipping
clerk. She lived to be 101, maintained, in large part, by the two sons,
Herbert and George, she had treated so cavalierly in their childhood. I
remember meeting her once at George's house in Washington in the 1960s:
she was very much the grande dame in black dress and pearls, even as
her brother Richard continued till he died to play the cavalry officer
and boast of his one-time acquaintance with the Hapsburgs.

<p>
So it seems strange to me to think that the Palais Fanto is now a
center for avant-garde music and home to the estate of one of the
greatest composers of the century, whose own later years were spent
in difficult exile in Los Angeles. And yet Vienna's acquisition
and promotion of the Schoenberg oeuvre, now known around the world,
has oddly spurred on the Angeleno musical establishment to take a new
look at the composer's work. A decade after USC gave up the Schoenberg
archive and UCLA crassly sold the naming rights for Schoenberg Hall to a
pop music executive, Los Angeles concert groups organized an elaborate
"Schoenberg Prism" (2001-02)&#8212;a six-month festival of concerts,
lectures, symposia&#8212;that succeeded in bringing the composer full
circle to his adopted home, even as the composer's name, in response to
a wave of protests from the UCLA faculty, was restored to Schoenberg Hall.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 As is so often the case in American cultural and artistic life, it
 was the "foreign" imprimatur that made the difference.

<p>
The current absorption in the Viennese arts is hardly limited to
music. In the summer of 2002, for example, as unlikely a spot as the
Berkshires in Western Massachusetts featured a five-museum event called
the Vienna Project: "Gustav Klimt Landscapes" (with side exhibits on the
architecture of Joseph Hoffmann and Otto Wagner, and one on the "Homes
of Wittgenstein") at the Clark Institute in Williamstown, "Prelude to a
Nightmare: Art, Politics and Hitler's Early Years in Vienna, 1906-13"
at the Williams College Museum of Art, "Uncommon Denominator: New Art
from Vienna" at MASS MoCA in North Adams, "Secession Graphic Art" at
the Berkshire Museum

<b></b>

in Pittsfield, and an exhibition of Lisbeth Zwerger's illustrations for
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i> at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge.

<p>
Why Vienna in Williamstown? In Pittsfield, Stockbridge, and North
Adams? The <i>New York Times</i> speculated that it is precisely the
paradox of Vienna that once again fascinates us.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 On the one hand, there is Vienna, the great imperial city, with its
 opulent, gorgeous, erotic painting and design; on the other, Hitler's
 Vienna (the title of Brigitte Hamann's book on which the Williams
 College Museum show is based),
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 whose housing was so substandard that young men, arriving to seek their
 fortune in the capital, often ended up, as did Hitler, in bedbug-ridden
 shelters that were breeding-grounds for violence and political
 upheaval. A second&#8212;more specifically artistic&#8212;tension
 is that between the curves, spirals, and heavy ornamentation of
 the Secession versus the austere modernism of the "Kundmanngasse,"
 the house Wittgenstein designed for his sister Margarete, in keeping
 with the verbal "purity" of the <i>Tractatus.</i> How does the second
 emerge from the first? Is it a case of continuity or reaction?

<p>
I wondered about these relationships on a recent trip to New York when
I had a chance to visit two new institutions that represent the tension
between fin de si&egrave;cle and high-tech Vienna. The former, the Neue
Galerie, is located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Eighty-sixth Street,
just three blocks below Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim and four above the
Metropolitan. Its home is a lavishly restored Beaux-Arts mansion (1912-14;
see <a name="3" href="10.2perloff_res.html#3"> 3</a>)
designed by Carrere and Hastings, the architects of the New York Public
Library. Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt III once lived here, but ironically the
building more recently belonged to YIVO, an organization devoted to the
study of Yiddish culture. The Neue Galerie itself was the brainchild of
the art dealer Serge Sabarsky, a refugee from the Nazis who had settled
in New York and opened a gallery on Madison Avenue, and the collector
Ronald S. Lauder, an heir to the Est&eacute;e Lauder cosmetic fortune. In
1957, Lauder had evidently used his bar mitzvah money to buy his first
drawing by Egon Schiele. A decade later, he met Sabarsky and together,
the two gradually assembled a superb collection of Schieles, Gustav
Klimts, and Oskar Kokoschkas, as well as exquisite Viennese furniture
and decorative art by Joseph Hoffmann, Otto Wagner, and Adolf Loos,
along with a fine&#8212;but less unusual&#8212;collection of German
Expressionist art. In 1986, after a stint at the Pentagon, Lauder was
named U.S. Ambassador to Austria and during his stay in Vienna, where
he was joined by Sabarsky, the collection took its final shape.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
Ascending the Grand Staircase and wandering through the beautiful
high-ceilinged rooms with their arresting Klimt portraits and the erotic
drawings of Schiele, I experienced a strange sensory overload. My parents'
generation had felt nothing but contempt for these artworks, dismissing
them as "decadent," not yet truly modern. But today, this self-consciously
decorative and opulent painting&#8212;especially the Klimt landscapes,
apparently composed with the help of the telescope and hence flattened out
to look oddly like Japanese screens&#8212;seems nothing if not up-to-date;
indeed, many of the new works at MASS MoCA can be traced to the work of
the pre-World War I era, produced, as that work was, in a moment when
Jewish culture played a major role in the Austrian arts as did the Czech,
Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, and Slav cultures

<b></b>

that animated the capital. The interdisciplinary connections of the
artworks in the Neue Galerie are also striking: the same ornament that
defines Secession furniture, china, and glassware is found in posters
and calling cards, opera programs and book covers.

<p>
On the lobby floor of the Neue Galerie, to the right of the entrance,
is the elegant Caf&eacute; Sabarsky. This brilliantly designed restaurant
alludes slyly and subtly to fin de si&egrave;cle Vienna without pretending
to replicate the real thing. Here is a description by a restaurant
reviewer named Janet Forman:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Run by Kurt Gutenbrunner, chef at New York's sophisticated Austrian
restaurant Walls&eacute;, the caf&eacute; is rife with sumptuous
details such as marble tables and reproductions of Adolph Loos's 1899
black-bent-wood chairs&#8212;on sale in the design shop for $900 each.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The menu reinvents such Viennese classics as open-face Trzesniewksi-style
sandwiches, <i>matjes</i> herring with egg and apple, chestnut soup
and cod strudel with Riesling <i>sauerkraut</i>. . . . Slide across a
banquette covered in extravagant 1912 floral textile overlooking the
most fashionable part of Fifth Avenue, place a voluptuous $6 Sacher
torte to your lips, and for an hour you can be the vamp Sally Bowles
or an enigmatic expressionist painter in libertine Berlin of the Golden
Twenties.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Note the slippage in which early modernist Vienna is equated with Weimar
Germany as seen through the lens of Christopher Isherwood. But it doesn't
really matter in the

<b></b>

case of this elegant stage set, which has, of course, little to do with
the historic caf&eacute;s of Vienna&#8212;the Griensteidl (<a name="4"
HREF="10.2perloff_res.html#4"> 4</a>), the Landtmann, the
Herrenhof, the Central&#8212;frequented daily by such important persons as
Freud and Alfred Adler, Hugo Hoffmansthal and Robert Musil, Karl Krauss
and Leon Trotsky. Note that, as the painting of the Griensteidl makes
clear, the turn-of-the-century Vienna caf&eacute; was a male enclave. For
its patrons, it was primarily a refuge from the unheated, hopelessly dingy
flats and furnished rooms where many of them lived due to Vienna's acute
housing shortage. One drank coffee (always served with a glass of water),
read the papers, played cards and chess, and chatted with friends.

<p>
The Caf&eacute; Sabarsky is thus largely simulation. Ours is not the
world of Arthur Schnitzler's <i>Der Weg ins Freie</i> (The Road into
the Open), that troubling saga of an anti-Semitic society in which the
aristocratic hero Georg von Wergethin repairs, night after night, to
his favorite caf&eacute;, where he engages his Jewish alter ego Heinrich
Bermann in discussions about art, philosophy, and culture.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 The Caf&eacute; Sabarsky caters, not to regulars whom the waiters know
 by name, but to tourists, art professionals, and a good number of
 Ladies Who Lunch&#8212;a clientele that must often wait on line for
 the better part of an hour to gain entrance. Authentic? When I once
 asked my mother and her sister Susi whether they used to frequent the
 <i>Kaffeehaus</i>, they became quite indignant. Never, they insisted,
 did they set foot in a caf&eacute;! They had better things to do
 with their time. What they really meant is that the few women who did
 frequent the caf&eacute;s were not the

<b></b>

right sort. Ladies from <i>einer guten Familie</i> ("a good family")were
not seen there. They preferred the <i>Konditorei</i> or pastry
shop&#8212;for example, Demel's or Sluka's&#8212;which, unlike the
caf&eacute;, was designed for ladies as well as gentlemen and served
gorgeous finger sandwiches and cakes. But the fact is that my mother
and aunts barely went to the Konditorei either: they were too busy with
their studies or household routine.

<p>
And there are other anomalies. Around the time that I was reading in the
papers about the elegant Adolf Loos chairs in the Caf&eacute; Sabarsky, I
came across Tina Walzer and Stephan Templ's <i>Unser Wien: "Ariesierung"
auf Oesterreichisch</i> (Our Vienna: "Aryanization" Austrian Style),
a minutely documented study of the appropriation of Viennese Jewish
property&#8212;whether businesses, hotels, art galleries, cinemas,
architectural monuments, museums, book shops, or cafes&#8212;by the
Nazis in the spring and summer of 1938.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 As their catalog "Topography of Theft" makes clear, the bulk of
 this property has remained in the hands of the appropriators (or
 their clients), and there has never been a true restitution to the
 dispossessed and their heirs. For each important caf&eacute;, for
 example, the authors list the original owner(s), the appropriator(s),
 and the caf&eacute;'s later fate. Thus Bela Waldmann and Marcus Klug,
 the owners of the Caf&eacute; Herrenhof (frequented by writers
 like Max Brod and Franz Werfel), were imprisoned the day of the
 <i>Anschluss</i> and the caf&eacute; became state property (<A
 NAME="5" href="10.2perloff_res.html#5"> 5</a>).

<b></b>

<p>



The Graben-Caf&eacute;, designed by Josef Hoffmann in 1928 and owned by
Hugo F&uuml;rst, was torn down. And the Caf&eacute; Raimund, across the
street from the <i>Volkstheater</i> and hence a rendezvous for directors
and actors, lost its most illustrious clientele when the Nazis pursued
such directors as Rudolf Beer and Egon Friedell, both of whom committed
suicide within weeks of the <i>Anschluss</i>.

<p>
Reading Walzer and Templ's grim catalogue of theft, I found myself,
perversely, all the more curious about the romanticcaf&eacute; cultureof
imperial Vienna. Nostalgia, the longing for a past that has never quite
existed, with its concomitant feelings of loss and displacement, is,
as Svetlana Boym has argued so tellingly in her book on the subject,
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 the inevitable by-product of exile. On a sunny Saturday, when
 my husband and I finally dined at the Caf&eacute; Sabarsky, the
 experience surpassed all expectations. One taste of the pea soup,
 bright green and sweet, with little bits of lobster floating on top,
 triggered a Proustian recollection: just such pea soup had been served
 at H&ouml;rlgasse 6, where I lived for the first six and a half years
 of my life. Again, the <i>Matjes</i> herring topped with thin slices
 of apple and red onion struck me as delicious beyond words, recalling
 summer vacations in the mountains of Seefeld. And the <i>Sachertorte</i>
 and <i>Dobostorte</i> which we sampled tasted precisely like the ones
 our cook Kati had made in Vienna. Seated at a little marble-top table
 on the Adolf Loos reproduction chair (replicas are for sale in the
 Design Shop) and sipping, first Schlumberger Cuv&eacute;e Klimt and
 then a m&eacute;lange, I was totally happy. Yet&#8212;and here is
 another irony&#8212;I have been back to Vienna four times during my
 adulthood and have never had a meal nearly as good in Vienna itself. But
 then service in Vienna today is a far cry from that of Schnitzler's
 Vienna. It tends to be brusque and rude, the dishes served by surly
 waiters (one immediately wonders if they are anti-Semitic), whereas
 the Caf&eacute; Sabarsky is all smiles, all around.

<p>
A visit to the Neue Galerie is thus a classic nostalgia trip. But the
Austrian government itself is aware of the need to go beyond the image
of early modernist Vienna, however beautiful and opulent its art work
and design. Indeed, in April 2002 a very different institution opened
its doors&#8212;this time on East Fifty-second Street between Fifth
and Madison Avenues&#8212;namely the Austrian Cultural Forum. This
astonishing structure of concrete, glass, and steel (<a name="6"
HREF="10.2perloff_res.html#6"> 6</a>) was designed by the
Austrian architect Raimund Abraham, who has lived in New York since the
early 1970s.

<p>
The Forum's brochure describes the building this way:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The body of the Forum tower tapers as it rises, complying with zoning
laws in levels that alternately step and slope. Glazed with dramatic
glass panels that seem to be in a state of constant suspension, the
forceful but mysterious image of the building has elicited comparisons
to dagger blades and guillotines, thermometers and metronomes, Easter
Island totems and pyramids of a future not yet imagined. The structure
consists of what Abraham has dubbed "three elementary towers" defined
by the extreme conditions of a site only 25 feet wide and 81 feet deep:
the Vertebra is the stair tower at the back of the site; the Core is
the central structural tower containing the Forum's functioning spaces
within a meticulously constructed, interrelated arrangement, and the
mask is the glass articulation of the street fa&ccedil;ade, punctuated
by a protruding, box-like volume that in fact accommodates an interior
program area with spectacular views.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>



The website for the Forum is itself a work of art: flash-art images
of the towers and their skylights, seen from both inside and outside,
in shades of white, gray, and black are intersected by aphorisms
taken from the writings of Freud or the avant-garde poet Ernst
Jandl, and abstract geometric forms&#8212;primarily black squares and
rectangles&#8212;traverse the field vertically while John Cagean sounds
are played continuously. On the left, a series of tiny parallel lines
(evidently modeled on the compressed floors) move vertically toward the
top of the screen where they intersect. When clicked, these lines

<b></b>

give way to words, providing information about the Forum's
activities&#8212;its calendar of avant-garde concerts, performances
of digital art and music, lectures, poetry readings&#8212;as well as a
display of the different floors and their role in the building.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
It is a state-of-the-art digital performance that provides a feast for
the eye and ear&#8212;the dream, perhaps, of a new Vienna for the New
Artist. But again it isn't that simple. For Abraham, born to a Catholic
family in the small Tyrolean town of Lienz in 1933 and growing up to the
sight and sound of the "iron sky" covered with airplanes dropping bombs,
the notion of death is never far away. In a November 2001 interview
reproduced on the website, he cites Adolf Loos's aphorism, "When you walk
through the woods and come upon a hole two feet wide, six feet long, and
six feet deep, you know that is architecture." "Death," he remarks, "has
to work, it must express itself and its meaning somehow just as do hope or
desire. Maybe it's a problem of a technocized, urban society that death
becomes very much removed from our lives. I grew up in a small town in
Austria where there were funerals all the time. It was part of life." For
that very reason, monuments, Abraham believes, don't work. "Think about
the fact that no Holocaust memorial ever succeeds in the end because no
monument can ever be more monumental than a concentration camp. . . . No
building can match the terrifying empty spaces of these original sites."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
Not long after Abraham gave this interview, he renounced his Austrian
citizenship to protest J&ouml;rg Haider's participation in the coalition
government. Here again, an image carefully created and polished to
remind the international world, and especially the United States, of the
great cultural heritage and relevance of tiny Austria and its capital,
is shadowed by the specter of a dark politics that never seems to quite
go away. By a curious coincidence, we remember, Fifty-second Street, now
graced by Abraham's brilliant fa&ccedil;ade, was also&#8212;this time,
west of Fifth Avenue&#8212;the site of W. H. Auden's famous war dirge,
"September 1, 1939":


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I sit in one of the dives
<br />
On Fifty-second Street
<br />
Uncertain and afraid
<br />
As the clever hopes expire
<br />
Of a low dishonest decade. . . .
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps we can read the Forum's "masked" tower structure as a kind
of unmasking of those "low dishonest decades" of midcentury. The
soaring glass fa&ccedil;ade prompts the viewer to pay homage to an
Austria-in-Manhattan that might mark a new turn.

<p>
Or at least I would like to see it that way. But in 1944, when I changed
my name from Gabriele (already Anglicized&#8212;or more accurately modeled
on the French form&#8212;by the addition of an <i>l</i>) to Marjorie,
as part of the process of becoming a U.S. citizen, I was wholly unaware
of such cultural niceties. I was a thirteen-year-old eighth grader, who
yearned only to be as American as possible. In my class at the Fieldston
School, which I had just entered on a full scholarship after seven years
of public school in the Bronx, the most popular girl was named Margie;
she also happened to be assigned to be my Big Sister in the new school. I
so much wanted to be like this Margie that I still

<b></b>

make my capital <i>M'</i>s oversize and round like her
"progressive-school" script. I disliked <i>Gabrielle</i> because
classmates and campmates always called me Gabby, a name, I'm afraid,
all too appropriate, as those who know me can attest. Then, too, a
<i>gaby</i> is defined in the dictionary as meaning "fool" or "idiot":
the word is now obsolete but one can find it in Victorian novels in
locutions like "Don't be such a gaby!" As for the name Gabrielle,
the children at my Bronx elementary school had been given to shouting,
"<i>Gayyy-briel,</i>blow your horn!"

<p>
Accordingly, when we took out our citizenship papers, I asked to become
Marjorie, Margie for short. I am surprised that my parents consented,
since they were quite strict and quite insistent on my retaining the
German language and reading German literature, but they did. And so
I took on the name then linked to Herman Wouk's Marjorie Morningstar
and to sitcom characters named Marge. After I turned forty, I found it
inappropriate to be called Margie, as in <i>My Little Margie</i>, and so,
around the time when we moved from Washington to Philadelphia in 1972,
I became Marjorie once and for all. I can now divide my friends into those
I've known long enough to be Margie and those for whom I am Marjorie. But
when I see the name in print even now, together with the name Perloff,
which is not my name but my husband's, there is always a moment where
I wonder who Marjorie Perloff is. It just doesn't look or sound like me.

When Charles Bernstein found out about my "real" name he wrote the
following poem:

</blockquote>

<p>
What does it all mean? Ludwig (Wittgenstein) and Gertrude (Stein) make a
seemingly odd couple, but, as I suggest in <i>Wittgenstein's Ladder</i>
and as Charles has noted in

<b></b>

<i>Content's Dream</i> and <i>My Way</i>, they share a concern for
the strangeness of ordinary language, an awareness that the slightest
syntactic shift or the replacement of a single word in a sentence can
change meaning radically.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Then too, both Ludwig and Gertrude were nonpracticing, secularized Jews
 (although Wittgenstein was baptized a Catholic at birth), assimilated
 enough to call into question particular Jewish practices. Both were
 homosexual and chose exile&#8212;he in Cambridge, she in Paris&#8212;at
 least in part so as to avoid scrutiny of their private lives. Both,
 moreover, received in their lifetime "plenty o' flack" (line 19) for
 their radical ideas and seemingly "non-sensical" writings. Theirs,
 like Schoenberg's, was a "notorious novelty" (line 6), one that took
 decades to understand and assimilate.

<p>
It thus makes sense for Gertrude and Ludwig to share an "adventure." But
the "bogus adventure" to which the poem alludes in the first few lines
was obscure to me until Charles himself explained that he had in mind a
Pete Hewitt film called <i>Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey</i> ,
in which the two boy heroes have to battle with cyborg versions of
themselves, created by an evil spirit who wants to destroy their heavy
metal band. In the course of their adventure, Bill and Ted undergo
terrible ordeals but because, as the film's predecessor, <i>Bill &amp;
Ted's Excellent Adventure,</i> details, the two boys know the secret of
the universe ("Be excellent to each other"), they are rewarded in the
end by being turned into "good" Bill and Ted robots who conquer their
evil twins and win the Battle of the Bands.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
I confess that I wouldn't have known these plots had I not looked them up
with my favorite internet search engine Google and then watched a rerun
or two on the cable channels. Science-fiction-film adventure stories
that deal with Martians, cyborgs, and heavy metal are not exactly part
of my discourse radius. And that, of course, probably gave Charles
his rationale. Billy's "bogus adventure" in which the "balloons /
Get marooned on the other side of the / Lunar landscape" immediately
introduces the idea of borders to cross&#8212;and in a "module" that's
"broke" to boot. Everything in this landscape seems out of kilter:
"Sally's joined the Moonies," "the strings are broken on the guitar,"
and although "the sachertorte tasted sweet," "the memory / burned in
the colon"&#8212;an allusion to the lines in John Ashbery's "'They Dream
Only of America,'" "This honey is delicious / though it burns the throat."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 The poem moves from the American pop culture of the sci-fi opening
 and the well-known 1950s ad for Chase &amp; Sanborn coffee ("The
 morning cup will keep that grippe away!") to Vienna, "cold at that
 time of year" (an allusion to the early March weather at the time of
 the <i>Anschluss</i>), and then into a kind of sinister dreamscape,
 in which coffee dissolves in waves of "sand," and the preventable
 grippe modulates into "Get a grip, get a grip, before / The Grippe
 gets you." And then the transformation of "picture" into "pitcher"
 and the "pitcher that pours" into the baseball pitcher, "Throwing the
 Ball, with never a catcher in sight," gives us a premonition of a dark
 future. Even the nursery-rhyme rhythms of the conclusion&#8212;"Never
 a catcher but sometimes a catch, or / A clinch or a clutch or a
 spoon"&#8212;are jarring, leading up, as they do, not to the cow
 jumping over the moon, as one might anticipate, but to what will be
 "plenty o' flack, 'till we meet / On this side of the tune."

<b></b>

<p>
Which side is that? "Gertrude and Ludwig's Bogus Adventure" was
prompted in part by a conversation I had with Charles about my escape,
with my family, from Vienna on the day after the <i>Anschluss</i>
(March 12, 1938). The adventure of Gabriele Mintz, his poem suggests
obliquely&#8212;an adventure that takes Gabriele from the Vienna of
Wittgenstein to the America of Gertrude Stein, had its own "bogus"
dimensions with respect to the pretensions and impersonations of the
cultural milieu in which it was rooted. Indeed, Charles's poem captures
the curious tension that has characterized my own "adventure," which took
me as a small child from the Vienna of <i>Sachertorte</i> and <i>Kaffee
mit Schlag</i> to an America of Chase &amp; Sanborn coffee, Pete Hewitt
adventure films, Moonies, and baseball&#8212;all those trappings of
Americana that my family dismissed as so much lowbrow entertainment for
the untutored masses.

<p>
But, in a further twist, the poem undercuts this image as well. Is the
perception of America as the land of pop and <i>schlock</i> accurate? In
that case, why does the "Bogus Adventure" also encompass the very
different America of a poet strongly influenced by Stein&#8212;namely,
Frank O'Hara, to whose "Memorial Day 1950" (written when O'Hara was only
twenty-four) Charles alludes obliquely in lines 8-10. In this elegiac
poem, which pays homage to Stein and Picasso, Apollinaire, and Rimbaud,
"collages or sprechstimme," O'Hara recalls his alienation from his
parents in the following surreal sequence:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Wasted child! I'll club you on the shins. I
<br />
wasn't surprised when the older people entered
<br />
my cheap hotel room and broke my guitar and my can
<br />
of blue paint.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, in a later turn toward artistic vocation, the poet says, "Look
at my room / Guitar strings hold up pictures. I don't need / a piano
to sing." Just so, we read in Charles's poem, "when / The strings are
broken on the guitar / You can always use it as a coffee table."

<p>
The pragmatism of this "solution" is very congenial to me. "Love," we read
in "Memorial Day 1950," "is first of all / a lesson in utility." But
becoming Marjorie was a complicated process, given that, for my
family, the new American world was indeed "the other side of the lunar
landscape." And the "adventure" I underwent is in one sense "bogus," in
that memory has transformed so much of what "happened" that there is now
no way to recover the "real" past. But, like many &eacute;migr&eacute;s,
I remain fascinated by the cultural, social, and artistic legacy of that
modernist Vienna, so much of whose energy seems to have been expended on
the desire to downplay the Jewish presence that had, ironically, done
so much to make Viennese culture the richly textured, complicated, and
supersubtle culture it was. Indeed, the <i>Kulturdrang</i>, especially
of the interwar years, seems to have gone hand in hand with a collective
desire for <i>passing</i>&#8212;passing as someone or something one
could never quite be&#8212;a desire that tragically ended only with the
acknowledgment of the Holocaust.

<p>
Or has it in fact ended? Even now, as we learn in the Neue Galerie,
nostalgia can be powerful. The <i>Sachertorte</i> was sweet . . .

I. Introduction
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In his opening speech at the second Zionist Congress in Basel on August
28, 1898, Max Nordau invented one of German Zionism's most famous,
most fraught, and most challenging concepts: the "muscle Jew."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Although Nordau did not start exploring the political implications
 of his initial call for a "muscle Jewry" until a couple of years
 later, he clearly alluded, in this early speech, to the necessity
 of creating a new type of Jew&#8212;corporeally strong, sexually
 potent, and morally fit&#8212;as the precondition for realizing
 the national goals of Zionism. After providing an overview of the
 steadily deteriorating situation of Jews in Russia, Romania, and
 Galicia&#8212;what he terms "the classic countries of Jewish suffering"
 (<i>SP,</i> 2:15)&#8212;Nordau turns to France and suggests that the
 widespread anti-Semitism that sparked the Dreyfus Affair was also a
 fatal affront to the Enlightenment ideal of universally recognized
 human rights. He argues that the Jews themselves must change their
 desperate historical situation, and that it is "Zionism [that will]
 awaken Judaism to new life." He continues, "It achieves this morally
 [<i>sittlich</i>] through the rejuvenation of the ideals of the
 <i>Volk</i> and corporeally [<i>k&ouml;rperlich</i>] through the
 physical rearing of one's offspring, in order to create a lost muscle
 Jewry [<i>Muskeljudenthum</i>] once again" (<i>SP,</i> 2:24).

<p>
Nordau's idea of a muscle Jewry was not only consistent with the national
goals of the Zionist movement: simultaneously the spiritual and the
corporeal rebirth of the Jewish people, as articulated by Theodor Herzl
and other early Zionist proponents;
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<b></b>

it was also the crystallization of these goals on the individual
body of the Jew. National regeneration would come through moral and
physical rebirth and, recursively, moral and physical regeneration
would be achieved though nationality. Indeed, the concept of the muscle
Jew resonated immediately because it brought mythic elements of the
Jewish tradition to bear upon the turbulent historical reality of fin
de si&egrave;cle Europe, marked by both a raging political uncertainty
and a condensation of conflicting intellectual currents ranging from
decadence to social Darwinism.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Nordau called upon both a great Jewish past and a redeemed future,
 a convergence that would give the fledgling Zionist movement its
 present direction and historical rationale. Contrary to contemporary
 anti-Semitic representations of Jews as scrawny, weak, and inferior
 (an image also internalized by many Jews through the violent mechanisms
 of self-hatred), Jews were at one time, Nordau reminded his readership,
 muscular and heroic, as the mythic story of Bar Kochba attested.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Not by chance, "Bar Kochba" and the "Maccabees" also became two of the
 names adopted by the newly formed Zionist gymnastic associations. In
 fact, Nordau would publish the first complete expression of his call for
 "Muscle Jewry" in an article in the second issue of <i>Die J&uuml;dische
 Turnzeitung</i> (The Jewish gymnastics journal), the central organ
 of the "Bar Kochba" Gymnastics Association and a key venue for the
 dissemination of German Zionism up through the end of World War I.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 In this decisive article, he describes Bar Kochba as "the last
 world-historical embodiment of a war-hardened, weapon-happy Judaism"
 as well as "a hero who refused to know defeat" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900,
 no. 2:10).

<p>
Over the formative and tumultuous two decades between 1898 and the end of
World War I, Nordau's reinvented muscle Jew would become one of the most
emblematic res of German Zionism's "body culture." Iterations of the
muscle Jew would appear in a fascinatingly wide range of discourses on
corporeal regeneration, which simultaneously addressed the reformation
of the individual body and the reconstruction of the body politic of
the desired nation. Beyond Nordau and the pages of <i>Die J&uuml;dische
Turnzeitung</i>, these intersecting Zionist discourses extended from
the aesthetic and the therapeutic to the eugenic and the colonial. In
the visual arts, for example, the iconography of E. M. Lilien, the most
important and prolific Zionist artist of the early twentieth century,
is inseparable from the "Hellenic" athletes that inspired Nordau's
competitive muscle Jew; in medicine and eugenics, the muscle Jew
represents a radically hygienic and racially charged counterimage to the
"degeneracy" of the <i>Ostjude;</i> and in Zionist colonial discourses,
the strength of the muscle Jew is the prerequisite for successfully
building a nation in Palestine. What these seemingly diffuse discourses
share is a national investment in the images and rhetoric of regeneracy.

<p>
To illustrate this convergence of discourses, let me begin by
drawing attention to two overdetermined images produced during
the first decade of Zionism. The first image (<a name="1"
HREF="10.2presner_res.html#1"> 1</a>), produced and printed
in Berlin in 1904, is an illustration by E. M. Lilien for the first
edition of the journal <i>Altneuland</i> (Old-new land). The second
(<a name="2" href="10.2presner_res.html#2"> 2</a>),
"Auswanderung nach Pal&auml;stina" (Emigration to Palestine), was
published around the same time in the anti-Semitic slapstick journal,
<i>Kikeriki,</i> based in Vienna.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Both images, which can be read productively in dialogue with one
 another, depict Jews migrating

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 272]</b>

to Palestine. In Lilien's illustration, we see two muscle Jews, rendered
as gigantic Hellenic athletes, carrying an even larger bounty of grapes
to the Promised Land. The two Jews walk barefoot across the top of the
earth, which is itself shaped by the rounded word <i>Altneuland</i> and
gently accented by blades of protruding grass. Their muscular res are
silhouetted in front of two spheres, outlining the earth and probably
the rising sun. In the caricature from <i>Kikeriki,</i> we see a band
of seven Jews crammed together front-to-back holding a crudely carved,
pointed spear labeled "Zionismus." The grotesquely distorted Jews have
bodies marked by exaggerated "Jewish" features including small statures,
large noses, and bulky feet.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Their ugly countenances emerge directly from the anti-Semitic
 imagination: The first and third Jews display profiles of vapid
 eagerness; the second Jew appears conniving and mischievous;
 the fourth and fifth seem learned but petty; the sixth looks
 wide-eyed and greedy; the last bespectacled Jew has a countenance
 of unspeakable haughtiness. This motley crew wends its way through
 a dense forest&#8212;populated by preying vultures, giant insects,
 and exotic foliage&#8212;on its way to Palestine.

<p>
Lilien's illustration was published at the height of his popularity
as the foremost artist of Zionism, and the drawing shares a stylistic
resemblance to other pictures that he created for the Zionist cause
during this period.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Although he had produced many prior images of Jews with bulging muscles
 (see <a name="3" href="10.2presner_res.html#3"> 3</a>),
 this illustration was unique in bringing the masculinity of Hellenism
 together with the Zionist national project. Except for a wreath of
 leaves in his hair, the first bearded man stands naked, his clenched
 fists and taut muscles exhibiting a sculpted male beauty; the second,
 wrapped in a partly diaphanous cloth, is slightly taller, younger,
 and more muscular. In contrast to the seven dwarflike Jews in the
 <i>Kikeriki</i> illustration,
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 the two men do not touch each other and are, instead, separated by a
 magnificent abundance of grapes. The bundle of grapes signifies the
 fertility of the land, perhaps standing in for a woman. The phallic
 rod that runs the length of the illustration not only gives an element
 of depth to the image through its diagonal placement on the two Jews'
 opposing shoulders; it also highlights and penetrates the feminine
 fertility of the lush bunch of grapes. Whereas Lilien deflects
 homosexual contact through a symbolic feminine presence necessary for
 nation building, the <i>Kikeriki</i> caricature depicts the seven male
 Jews in compromising postures holding a phallic spear that penetrates
 them all. Here, Zionism is to be interpreted as the foolish product
 of malformed, homosexual Jews.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
But perhaps even more relevant to the Zionist project of national
regeneration is the fact that both of these images link the individual
body of the Jew to the larger project of state formation. Lilien's muscle
Jews are in the process of relocating their reproductive fertility to
the "old-new land" of Palestine, and the Jews of the <i>Kikeriki</i>
caricature are viciously mocked as silly degenerates whimsically
attempting to found a state. Even if the latter survive the hostile
terrain populated by wild mushrooms, flocking vultures, and insects as
big as their noses, surely, we are made to believe, they could never
establish a state like the great European powers.

<p>
Giving a visual illustration of Houston Stewart Chamberlain's race-based
anti-Semitic argument in his magnum opus, <i>Foundations of the Nineteenth
Century,</i> the <i>Kikeriki</i> caricature shows Jews as anything but
"world-historical" people. Not only are present-day 

<b></b>

Jews racially unfit for nation building, but Jews have, according to
Chamberlain's version of history, always been so. In this vein, after
describing the physical, religious, and cultural deficiencies of the
Jews in his chapter "On the Entrance of the Jews into Western History,"
Chamberlain turns back to the history of the Judeans to show how Jews,
unlike Germans, have never been able to found a great nation:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
They were so unwarlike, such unreliable soldiers that their king had to
trust his protection and the protection of their land to foreign troops;
they were so unwilling to undertake any endeavors that just looking at
the ocean . . . horrified them; they were so slothful that for every
task at hand one had to hire designers, production managers, and even
handworkers from neighboring countries for all the delicate work; they
were so unfit for agriculture that (as it says in many places in the Bible
and the Talmud) the Canaanites were not just their teachers but were the
only ones up until the end who worked the land; yes, even in a purely
political respect, they were such opponents of all stable, well-ordered
conditions that no rational form of government could come about by them
and they felt best from early on under the pressure of foreign rule,
something that did not prevent them, however, from burrowing underneath
it. [<i>GNJ,</i> 1:454]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Through their scheming, their "materialistic worldview," and their
"demonic genius" (<i>GNJ,</i> 1:455), the Jews have, despite (or perhaps
because of) their laziness and other deficiencies, nevertheless managed
to survive as a race under the rule of other nations; however, they remain
nothing more than a "foreign element," Chamberlain argues, quoting Herder
with approbation (<i>GNJ,</i> 1:463). Because of these transhistorical
racial qualities, Jews can never know the greatness of having their
own nation. Even Zionism, because it, too, is always already "Jewish,"
is condemned to fail, as the <i>Kikeriki</i> caricature portrays in no
uncertain terms.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 By contrast, the Germans, Chamberlain maintains, building on Hegel's
 quadripartite structuring of history, represent the pinnacle of
 "world history" because their cultural and national strength is the
 outgrowth of the great colonial empires of Greece and Rome. That
 the little Jews are depicted sauntering along on foot&#8212;rather
 than traveling by ship&#8212;is thus highly significant. After all,
 reckoning with the ocean, traveling by ship, and cultivating the
 new land are world-historical achievements that, according to both
 Chamberlain and Hegel, assure a colonial claim to national greatness.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
Lilien's Hellenic depiction of two muscle Jews walking on top of the
earth with the bounty of fertility thus represents a very different
history of Judaism. The Jews here are great, as indicated by their sheer
scale, and quite capable of domesticating nature and cultivating the
land. But even more striking are the colonial tasks that the journal,
with Lilien's frontispiece, envisioned for itself. The title "Altneuland"
was a direct reference to Herzl's 1902 utopian travel novel of the same
name, in which Jews settle Palestine and transform it from a "desert
wasteland" into a vibrant, technologically modern nation-state.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Jews not only cultivate the soil, they arrive by ship&#8212;just as
 Herzl did in 1898 for his famous visit to Palestine with the German
 Kaiser&#8212;to civilize this supposedly backward land. "Jewish settlers
 who streamed into this country brought with them the experiences of
 the whole civilized world [i.e., Europe]," Herzl declares in his novel.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
While Herzl imagined the novel as taking place in 1923, some two decades
after it was written, the journal <i>Altneuland</i> was founded in 1904
(the year of Herzl's death) with the express purpose of investigating
the scientific and economic conditions for the Jewish colonization of
Palestine. As the frontispiece indicates, the journal was to serve "the
economic tapping of Palestine." The first edition laid out the tasks to
be accomplished:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We have to know the land precisely on which the house of Ahasver will
stand. . . . The journal shall collect and examine what those who
know the land best know about its climate, its soil, its fruits and
products, its laws and their operation, the customs of its inhabitants,
its health conditions . . . it will collect reports about agriculture,
business, and trade with all neighboring areas and countries with similar
natural resources and composition. . . . It shall collect and examine
what is well-known by all colonial enterprises [<i>kolonisatorische
Unternehmungen</i>] across the world. . . . Like a focal point, the
journal will bring together all of the thousands of scattered rays into
a single bundle of light in order to enlighten the half-darkened land of
two thousand years of desire, which is today only illuminated by shadows.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As the mission statement of the journal makes clear, one of the
critical prerequisites of the successful colonization of Palestine
was extensive scientific knowledge about the land, its inhabitants,
and their customs. Moreover, utilizing the rhetoric and metaphors of
the Enlightenment, the Jewish colonial effort would be consistent with
the European idea of colonization as the spread of "civilization," the
domestication of nature, and the dispensing of knowledge to those in the
shadowy darkness of the land. At the same time, as Lilien's frontispiece
shows, Palestine was not just to be scientifically studied and objectively
analyzed but also actively populated and civilized by muscle Jews
who were arriving from Europe&#8212;on foot and by ship&#8212;in the
"old-new land."

<p>
As I hope is already evident, then, Nordau's invention of the muscle Jew
cannot be adequately understood apart from the paradoxical condensation
of multiple discourses concerning the politics of regeneracy and the
deployment of sexuality for the purpose of nation formation. Strangely,
however, no study of the body culture of German Zionism has tried to
analyze comprehensively the discourses of the muscle Jew in this way. In
fact, when the muscle Jew is discussed, the concept is either largely
confined to Nordau's idiosyncratic intellectual biography or considered an
exemplary instance of anxieties over Jewish masculinity and nationality.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 In the latter camp, George Mosse undoubtedly produced the most
 substantial corpus of work dedicated to the exploration of the topos
 of masculinity within nineteenth- and twentieth-century European
 nationalisms.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 But what Mosse does not do&#8212;and this applies to all the studies I
 have encountered in which the concept is mentioned&#8212;is consider
 the muscle Jew as a discursive formation, one that both emerged from
 Nordau's aesthetic reflections on regeneration and lived on in a range
 of discourses that extended and justified the corporeal politics of
 German Zionism.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 In this article, I propose to do just that and pursue the more modest
 goal of examining the genesis of the muscle Jew discourse within
 Nordau's theories of regeneracy as well as the visual culture of <i>Die
 J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i>.

<p>
Critics are still somewhat split between those who view Nordau's Zionism
as a "sudden eruption" and those who see "no real division in his thought
between his Zionism and the world-view he outlined in his non-Zionist
and earlier writings."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 I want to argue here that Nordau's articulation of the muscle Jew
 is informed by the same logic of "education," "discipline," and
 "regeneration" found in the 1892 project of <i>Degeneration</i> and,
 therefore, that his Zionism&#8212;especially his conceptualization
 of the muscle Jew&#8212;is anything but a "sudden eruption." In what
 follows, then, I first give a reading of Nordau's <i>Degeneration,</i>
 taking seriously the terms of his analysis, in order to distill

<b></b>

the corporeal and aesthetic concepts that will later inform his
understanding of the tasks of Zionism. From there, I turn to a detailed
analysis of the first years of the muscle Jew discourse vis-&agrave;-vis
the project of <i>Degeneration.</i> What I want to show is that all the
traits that Nordau attributed to the "true modern" in 1892&#8212;health
and originality of race, clarity of vision and purpose, strength of body,
depth of discipline, and ability to adapt&#8212;have been transposed
to the muscle Jew and, more broadly, the discourse of the "new Jew"
featured in the pages of <i>DieJ&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i>.

II. Nordau's <i>Degeneration</i>
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In 1888, in his last completed work before his collapse in Turin,
Nietzsche emblematically summed up the anxieties of the late nineteenth
century with the following words: "Nothing is better known today,
at least nothing has been better studied, than the protean character
of degenerescence."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Through the re of Wagner, Nietzsche mounted a choleric critique
 of modernity and its voguish nihilism, arguing that decadence and
 degeneracy&#8212;ranging from cultural decline to physical sickness and
 moral turpitude&#8212;are the truest signs of this "nervous age." As
 Nietzsche suggests, signs of degeneracy were detected and studied
 everywhere, not just in cultural or artistic forms. The fast pace of
 modern life rendered the nerves of city dwellers weak;
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 the "natural" borders of races and classes had become porous, causing
 these groups to break down and merge together; the spread of venereal
 diseases and prostitution evidenced the loosening of codes for policing
 sexuality, while the eager embrace of the rhetoric of sickness and
 decadence displaced traditional moral authorities.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 But most of all, the birth of the discipline of eugenics in the
 mid-1850s
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 turned the regulation of degeneracy into an urgent racial-sexual
 imperative.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
It is precisely this confluence of discourses&#8212;medicinal,
socio-economic, political, and cultural&#8212;around the concept of
degeneracy that fed the apocalyptic tone of Nordau's fin de si&egrave;cle
cultural criticism. When <i>Degeneration</i> appeared in 1892, it was
an instant success, becoming one of the best selling and most hotly
contested books of the decade. Not one for understatement, Nordau
couched his shrill diagnosis in the following terms: "The feeling of
the time is curiously confused. . . . The prevailing sense is that of
destruction and extinction. . . . In our days there has awakened in the
minds of the more highly developed a dark fear of a dusk of nations
[<i>V&ouml;lkerd&auml;mmerung</i>] in which all the suns and stars
are gradually burning out and humankind with all its institutions and
creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Nordau's solution, while definitely motivated by a desire for the
 preservation of traditional, classical values and forms, does not
 look backward to reclaim a lost character but rather prognosticates
 an evolutionary break, imbued with the ideology of social Darwinism,
 in which the "degenerates" will perish and those who are strong,
 disciplined, and well-adapted will come forward to preside over a
 new world.

<p>
Condemning virtually every contemporary artistic or literary movement
as proof of "degeneracy" (his unforgiving criticism jumps effortlessly
from particular res such as Manet and Tolstoy to entire movements
like the pre-Raphaelites, Symbolism, and

<b></b>

"Ibsenism"), Nordau argues that only the calm rationality and disciplined
logic of scientific progress can save humanity from the woes of
degeneration and its attendant horror, formlessness. In his "portrait of
the most famous leader of the Symbolists," Verlaine, he writes, "We see
a repulsive degenerate with an asymmetric skull and a Mongolian face,
an impulsive vagabond and dipsomaniac, who, because of crimes against
morality, was placed in a penitentiary; . . . a dotard, who displays
the absence of any definite thought in his mind by incoherent speech,
meaningless expressions, and frizzy images" (<i>E,</i> 1:228). In other
words, degenerates can be recognized not only by the confused content
and chaotic structure of their thoughts or artistic expressions but also
by race-based, physical deformities (such as an "asymmetric skull" and
"Mongolian face") that prevent them from adapting to the demands of civil
society. Instead of engaging in productive labor, rational activities,
and deliberate moral decisions&#8212;the cornerstones of an enlightened
society&#8212;the degenerate is lost, desperate, overly emotional,
drunk, and sex-craved. Not given to restraint (although, ironically, he
considers restraint to be a critical characteristic of the healthy and
sane), Nordau spends the next three hundred pages of his book mercilessly
castigating an astonishingly wide range of artists, literati, critics,
and philosophers, as well as anyone else who dares to question the truths
of science and the rational foundations of civil society.

<p>
His chief concern is with the "contempt for traditional views of
respectability and morality" (<i>E,</i> 1:10).
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Established customs, old moral authorities, and traditional practices
 have, he argues, been glibly displaced by a "practical release from
 conventional discipline [<i>Zucht</i>]" (<i>E,</i> 1:10). "Discipline,"
 arguably the central term in Nordau's lexicon, had, at one time,
 insured the reliability of moral authorities, the stability of
 values, the containment of lewdness, the steadfastness of ideals
 in art, and the sublimation of base desires and greed, among other
 things. Historically, through the discipline of their form, artists,
 poets, and musicians taught us what is good, valuable, beautiful,
 enviable, and inspirational. But this is no longer the case at the
 fin de si&egrave;cle, which announces "the end of an order to the
 world that for thousands of years satisfied logic, fettered depravity,
 and in every art matured something of beauty" (<i>E,</i> 1:11). Forms
 have become blurred, boundaries upset, order forsaken, logic and values
 abandoned&#8212;all in favor of undisciplined chaos. The catchall term
 for this breakdown is <i>degeneracy</i>.

<p>
Nordau proclaims at the outset of the first chapter that, when we speak of
the fin de si&egrave;cle, we "ought correctly to say <i>fin de race</i>"
(<i>E,</i> 1:5; italics in original) since the current cultural situation
manifests not simply the end of a century, but also the degenerative end
of race. To understand his point, we might dwell briefly on the etymology
of <i>degeneration</i> (<i>Entartung</i>). The German verb <i>entarten</i>
('to degenerate') means <i>aus der Art schlagen</i>, approximately,
"to be untrue to form or kind [<i>Art</i>]." It implies a process of
withdrawal (<i>ent-arten</i>) or movement away from an ideal or, at
least, normative type. In English and French, the word <i>degenerate</i>
(from the Latin <i>degeneratus</i>) also contains the idea of a debased
movement away from a norm while implying the idea of a "natural" form,
namely a "race" or genus. Thus, to be degenerate means "to deviate from
one's race or kind."

<b></b>

<p>
To articulate his idea that degeneration is a "fin de race," Nordau
cites the seminal text of the French psychiatrist B&eacute;n&eacute;dict
Auguste Morel, <i>Trait&eacute; des d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rescences
physiques, intellectuelles et morales de l'esp&egrave;ce humaine et
des Causes qui produisent ces Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s maladives</i>
(1857 [Treaty on the physical, intellectual, and moral degenerations
of the human species and on the causes which produce these unhealthy
variations]), the first theory of degeneration as a hereditary, race-based
problem: "Degeneration has to be spoken of as a pathological deviation
from an original type [<i>Typus</i>]. This deviation, even if, at the
outset, it was ever so slight, contains transmissible elements of such
a nature that anyone bearing them becomes more and more incapable of
fulfilling his tasks to humanity; moreover, intellectual progress, which
is already inhibited in his own person, finds itself endangered in his
descendents as well" (<i>E,</i> 1:32). Building on Morel's work, Nordau
argues that degenerate organisms&#8212;as pathological deviations from
the norm&#8212;produce offspring that, to an even greater degree, suffer
from debilitation and malformations. As examples of physical degeneracy,
he names various deformities such as stunted growth, asymmetry of the face
and cranium, protruding ears, squinted eyes, pointed or flat palates,
syn- and polydactylia, all of which are meant to establish the power
and value of the norm over the deviation.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 These offspring, living among "us" today at the fin de si&egrave;cle,
 represent the "end of race": Although Nordau is optimistic that they
 will "fortunately soon become sterile" (<i>E,</i> 1:32) and die out,
 the societal risk is that degenerates will be "imitated," rather
 than shunned, as if their deviations somehow represented new social
 norms. Here, we can detect the first expression of Nordau's social
 Darwinism, something that runs throughout the entire book and will,
 later, become an essential part of his conceptualization of the tasks
 of Zionism.

<p>
Besides inspiring imitation, the other danger posed by degenerates,
Nordau asserts, is that they throw the binary organization of the world
into "mystical" disarray: good and evil, virtue and vice, right and
wrong, beautiful and ugly become nothing more than empty, "arbitrary
distinctions" (<i>E,</i> 1:35). This anxiety becomes particularly
evident in his discussion of the literary decadence of the novels of
Jos&eacute;phin P&eacute;ladan and J.-K. Huysmans. In Huysmans's novel,
<i>A rebours</i>, we not only find a radical revaluation of traditional
binary categories for ordering experience&#8212;male/female, right/wrong,
progress/decline, health/sickness, moral/immoral, true/false, and so
forth&#8212;but we encounter the representation of a world in which
binary categories themselves are no longer reliable structuring matrices
for organizing experience.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 The novel portrays the perceptions and experience of a physically
 anemic and nervous man by the name of Duke Jean des Esseintes, who,
 in Nordau's description, can no longer distinguish between dreams
 and reality, right and wrong, near and far, present and past; he is,
 instead, nothing more than the embodiment of an endless array of
 monstrous sensory experiences. Nordau sums up his discussion of Des
 Esseintes with these overblown words:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We now have him, the "super-man" of whom Baudelaire and his disciples
dream, and whom they wish to resemble: physically, sick and feeble;
morally, an arrant scoundrel; intellectually, an unspeakable idiot
who passes his days choosing the colors of things to drape his room
artistically, observing the movements of mechanical fish, sniffing
perfumes,

<b></b>

and sipping liqueurs. . . . His complete inability to adapt reveals
itself in the fact that every contact with the world and other human
beings brings pain. . . . A parasite of the lowest level of education,
a sort of human sacculus [a parasite, Nordau notes, that is virtually
indistinguishable from the "diseased excrescence of its host's
intestines"]. [<i>E,</i> 2:119-20]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The degenerate hero of Huysmans's novel thus stands radically opposed
to Nordau's ideal of the "sane" and "healthy" man who sees clear forms,
articulates sensible ideas, acts with purpose, restrains his emotions,
adapts easily to new situations, and is morally disciplined and physically
strong. As we will see shortly, Nordau conceives of the body and the
behavior of both the "true moderns" and the muscle Jew in stark contrast
to Huysmans's re of degeneracy.

<p>
As a good social Darwinist, Nordau ends the book on a note of
"therapeutic" optimism, directed at the "highest educated classes"
(<i>E,</i> 2:545), who are not yet entirely seduced by the "ravings"
of the degenerate artists:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The weak, the degenerate will perish; the strong will adapt themselves to
the achievements of civilization or will subordinate them to their own
organic capacity. . . . The art of the twentieth century will connect
itself at every point to that of the past, but it will have a new task
to fulfill: to bring a stimulating variety to the uniformity of cultured
life, an influence that probably only science, many centuries later, will
be in a position to exert over the great majority of humankind. [<i>E,</i>
2:544]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus Nordau predicts that the twentieth century will bring an end to
both degeneracy and degenerate art; art will return to its traditional,
canonical forms, and science will combat superstition and mysticism
through the force of its truth. In the end, only the "true moderns"
(<i>E,</i> 2:562)&#8212;those who are best adapted to the demands
of modern society through discipline, rationality, and clarity of
vision&#8212;will survive. On the last pages of his book, Nordau concludes
his apocalyptic fantasy with an image of the degenerate "vermin" being
crushed and beaten to death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Whoever believes with me that society is the natural organic form
of humanity, . . . whoever considers civilization to be a good that
has value and deserves to be defended, must mercilessly crush the
anti-social vermin [<i>Ungeziefer</i>] under his thumbs. . . . We cry:
"Get out of our civilized society [<i>Gesittung</i>]! Rove far from
us! . . . if you dare return to us, we will pitilessly beat you to death
with clubs." [<i>E,</i> 2:556-7]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "degenerates" are no better than vermin and must be expelled or
clubbed to death in order for Nordau and the ranks of the true moderns
to secure the values of civil society according to the violent mechanisms
of social evolution.

<p>
Indeed, as other critics have pointed out, it is here that Nordau's own
ideas for social exclusion evidence a decidedly uncomfortable resemblance
to national-<i>v&ouml;lkisch</i> ideologies and their own obsession with
ridding society of its so-called "anti-social vermin." Although one can
definitely argue that certain elements of National Socialist ideology
were first conceptualized around the fin de si&egrave;cle&#8212;one
might cite Julius

<b></b>

Langbehn as an originator of <i>v&ouml;lkisch</i> nationalism, or Nordau's
diatribe against "degenerate art" as complicit with the eugenics of
social Darwinism
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
&#8212;I am not interested in attempting to trace the reception
history of Nordau's ideas past his turn to Zionism in 1895 and his
own formulation of the muscle Jew a few years later. In what follows,
then, I want to show how Nordau invented an aesthetic discourse of
regeneracy through the muscle Jew, who, like the "normal man," rises
to the challenges of modernity and does not degenerate but rather
re-embodies his race by becoming a "true modern."


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
III. Muscle Jews as "True Moderns"
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In the speech he delivered at the first Zionist Congress in 1897,
Nordau described two kinds of Jewish suffering. The first, material
suffering, afflicted the great majority of orthodox, Eastern Jews who
lived in poverty and were legally disenfranchised, second-rate citizens
of their "host" countries; the second, moral suffering, referred to the
minority of assimilated, Western Jews, who had, by and large, abandoned
Judaism but were still not fully welcome in their countries of birth
or residence. They suffer even more bitterly, Nordau argues, because
they are forced to hide their Jewish heritage and are nevertheless
still subject to anti-Semitic aspersions. He concludes the speech with
a strangely veiled threat&#8212;directed foremost at the Jews attending
the Zionist Congress who might act as ambassadors to other Jews and to
Christians in general&#8212;that Jews could destructively "degenerate,"
like lethal microbes, if the Zionist cause were not supported:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Neither Christians nor Jews can indifferently ignore Jewish suffering. It
is a great sin to let a people degenerate [<i>verkommen zu lassen</i>]
in mental and physical need . . . it is a sin to the work of civilized
society [<i>Gesittung</i>], and the Jewish people could and would
gladly be energetic partners. And it can turn into a great danger
for everyone if strong-willed people, whose size extends beyond
the average in good and bad, become embittered through undignified
treatment and, through embitterment, become enemies to the existing order
[<i>Ordnung</i>]. Microbiology teaches us that microorganisms that are
harmless as long as they are living in open-air turn into terrible,
disease-causing pathogens if one deprives them of oxygen and, to use
the technical language, transforms them into anaerobes. Governments and
peoples had better beware of making the Jews into anaerobic beings. They
could have a high price to pay, regardless of what they do, to get
rid of these Jews who they turned into pests [<i>Sch&auml;dling</i>]
by their own guilt. [<i>SP,</i> 1:20]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What makes this warning so striking (besides the fact that it was uttered
as part of an opening speech at the first Zionist Congress) is that Nordau
has clumsily imported the conceptual terminology of <i>Degeneration</i>
into the Zionist cause but with a defiant, Jewish twist: "Civilized
society," with its rules of discipline and order, is still the goal;
but now, if Jews are not allowed to participate in its construction as
partners, at the very least, through their own efforts at nation building,
Nordau admonishes both assimilated Jews and Christians alike that the
embittered Jews, through their strong wills, might be transformed into
disease-causing pathogens who will undermine its

<b></b>

very foundations. Whereas a few years earlier parasites, microbes, and
vermin were exclusively identified with the "degenerates" who were to
be shunned and crushed by the "true moderns"&#8212;the only rational
defenders of civil society&#8212;now degeneracy could be re-embodied,
as it were, by Jews working to subvert the anti-Semitic hegemony. Far
from the weak and ineffectually degenerate Jews of the anti-Semitic
imagination and equally far from the degenerate artists crushed to death
by the true moderns, these microbe-like "pests" would vigorously exact
revenge on civil society.

<p>
Needless to say, this formulation of the embittered Zionist Jew as
destructive anaerobe would not be Nordau's greatest claim to fame within
the Zionist movement. In fact, at the second and third Zionist Congresses
in 1898 and 1899, he would entirely forgo this revaluation of parasitic
degeneracy in favor of a mythically heroic re of regeneration,
namely the muscle Jew. To be fair to Nordau, he&#8212;very much
unlike contemporary anti-Semitic ideologues such as Houston Stewart
Chamberlain or the self-hating Otto Weininger&#8212;never considered
Jews inherently "degenerate" nor did he endorse the racial determinism
and popular conspiracy theories of the anti-Semitic imagination. Whereas
Weininger, for example, gladly co-opted Chamberlain's arguments for Jewish
inferiority in his <i>Sex and Character</i> , considering the Jew
to be "a spreading parasite, straggling all over the earth and finding
true root nowhere, . . . [able] to adapt himself to every circumstance
and every race, becoming, like the parasite, a new creature in every
different host, although remaining essentially the same,"
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Nordau only invokes the concepts and arguments of <i>Degeneration</i>
 in order to describe the range of Jewish suffering and to advocate
 for a national solution. As Anita Shapira has pointed out with
 respect to Nordau and his contemporaneous German Zionist colleagues,
 Nordau's "acceptance of the anti-Semitic diagnosis did not entail
 concomitant acceptance of the racist deterministic prognosis preached
 by anti-Semitic ideologues."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Jews would only behave like "parasites" if they were working to
 undermine the oppressive social and political structures that treated
 them as such.

<p>
Nevertheless, in the early years of Zionism, Nordau and other Zionist
cofounders sometimes legitimized the anti-Semitic diagnosis of Jewish
degeneracy through their increasingly nationalistic rhetoric of moral,
physical, social, and even linguistic regeneration.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 In 1898, for example, shortly after the first Zionist Congress in
 Basel, Nordau published an essay entitled "The Tasks of Zionism" in
 which he argues that Zionism has two fundamental goals: The first is
 "to conquer" Palestine for the Jewish people and the second is "to
 prepare" the Jewish people for Palestine.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 He considers the second to be the absolute prerequisite of the first
 and urges Jews to begin to think of themselves simultaneously as a
 single "people" [<i>Volk</i>] and as autonomous citizens who, with
 the discipline of soldiers, could contribute to the reformation of the
 fragmented whole. By depriving Jews of "organic coherence" and "unity,"
 Nordau argues, "the Galut made a chaos out of us," creating a people
 completely without the knowledge, ability, and experience to establish
 the necessary infrastructure (from police headquarters and juridical
 organizations to administrations for taxation, postage, engineering,
 and education) for building a civil society ("AZ," 323). The first
 thing that every single Jew had to learn was "to feel the affairs of
 the entire Jewish people as his own

<b></b>

personal concern and to listen with iron obedience to the leaders that
they chose; in other words, the most engaged possible participation in
the affairs of the people, and manly discipline [<i>Mannszucht</i>]"
("AZ," 324).

<p>
Through discipline, always a masculine quality for Nordau, Jews could
"relearn" lost ideals, moral principles, social behaviors, worthy customs,
and a serious work ethic before emigrating to Palestine. In order to
"become, once again, a fully entitled citizen [<i>B&uuml;rger</i>]
of his own people" ("AZ," 325), the Jew had to reform his body and
behavior patterns in accordance with the standards of bourgeois civil
society. Although he concedes that it took Moses "forty years to educate
his people" ("AZ," 327), Nordau is confident that the Zionist program of
disciplined regeneration will take place much faster. Through a rigorous
work ethic entailing the creation of order, unity, and harmony of purpose,
Jews could act "like good soldiers" ("AZ," 326), charged with vigorously
reconstituting their race and methodically establishing a new society
in Palestine.

<p>
Elaborating on the transformation of the Jew into a soldier
of regeneration, Nordau gave an inspiring speech to Jewish college
students the following year in which he allied his own Jewish heritage
with a triumphal strain of Greek history. Far from being condemned
to historical oblivion like the routed Helots, Zionist Jews&#8212;as
masculine ters&#8212;would now re-embody the heroic, martial tradition
of the Spartans.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 In this deeply personal account of his own path to Zionism, Nordau
 recounts how, in his childhood, he learned about the defeated Helots
 and even planned, at one time, to write his own "Helot tragedy" ("HS,"
 376). This never happened, he tells his listeners, and he forgot
 about the Helots until "the war howls of anti-Semitism" ("HS," 376)
 at the fin de si&egrave;cle thrust them back before his eyes: Jews,
 he feared, might become nothing more than modern-day Helots. Zionism,
 he adamantly retorts, is precisely why Jews will never become like the
 poor Helots; Zionist Jews, he concludes, "are Spartans. . . . For to be
 a Zionist means to be doubly and triply a ter" ("HS," 378). Through
 "manly discipline" and military dominance, Nordau imagined Zionism as
 an ideology of the Jew-Greek warrior.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Whereas earlier Jews and non-Jews of the Enlightenment called for cultural
<i>Bildung</i> (education) and social <i>Verbesserung</i> (improvement)
in order to achieve Jewish assimilation within German society,
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 Nordau shifts attention to what he perceives to be "a missing corporeal
 upbringing" (<i>eine fehlende, k&ouml;rperliche Erziehung</i>)
 (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:110). He urges Jews&#8212;in his case,
 male Jews&#8212;to become strong and muscular by participating in
 athletic associations, and argues that exercise, specifically gymnastics
 (<i>das Turnen</i>), is of the utmost importance for the health of the
 Jewish race. Due to a range of historical reasons largely connected to
 anti-Semitism and the challenges of life in the Diaspora, the Jewish
 body had been "destroyed" (<i>abget&ouml;dtet</i>). In the cramped
 quarters of the Jewish ghetto streets, Jews forgot how to move their
 limbs freely; in dark houses, their eyes blinked nervously; out of
 fear of persecution, their formerly strident voices turned to mere
 whispers (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 2:10). As a redemptive re, then,
 the muscle Jew represents both a future ideal and the return to a
 heroic Jewish tradition characterized by the likes of Bar Kochba and
 the Maccabees. In his rally cry

<b></b>

for a "muscle Jewry," Nordau proudly asserts that Zionists are rejoining
"our oldest traditions by becoming strong-chested, tautly jointed, boldly
gazing men [<i>tiefbr&uuml;stige, strammgliedrige, k&uuml;hnblickende
M&auml;nner</i>]" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 2:10).

<p>
The Zionist muscle Jew, at least in Nordau's articulation of the re,
is a resolutely masculine ter, characterized by the drive for Jews to
become once again heroic warriors. It is here that Nordau underscores
the masculinity of the battle-ready Jew: "Our new muscle Jews have
not yet regained the heroism of their forefathers . . . to take part
in battles and compete with the trained Hellenic athletes and strong
northern barbarians. But morally speaking, we are better off today than
yesterday, for the old Jewish circus performers of yore were ashamed of
their Judaism and sought, by way of a surgical pinch, to hide the sign
of their religious affiliation . . . while today, the members of Bar
Kochba proudly and freely proclaim their Jewishness." (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900,
no. 2:11). In other words, the male members of the Bar Kochba gymnastics
association are no longer ashamed of their circumcised penis; instead,
they show off their "surgical pinch" with pride.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 The organ of Jewish virility evokes national pride.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Although the phallocentrism of Nordau's Zionist ideal cannot be
 overlooked in his characterization of the muscle Jew, a well-developed,
 semibalancing discourse surrounding "the need for female gymnastics"
 and female muscle Jews (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 5:76-80) also emerged, as
 we will see, in the pages of <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> around
 the overlapping themes of fertility, family, and sexual reproduction.

<p>
When <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> was founded in Berlin in May
1900 as "the official organ of the Jewish gymnastics association,"
its purpose was to realize Jewish national goals through corporeal
means. Over its twenty years, the journal published an array of
materials, ranging from historical discussions of ancient Jewish
greatness to battle songs, fitness programs, schedules and results of
various gymnastics competitions, photographs of exemplary muscle Jews
(. <a name="4" href="10.2presner_res.html#4">4</a>
and <a name="5" href="10.2presner_res.html#5">5</a>), and
medical discussions of the benefits of sun, light, and movement for a
potent sexuality. A leitmotiv that ran throughout the journal was the
"physical improvement" of the Eastern European Jew, so often pejoratively
characterized as the <i>Jammergeschlecht</i> (wretched race), with
a hunched-over body, crooked posture, awkward gait, underdeveloped
musculature, and nervous disposition. Pictures of strong Jewish
gymnasts with upright postures, elegant movements, developed muscles,
and assured confidence were not only meant to provide inspiration and
reclaim an ancient, heroic ideal; the bodies they depicted were also
hailed as the preconditions of a successful project of nation building
(. <a name="6" href="10.2presner_res.html#6">6</a>
and <a name="7" href="10.2presner_res.html#7">7</a>). In
its first edition, the journal proclaimed five goals: the creation
of a strong Jewish body, the creation of a strong Jewish community,
the reinvigoration of old Jewish ideals of heroism, the ting of
anti-Semitism, and the cultivation of a national feeling. It is no
coincidence that, as the primary means of staving off what Herzl once
called "the family affliction" of Jewish degeneracy,
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Jewish athletic and gymnastic associations sprang up simultaneously
 with Zionism throughout many German-speaking cities. In 1903, five years
 after Nordau invented the concept of the muscle Jew, <i>DieJ&uuml;dische
 Turnzeitung</i> began carrying the subtitle "monthly for the corporeal
 improvement of the Jews." It boasted that there were already thirteen
 "national-Jewish gymnastics associations"

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 285]</b>

and that "we should strive to have every Zionist association develop
a gymnastics division" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 1:3).

<p>
Indeed, this emphasis on corporeal regeneracy should come as no surprise
since Zionism emerged from the same fin de si&egrave;cle culture that had
spawned numerous other body reform movements, ranging from the women's
and the homosexual emancipation

<b></b>

movements to the youth, sports, fitness, and nudist movements, all of
which were striving to gain social recognition and political momentum.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 It was precisely during this period that Jewish gymnastics associations
 and Jewish <i>Wanderklubs</i> came into existence across Europe, many
 taking the German youth and body reform movements&#8212;especially
 the Wandervogel&#8212;as their shared starting point.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung,</i> for example, published
travelogues of hiking trips and other outdoor journeys that the Jewish
gymnasts undertook, as well as military songs, such as the so-called
<i>Mannerlied,</i> which celebrated their heroic masculinity.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 And over the course of the next decade, in part because the
 anti-Semitism of the Wandervogel kept many Jews from participating
 in the German youth movement, Jewish gymnastics associations began to
 establish their own <i>Wanderklubs</i>.

<p>
In a lead article entitled "Gr&uuml;ndet Wanderklubs!" published in
<i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> in 1908, Georg Arndt officially
called for the establishment of Jewish hiking clubs, arguing that such
clubs would solidify "the kernel of a disciplined, goal-conscious team,"
something that was important for "every national gymnastics" (<i>JTZ,</i>
1908, no. 7). The same year, Theobald Scholem argued that Jewish "body
culture" (<i>K&ouml;rperkultur</i>) must not restrict itself to indoor
activities since the "gymnastics hall is only a substitute" for nature:
"Above all, we need light and air and forest and fields." Responding to a
reservation on the part of Jewish gymnastics associations to supporting
patriotic hiking trips analogous to those of their German counterparts,
Scholem critically asked, "We Jews are scattered throughout the world
and forced, because of our fate, eternally to wander. Why do we not
go outside into nature? Is it that we have lost the desire to wander
because of our incessant search for a home, because wandering has
become a symbol of our misfortune? . . . There must not be any Jewish
gymnastics association which refuses to undertake hiking trips. . . . In
the forests and fields, in rain or in sun, the Jew will get to know what
he has lost for millennia, namely love of mother earth" (<i>JTZ,</i>
1908, no. 6:112). He emphasizes light, air, and free movement in nature,
all constitutive components of the rhetoric of contemporaneous German
body reform movements. In essence, he is calling for a Jewish version
of the Wandervogel, something that would actually come into existence by
1912 under the name "Blau-Weiss" (Blue-White), a Jewish youth association
dedicated to scouting, fitness, and Jewish patriotism.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
As early as November 1900, in an article on "The Tasks of the Jewish
Gymnast," Emanuel Edelstein, echoing Nordau's ideas, postulates that
physical strength is the prerequisite of a "favorable solution to the
Jewish question." He situates the Jewish question&#8212;"at once a
social, racial, and national question"&#8212;within a neo-Hegelian
framework, which holds that world history, as it plays out in its
particular national inflections, is nothing but a history of opposition,
"a battle for nationality and a race war" (<i>einNationalit&auml;tskampf
und ein Racenkrieg</i>) (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 7:73-4). He sees these
battles for recognition occurring all over the world: in Asia, China,
the Philippines, as well as in the Spanish-American War, the impending
war between England and Russia, and, of course, the Zionist cause. Citing
Nordau's concept of muscle Jewry directly, he places the solution to
the Jewish question within these historical lineages

<b></b>

of bellicosity. In order to overcome the nervousness, degeneracy and
weakness of the Jewish race and form a robust nation, Jews need to "become
men!" (<i>werdet M&auml;nner!</i>) (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 7:74). Edelstein
calls upon the heroic male tradition in ancient Judaism, but in contrast
to the singular phallocentrism of Nordau's muscle Jew, he is also the
first author in <i>DieJ&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> to draw attention to
the heroic female tradition, which he links to a historical argument for
creating a stronger Jewish race: "Daughters of Israel, whose beauty has
radiated across all time since Sara and is still uncontested, recognized,
and sung today; there is a Miriam, a Deborah, a Judith, a Ruth and an
Esther for you to emulate, names that can never be erased. Take part in
everything that endows your body with power, agility, and grace. Become
a strong and healthy sex [<i>ein starkes und gesundesGeschlecht</i>]
and you, too, will play an important part in helping to solve the Jewish
question" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 7:75).
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
Although the discourses of Jewish regeneration and nationality were
almost completely dominated by male thinkers, the necessity of "female
gymnastics" was recognized in <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i>
from the very start. In answering the charge that "gymnastics is
unfeminine, . . . [that] we don't need strong females [<i>weibliche
Kraftmenschen</i>]," the editors retorted: "Is it unfeminine to
improve the functioning of the heart and lungs, the circulation of the
blood and the metabolism through purposive strengthening movements
(if possible in the open air), to toughen the muscles, and awaken
an enthusiasm for movement, a sense of well-being, and a gaiety in
play and hiking?" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 9:118). Although the editors
demurred somewhat with respect to the question of creating female muscle
Jews, they did argue unequivocally that "it pays off for everyone when
we recognize that one of the first tasks of today is to strengthen
and preserve the health of the female sex by giving the most serious
attention to gymnastics" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 9:119-20). Indeed, for
the majority of the first decade of the journal's existence, the theory
of female gymnastics was primarily articulated by men. In fact, it was
not until 1911 that the journal published a speech by Betti Eger of the
woman's division of the Jewish gymnastics association in which she argues,
on behalf of the female members, "We want to contribute to the health of
our people's body [<i>Volksk&ouml;rper</i>]. We want to become strong
muscle Jews [<i>kr&auml;ftige Muskeljuden</i>]" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1911,
no. 4:75). Confirming the significant health benefits of gymnastics
that her male colleagues consistently emphasized, Eger argues that
gymnastics would not only produce healthier mothers but also beget
stronger children. For this reason, she maintains, female muscle Jews are
just as important as male muscle Jews for the creation of the new state.

<p>
Support for female gymnastics among the male representatives was never,
however, entirely liberating since the discussions in <i>Die J&uuml;dische
Turnzeitung</i> quite clearly limited the social role of women to healthy
reproduction and motherhood. Richard Blum, for example, in comparing
antique and modern gymnastics, explains that female gymnastics was
important to the Spartans because, like today, "the strength and health
of the nation is vitally dependent upon the strength and health of the
mother" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 2:32). In a follow-up article entitled
"Girl's and Women's Gymnastics" , he argues that gymnastics is
crucial for the health and strength of the female body and, by extension,
the Jewish nation. Blum's concern is not with women's liberation

<b></b>

per se but with the role of women for the fertility of the nation. Women
need to "liberate" themselves, he argues, from the crutch of the corset
by strengthening their own back muscles and assuming a healthy posture;
this will enable, in his medical opinion, healthy Jewish women, with
strong back muscles, powerful lungs, and freely circulating blood, to
produce stronger children, in turn, "serving your sisters, your families,
your communities, and your nation!" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 5:80).

<p>
From the very beginning of the muscle Jew discourse, then, corporeal
training was explicitly linked to the production of nationality, an
association that derived both its theoretical program and historical
legitimacy from the German "father" of gymnastics, Friedrich Ludwig
Jahn. Transferring Jahn's ideas of German fraternity, brotherhood,
and nationality to the Jewish cause, Felix Meyer, in an article on the
"Hygienic Value of Gymnastics," connects the history of German nationality
to the development of Jewish nationality: "After Prussia was defeated
by the hand of the great Napoleon, . . . men like Jahn came forward. . . [and] recognized that the foundation for a moral rebirth of the
people was to be found in personal self-defense, that a strengthening
of the courage of the individual [would do the same] for the nation"
(<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 4:46). He then draws a parallel between the
situation of the German people after 1806 and that of contemporary
Jews who "have a right and a duty to be a nation" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901,
no. 4:46). Like the German national body, the Jewish national body would
similarly be reassembled once the individual bodies of the Jews were
strengthened and regenerated.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 Applying the ideas of Jahn directly to the Jews, Blum points out that
 modern Jews cannot "afford to close their eyes to the successes which
 the German people recorded with its gymnastics associations." To
 support his point, he quotes Jahn: "Only the beneficial training
 [<i>Ausbildung</i>] of the entire human being [through gymnastics]
 protects against any sort of corporeal and mental crippling and
 deformation" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 6:62). In the same way that Jahn
 believed gymnastics to be necessary for the "inner elevation of the
 German fatherland and people, . . . in order to build up a new Germany,"
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 the Zionists considered gymnastics to be necessary for the
 rebirth of a long-lost heroic ideal and the prerequisite
 for the "conquering" of Palestine (<a name="8"
 href="10.2presner_res.html#8"> 8</a>).

<p>
But the muscle Jew discourse, as conceived by Nordau and made visual
in <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung,</i> not only built upon the
masculine heroism of the Germanic tradition, it was also suffused by
a social ethos of survival of the fittest, in which Jews, overcoming
the extenuating circumstances which had rendered them weak, could
now adapt to the new challenges of nation building and become "true
moderns" in order to thrive. As Nordau writes in his call for all Jews
to practice gymnastics in order to re-create a muscle Jewry, "Our muscles
are outstandingly capable of development. . . . No one need be satisfied
with the muscles he is given. Everyone can have the muscles that he wishes
for. Methodical, persistent exercise is all that is necessary. Every Jew
who is or believes himself to be weak can attain the musculature of an
athlete" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:112). Although a cursory reading may
render these ideas more like a kind of self-help guide for achieving
the body you've always wanted, the adaptability of the Jew through the
cultivation of discipline and physical musculature explains precisely
why the Jew is not "degenerate." After all, adaptability, as Nordau
argued in <i>Degeneration</i>,

<b></b>

is both the prerequisite of social evolution and the critical
characteristic for becoming a "true modern."

<p>
In this respect, then, Nordau's 1892 argument is quite consistent
and continuous with his Zionist call for the re-creation of a muscle
Jewry. Through their heroic traditions, Jews embody precisely what
degenerates are not. In <i>Degeneration</i>, he distinguishes between
organisms and races that are degenerate and those that are capable of
adapting themselves to historical circumstances:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As long as the vital powers of an individual as well as of a race are not
entirely consumed, the organism makes efforts, actively or passively, to
adapt itself by seeking to change injurious conditions or by adjusting
itself in such a way that conditions that cannot be changed cause as
little damage as possible. Degenerates, hysterics, and neurasthenics are
not capable of adaptation. Therefore, they are fated to disappear. They
will become irretrievably destroyed because they do not know how to come
to terms with reality. [<i>E,</i> 2:528]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Jews, on the other hand, just like their muscles, are entirely capable of
development and adaptation. Despite the historical challenges presented
by anti-Semitism, Jews&#8212; 

<b></b>

as a race&#8212;are not innately degenerate and cannot be classed along
with hysterics and neurasthenics. In fact, precisely because of their
discipline and commitment to the ethical and social principles underlying
civil society, they are capable of embodying the social Darwinist spirit
of the "true moderns."

<p>
Nordau concedes that he was at first willing to accept the anti-Semitic
stereotype of the weak Jew as a national-racial characteristic given
some historical evidence proving that Jews were "small" in stature and
that present-day Jews are "on average somewhat smaller than Germans,
Russians, Anglo-Saxons, and Scandinavians." But he is convinced that Jews
are not racially "degenerate" and that Jewish self-improvement is both
possible and desirable (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:111). Their small size
and ostensible physical weakness&#8212;which may, at first sight, appear
to be "evidence of degeneration" (<i>Entartungserscheinung</i>)&#8212;can
easily be explained by the fact that Jews have "necessarily lost their
ability for physical fitness, having lived for a thousand years deprived
of exercise in the ghetto" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:110). To regain it,
all that is necessary is disciplined training.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 At no point does Nordau ever situate Jews&#8212;whether assimilated,
 Western Jewry or so-called <i>Ostjuden</i>&#8212;under the rubric
 of degeneracy that he developed in his 1892 book. If Jews have
 "deviated from their race or kind," to invoke the conceptual history
 of the term <i>degeneration,</i> then it is because the "original
 type"&#8212;namely, the heroic muscle Jew of Bar Kochba and the
 Maccabees&#8212;has been "destroyed" through the violent historical
 mechanisms of anti-Semitism. Far from replicating the racial grounds
 for explaining the pervasiveness and expected death of both degenerate
 art and the degenerate artists themselves, Jews, Nordau maintains,
 represent a latent race of "Spartan" ters who will not perish by
 the challenges modernity presents. Instead, through their discipline
 and adaptability, the weak Jews will be able to evolve back into
 muscle Jews, uniting, in turn, their scattered people and founding
 a new nation with all the scientific solidity and racial strength of
 the greatest European civil societies.

<p>
Articulated around a paternal picture of himself (<a name="9"
HREF="10.2presner_res.html#9"> 9</a>), Nordau's 1902
article, "What Does Gymnastics Mean for Us Jews?" specifies precisely
why gymnastics is central to the Zionist project. Gymnastics not
only makes one healthier "by facilitating the physical development
of strength as well as beauty," but it also "teaches manly discipline
[<i>Manneszucht</i>], reciprocal adaptation to different personalities,
and carefully constructed combinations of many efforts leading to
a single, common goal" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:109). Besides its
corporeal benefits, gymnastics also embodies certain ideals&#8212;such as
intellectual clarity, moral rectitude, and social competence&#8212;that
correspond with races that are well-adapted, disciplined, and healthy. It
is the perfect way of training individual Jews to strengthen their
own bodies and work together for the attainment of a shared national
goal. Jews thus gain in both physical strength and moral character. Muscle
Jews are known for their "ruthless boldness," "complete mastery of
the muscle groups," "energetic exclusion of inhibitions of an anxious
or doubting nature," and, finally, "mental nimbleness, clarity, and
sharpness" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:112). In the muscle Jew, intellectual
acuity is matched by physical prowess&#8212;and it is this ideal which
is to be cultivated through the propagation of the race.

<b></b>

<p>
In conclusion, then, it is no coincidence that Nordau's description of the
muscle Jew is diametrically opposed to his descriptions of the degenerate
characters in the novels of P&eacute;ladan or Huysmans. Conceptually,
the muscle Jew is essentially the outgrowth of Nordau's "normal man,"
who, rising to the challenges of modernity, transforms himself into a
true modern and crushes the degenerates to death. This is how Nordau
describes the prototype of the muscle Jew in 1892:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The normal man, with his clear mind, logical thought, sound judgment,
and strong will, sees, where the degenerate only gropes; he plans and
acts where the latter only dozes and dreams. . . . Let us imagine the
driveling Zoroaster of Nietzsche, with his cardboard lions, eagles,
and serpents from a toyshop, or the noctambulist Des Esseintes of the
Decadents, sniffing and licking his lips . . . let us imagine these beings
in competition with men who rise early, and are not weary before sunset,
who have clear heads, solid stomachs, and hard muscles: the comparison
will provoke laughter. [E, 2:529]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



Just like the "normal" Jew, the normal man&#8212;able to adapt to the
exigencies of modernity and become both potent and muscular&#8212;is
characterized by clarity of perception, discipline, adaptability, and,
most of all, physical strength. He rises early and works diligently all
day long; he maintains focus and acts decisively; he works out and has
washboard abs to show for it. He is the re-embodiment of the strength
of his race.

<p>
In this respect, then, the goal of the muscle Jew discourse was not
simply the rejuvenation of the individual body but rather the creation of
a modern body politic through the aesthetics of corporeal regeneracy. On
the one hand, the muscle Jew harkens back to a bygone, mythological time
as the embodiment of "true Jewishness," a concept not entirely divorced
from other contemporaneous calls for "<i>Volkst&uuml;mlichkeit</i>"
or "true Germanness."On the other hand, the muscle Jew&#8212;through
his discipline, adaptability, and strength&#8212;represents a modern,
evolutionary break, one in which the achievements of civilization
are elevated to a higher, more refined level. Nordau concludes
<i>Degeneration</i> with these fateful words, which might just as well
describe the tasks of Zionism and the duties of the muscle Jew: "The
criteria by which the true moderns can be recognized and distinguished
from impostors calling themselves modern are the following: Whoever
preaches absence of discipline is an enemy of progress; whoever worships
his 'I' is an enemy to society. Society's first premise is love of one's
neighbor and the capacity for sacrifice; progress is the effect of an
ever more rigorous subjugation of the beast in man, of an ever tenser
self-restraint, of an ever keener sense of duty and responsibility"
(<i>E,</i> 2:562). It might well be that the concept of the muscle
Jew&#8212;through its paradoxical aesthetics of regeneracy&#8212;is
modernity's most emblematic form of discipline and social progress.

Bar Kochba led the Judeans in the revolt against the Roman Empire in
A.D. 132, which was ultimately suppressed in 135. As Yael Zerubavel
argues, "[in] Zionist collective memory the Bar Kochba revolt symbolizes
the nation's last expression of patriotic ardor and the last struggle
for freedom during Antiquity." <i>Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and

1905 and 1910. According to Eduard Fuchs in 1921, <i>Kikeriki</i>
was likely the oldest anti-Semitic journal in Austria still in
circulation. It was founded in 1862 as "a general and political comic
magazine with a specifically anticlerical critique. . . . With the rise
of the Christian-Social Party in Austria during the 1890s, the journal
gave up its original character and placed itself more and more in the
service of anti-Semitism." <i>Die Juden in der Karikatur: Ein Beitrag
zur Kulturgeschichte</i> (Munich: A. Langen, 1921), 238-9.

Besides co-curating the first Jewish national art exhibition at the fifth
Zionist Congress in 1901, Lilien published two book illustrations prior
to completing the "Altneuland" picture: <i>Juda</i>  and <i>Lieder
des Ghetto</i> (1902/03). Schooled in the aesthetics of Jugendstil
while studying in Munich and Berlin, Lilien uses and revalues the visual
language of decadence in order to give form to the Zionist concept of
progressive regeneration. The best contemporary overview of Lilien's
work through 1903 is <i>E. M. Lilien: Sein Werk, mit einer Einleitung
von Stefan Zweig</i> (Berlin, 1903). For more recent criticism, see
Milly Heyd, "Lilien: Between Herzl and Ahasver," in <i>Theodor Herzl:
Visionary of the Jewish State,</i> ed. Gideon Shimoni and Robert
S. Wistrich (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 1999),
265-93. See also Michael Stanislawski's chapter, "From Jugendstil to
'Judenstil': Cosmopolitanism and Nationalism in the Work of Ephraim
Moses Lilien," in <i>Zionism and the Fin de Si&egrave;cle</i>. Neither
Heyd nor Stanislawski discusses the "Altneuland" illustration.

The caricature is also reformulating the legend of the "seven Swabians,"
a legend that was made popular by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the
same name. In transforming the bungling Swabians into Jews and turning
the famous slogan, "Hannemann, geh du voran" (Hannemann, go forward),
into a Jewish imperative, "Jakele, geh du voran," the caricature equates
the famous cowardice of the leader Hannemann and his dastardly soldiers
with the Zionist project. I thank Hinrich C. Seeba for alerting me to
this reference.

Of course, the association of Jews and homosexuals was also a part of the
stock of anti-Semitic and homophobic rhetoric of fin de si&egrave;cle
Europe. The most famous diatribe to link Jews and homosexuals by way
of a deeply self-hating and misogynistic argument is Otto Weininger's
<i>Geschlecht und Charakter</i> (Sex and Character) of 1903. For a
critical assessment of Weininger within his intellectual context,
see <i>Jews and Gender: Responses to Otto Weininger,</i> ed. Nancy
A. Harrowitz and Barbara Hyams (Philadelphia: Temple University Press,
1995).

<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
Weininger put an even finer point on what he believed to be the ultimate
flaw of Zionism: "Zionism is the negation of Judaism, for the conception
of Judaism involves the world-wide distribution of the Jews. Citizenship
is an un-Jewish thing, and there has never been and never will be a true
Jewish State. The State involves the aggregation of individual aims, the
formation of and obedience to self-imposed laws; and the symbol of the
State, if nothing more, is its head chosen by free election. . . . The
true conception of the State is foreign to the Jew because he, like
the woman, is wanting in personality; his failure to grasp the idea of
true society is due to his lack of a free intelligible ego." <i>Sex and
Character</i> (London: William Heinemann, 1907), 307-8.

Nordau's conception of the muscle Jew is well-known and mentioned in
passing in countless studies of German Zionism or histories of Jewish
masculinity. Steven Ashheim, for example, briefly mentions the muscle
Jew in his important discussion of Western Zionist conceptions of health
and vitality, <i>Brothers and Strangers</i>: <i>The East European Jew in
German and German Jewish Consciousness, 1800-1923</i> (Madison: University
of Wisconsin Press, 1982), 87-8; Sander Gilman mentions the muscle Jew
on one page dedicated to the birth of Zionist gymnastics societies in
<i>The Jew's Body,</i> 53; Michael Berkowitz gives a somewhat more
detailed discussion of the same phenomenon in his chapter "Zionist
Heroes and New Men," in <i>Zionist Culture and West European Jewry
Before the First World War</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press,
1993); John Efron ends his highly informative chapter, "The Jewish Body
Degenerate?" with a brief discussion of Nordau. <i>Medicine and the
German Jews: A History</i> (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press,
2001), 149. Although not centered on the muscle Jew discourse per se,
Daniel Boyarin's highly suggestive and controversial book, <i>Unheroic
Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the Jewish
Man</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), offers an
incisive critique of Zionist discourses of masculinity while trying to
reclaim the "sissy" tradition, to use his term, for Judaism.

In an article on the hundredth anniversary of the publication of
Nordau's <i>Degeneration</i>, Mosse makes the important connection
between Nordau's earlier cultural criticism of "degenerate art" and
his Zionist project of cultivating "respectability" and "middle-class
standards of masculinity" for Judaism. I think that Mosse's argument is
exactly on target. I draw on his work here and extend it with additional
archival and visual evidence. "Max Nordau, Liberalism and the New Jew,"

down one way or the other, Michael Stanislawski, for example, writes that
"it is only a slight oversimplification to claim that [critical] opinion

completely contradictory to his previous views and those who see his
pre-Zionist views as seamlessly connected to his Zionism." <i>Zionism

The seminal texts to explore this are: Fritz Stern, <i>The Politics of
Cultural Despair: A Study of the Rise of Germanic Ideology</i> (Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1963); and George Mosse, <i>The Crisis of
German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich</i> (New York:
Universal Library, Grosset and Dunlap, 1964). Let me be unequivocally
clear about my own position: I am in no way suggesting that the ideas
expressed in Nordau's <i>Degeneration</i> led to the purifying ideology of
National Socialism; however, it is worth pointing out that the violence
of Nordau's social Darwinism and his cultural decisionism did have an
afterlife in the fervid adoption of race-science and eugenics in the
service of state formation (such as in the writings of Ludwig Woltmann)
or, later, the right-wing political theories of Carl Schmitt. Moreover,
in the twentieth century, <i>Ungeziefer</i> has consistently referred to
the abject of society, the absolutely vile deviation from the norm. Franz
Kafka famously thematized this in his short story <i>Die Verwandlung</i>
(The Metamorphosis), in which Gregor Samsa wakes up to find himself
transformed into an "Ungeziefer" and is ultimately killed by his
family for the sake of preserving bourgeois society. More ominously,
the association of Jews with parasites and vermin was a persistent topos
of Nazi propaganda, given a direct visual association in the virulently
anti-Semitic Nazi film <i>The Eternal Jew</i> .

Jews. For more on the idea of "educating" and "improving" the Jews before

Not only did the Greeks consider circumcision to be a mutilation of the
flesh, Greek athletes tended to tie and clasp the foreskin of the penis
during athletic competitions. Jewish athletes, who, like the Greeks,
performed in the nude, could not, of course, do this and were often
subject to public ridicule. However, with the development of an operation
known as <i>epispasm&oacute;s</i> (stretching), every Jew who performed
nude in the Olympic games at Tyre had a remnant of his foreskin pulled
over the

<b></b>

crown of his penis. See Allen Edwardes, <i>Erotica Judaica:
A Sexual History of the Jews</i> (New York: Julian Press, 1967),
esp. chap. 9. Interestingly, Lilien's "Altneuland" illustration shows
the rear of the muscle Jew, but does not proudly display the Jewish penis.

national pride as well as newfound Jewish masculinity." <i>Zionism and

Hans Bl&uuml;her, the founder and primary exponent of the German
Wandervogel movement, later argued in his book, <i>Die Rolle der
Erotik in der m&auml;nnlichen Gesellschaft</i> (The role of the erotic
in masculine society), that "erotic," male-bonding experiences such
as those of sports competitions and the German youth movement were a
necessary prerequisite for both patriotism and state formation. Despite
Bl&uuml;her's well-known anti-Semitism, Jewish gymnastics associations
nevertheless applied certain aspects of his theories about hiking clubs,
physical fitness, and the erotic development of patriotism to the Zionist
cause. See <i>Die Rolle der Erotik in der m&auml;nnlichen Gesellschaft:

In addition to Jahn's, the ideas of J. G. Fichte represent the
most significant "German" antecedents to the Zionist interest in
strengthening the individual body in order to regenerate the body
of the nation. Jahn's <i>Deutsches Volksthum</i>  and <i>Die
deutsche Turnkunst</i>  as well as Fichte's <i>Reden an die
deutsche Nation</i>  consistently thematize the reassembly
and even the resurrection of the German nation through the physical
regeneracy of the individual's body. The best discussion of this idea
in Fichte can be found in Hinrich C. Seeba, "Auferstehung des Geistes:

Then the plane began to move along the ground, bumping like a motorcycle,
and then slowly rose into the air. We headed almost straight east of
Paris, rising in the air as though we were sitting inside a boat that
was being lifted by some giant, and the ground began to flatten out
beneath us. It looked cut into brown squares, yellow squares, green
squares and big flat blotches of green where there was a forest. I began

<p>
The notion that cubist painting is intimately, even causally, connected
to aerial perspective has become a fixture in scholarly lore about both.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Such a connection has allowed art historians to posit yet another
  technological base or source for cubism's syntax of rupture, while
  celebrants of the aerial view and the aerial photograph invoke the same
  pairing to glamorize the vertical as avant-garde. It is a connection,
  moreover, whose authority is temptingly underwritten by several
  prominent contemporaries of cubism. In a 1921 essay introducing a
  cubist exhibition in Berlin, the critic Waldemar George wrote that
  "cubism is entirely based on the theory of equivalents: an equivalent
  for volume, an equivalent for aerial perspective, an equivalent for
  form. . . . It replaces aerial perspective by an equivalent for the
  third dimension."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  Ernest Hemingway claimed to understand cubist painting in a new way
  when, during his second flight in an airplane, he peered down on
  the patchwork of fields and forests between Paris and the Vosges
  mountains. Descriptions of aerial vistas in Evelyn Waugh's novel
  <i>Vile Bodies</i>  draw on his

<b></b>

accounts of abstract paintings he had seen the previous year at the
Parisian <i>Panorama de l'art contemporain</i>.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Oftenest cited is Gertrude Stein's coupling of aerial perspective
  and cubism in the conclusion of <i>Picasso</i> :



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
But the earth seen from an airplane is something different. So the
twentieth century is not the same as the nineteenth century and it is
very interesting knowing that Picasso has never seen the earth from an
airplane, that being of the twentieth century he inevitably knew that
the earth is not the same as in the nineteenth century, he knew it,
he made it, inevitably he made it different and what he made is a thing
that now all the world can see. When I was in America I for the first
time travelled pretty much all the time in an airplane and when I looked
at the earth I saw all the lines of cubism made at a time when not any
painter had ever gone up in an airplane. I saw there on the earth the
mingling lines of Picasso, coming and going, developing and destroying
themselves, I saw the simple solutions of Braque, I saw the wandering
lines of Masson, yes I saw and once more I knew that a creator is
contemporary, he understands what is contemporary when the contemporaries
do not yet know it, but he is contemporary and as the twentieth century
is a century which sees the earth as no one has ever seen it, the earth
has a splendor that it never has had, and as everything destroys itself
in the twentieth century and nothing continues, so then the twentieth
century has a splendor which is its own and Picasso is of this century,
he has that strange quality of an earth that one has never seen and of
things destroyed as they have never been destroyed. So then Picasso has
his splendor. Yes. Thank you.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In the cases of Hemingway and Waugh, if less so with Stein, one might
be tempted to dismiss the yoking of cubism to aerial perspective as
an instance of writerly agon against painterly innovation, an attempt
to domesticate cubism to a sort of proleptic documentarism through
the assertion of writerly metaphorical powers. But one finds the same
pairing in other quarters as well. By 1918, young British aviators were
being trained to see an avant-garde exhibition unfurling beneath their
cockpits: a First World War Royal Air Force photo atlas for new pilots
used "FUTURIST country" and "CUBIST country" in its taxonomy of aerial
landscapes, alongside more everyday mnemonic headings such as "FRUIT
GROWING" and "PATCHWORK QUILTING."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  And the coupling has been repeated enough in more recent scholarship to
  indicate its durable explanatory, or at least suggestive, power. Martin
  Jay proposes that the First World War earned Stein's designation
  of it as "cubist" principally for the views its pilots had of the
  trench-crossed landscape below them (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#1" name="1"> 1</a>).
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  And Stephen Kern accepts a metaphorical, if not necessarily causal,
  relation between aerial perspective and cubism, summing up the
  similarities thus: "The Cubist reduction of depth, elimination of
  unessential detail, composition with simplified forms, and unification
  of the entire picture surface are pictorial representations of the view
  of the earth's surface from an airplane in flight" (<i>CTS,</i> 245).

<p>
There is something intuitively plausible about an association between
cubist painting and views of the earth from an airplane. Expanding
on Kern's summation, one might add that aerial views of developed,
populous city centers and of cultivated land often replace the
redundant, recursive, seemingly random curvilinearity of organic forms
with rectilinearity, or at least with a certain geometric regularity
and simplicity (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#2" name="2"> 2</a>). One might say that <i>bios</i> surrenders to
<i>logos</i> as the landscape offers itself to be

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 352]</b>

read, not as a dynamic habitat, but as a deposit of human intentionality,
as a planned text. The sharpened lines, clarified structure and geometric
shapes of the planned text, in turn, might be said to resonate with
cubist mechano-morphism. A machine aesthetic can thrive in the air:
from sufficient altitudes, the individual organism dwindles to the
vanishing point, bodies recede to exteriorized and genderless dots
circulating as particles in the fluid dynamics of the urban mass, made
visually contiguous with the material fabric of the city as viewed from
above. Alternately, the body diminishes to a data point in the emerging
statistical epistemes that were cognate with the aerial perspective in
their shared claims to spatially arrayed overviews of an aggregate of
such points. The impression that the earth has become a planar grid for
abstract data plotting is, in turn, visually enhanced by the flatness
of the high-altitude vertical view, with its paradoxical erasure of
the vertical dimension; and that leveling might further suggest cubist
rejections of perspectival convention in favor of a conspicuously
two-dimensional image plane whose depthlessness, like the aerial view's,
was no longer hospitable to the conventional pictorial distinction
between re and ground.

<p>
Yet in other ways, the coupling of cubist painting and aerial perspective
should arouse our skepticism. To begin with, it posits a single visual
correlative for an often divergent group of painters, collapsing a
range of formal, intentional, and ideological distinctions among them. In
addition, it sidelines the movement's infractions of conventional temporal
and spatial syntax, its projection onto a single and circumscribed
image plane of serial apprehensions of its objects. It reduces an only
partially mimetic visual vocabulary to the straightforward mimesis
(or, in Kern's words, the "pictorial representation") of a new vista,
replacing the novelty of the medium with that of the object, while at the
same time substituting a narrative about technologies of representation
with one about technologies of flight. Hemingway and Stein observe that
the earth from an airplane resembles cubist painting, but in formulating
that observation, both really make the reverse assertion: that cubist
painting was a cultural harmonic of, was even indebted to, the view of
the earth from above. Finally, this filiation or affiliation ignores the
fact that airborne viewing was not new to the twentieth century. Though
heavier-than-air flight evidently began with the Wrights in 1903,
lighter-than-air ascents had been taking place since the Montgolfier
balloons went up in 1783. As balloons became safer and more numerous,
the vertical view of the earth was no longer the exclusive privilege of an
aeronautical elite, but accessible to anyone who could afford the modest
price of a commercial ascent. Descriptions of balloon views of cities are
a populous subgenre of nineteenth-century ekphrastic writing, as etchings
and paintings of balloon vistas are of the period's visual culture. If we
are to connect the vocabularies of cubist painting with aeriality at all,
we need to ask what had changed about aerial viewing and its cultural
contexts between the late eighteenth century and the early twentieth.

<p>
One obvious starting point is the invention and fetishization of the
airplane shortly after the turn of the century. The airplane undoubtedly
altered the context of aerial viewing with its greater velocity
and navigability, its louder and more turbulent ride, and its very
unballoonlike aesthetic of loud engine, propeller, struts, wheels, flaps,

<b></b>

levers, instrument panels, bombs, and guns. Thus, when Filippo Marinetti
described how the vertical aerial view demanded a new poetic syntax in
his 1912 "Technical Manifesto of Futurism," he set his epiphany not in
the padded interior of a balloon's wicker gondola but astride the gas
tank of a Voisin biplane, where he had sat vibrating to its internal
combustion engine and listening to the dictations of its propeller.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  If fast, navigable, motor-driven, heavier-than-air flight didn't
  exactly deliver an unprecedented view of the earth, it at least
  provided a different set of procedures by which to achieve
  and manipulate that view and a novel array of sensations to
  accompany it. To the extent vision is informed by the body's full
  sensorium&#8212;mechanical vibration, engine noise, strong wind,
  pressure changes in the ear, nausea induced by changing gravitational
  forces, the euphoria of high speed&#8212;the airplane did alter aerial
  perception. But it was from the coupling of the airplane with the
  camera that the most extreme splendors and modes of destruction,
  to use Stein's words, precipitated. Paul Virilio writes that the
  ambition of most early balloonists "was not so much <i>to fly</i>
  as <i>to see from on high</i>."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  The formulation applies less fully to early aviators, for whom seeing
  from on high was less novel than being able to navigate their swifter
  craft more precisely than aeronauts could steer balloons. Nevertheless,
  this unprecedented degree of navigability in flight did open up the
  uses of aerial photography, which previously had been hamstrung by the
  balloon's captivity to prevailing winds. With its roughly constant
  speed, direction, and altitude, the airplane provided a steerable,
  stable platform from which a photographer could take photos in regular
  series, "covering" an entire area by flying over and photographing it
  in grid patterns at a consistent scale and orientation. Whereas photos
  taken from other airborne platforms (balloons, kites, rockets, even
  pigeons) had never produced much more than haphazard, if tantalizing,
  results, airplane photography was far more exploitable, quickly
  burgeoning in its commercial and military uses and gaining a much
  greater cultural visibility.

<p>
This essay, then, is concerned neither with the airplane itself nor
with the views its pilots and passengers enjoyed, but rather with the
photographic genres, techniques, and discourses that developed in tandem
with early aviation, and with their relation to avant-garde representation
in the first decades of the twentieth century. Though some of the photo
interpretation methods I discuss here were also deployed in interwar
civil contexts, the essay is principally devoted to the techniques
and technical discourse of aerial reconnaissance photography during
World War I. I have chosen the wartime focus partly because it was the
germinal site for airplane photography: the techniques and reflexive
discourse of aerial photography got exported out of their originary
military contexts into their commercial ones, not vice versa, and even
in those commercial contexts they retained a residue of their military
origins. More importantly, the emphasis here on wartime photography arises
from the fact that military reconnaissance was explicitly oriented around
equipping, training, and therefore describing human <i>observers</i>,
which I maintain is also the case with avant-garde representation during
the period. Whereas Stein, Hemingway, and others connected cubism and
the aerial view through their respective visual characteristics, I will
be less concerned here with visual syntax <i>tout court</i> than with
how wartime reconnaissance photographic techniques constructed

<b></b>

and conscripted a new kind of observer, and with how that observer might
be related to the observer imagined by cubism and other modernist forms
of representation. I will also suggest that the nature and objectives of
"interpretation" are refashioned by aerial reconnaissance and avant-garde
representation in similar enough ways to suggest that both refashionings
should be seen as symptomatic of one crisis in the period's dominant
scopic regime.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  My aim in positing the above relationships between aesthetic forms
  and military techniques is neither to aestheticize the work of
  wartime reconnaissance nor to recuperate the viewing of military
  aerial photographs as an avant-garde aesthetic experience. I wish,
  instead, to understand how the spectator conscripted by cubism might be
  cognate with the corresponding re in a military-industrial complex
  usually taken to be as remote as possible from an autochthonous,
  self-legislating, self-delighting aesthetic.

<p>
World War I has long been regarded as the first modern war in the scale
of casualties it produced, in its shift from contained fronts toward
"total war," and in its turn from aristocratic pageantry and honor
codes to technological, depersonalized, even democratized killing. But
a number of recent accounts have characterized the Great War as also
witnessing or catalyzing a crisis in perception. According to Virilio,
"1914 was not only the physical deportation of millions of men to the
fields of battle, it was also, with the apocalypse of the deregulation
of perception, a diaspora of another kind, the moment of panic in which
the American and European masses no longer believed their eyes."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  For Martin Jay, this loss of faith in ocular proof marked the final
  overthrow of the "ancien scopic r&eacute;gime" of ocularcentric
  Cartesian perspectivalism (<i>DE,</i> 212-3). Yet World War I was
  also the most optical war yet, a war in which observation involved no
  longer the reconnaissance and reports of lone scouts on foot, but a
  complex technological matrix: semiautomated aerial cameras obtained
  photographic coverage of the entire front, and the photomosaic maps
  compiled from this coverage were reproduced through industrialized
  techniques and widely disseminated; observers in airplanes and balloons
  reported by Morse lamp and later by wireless telegraph to command
  posts, using the coordinates on gridded aerial photos to direct
  artillery fire; aerial photographic sorties recorded not only the
  enemy's trench and gun placements but the production and movements
  of weapons, goods, and armies far behind the front. Contemporary
  accounts of this aspect of the war bear little obvious witness to a
  crisis in ocularcentrism, tending rather to celebrate the accuracy
  of the Allied reconnaissance matrix, and particularly its airborne
  components, as indispensable to victory. Walter Raleigh's 1922
  encomium to the scopic power of aerial reconnaissance is typical,
  exhibiting if anything a renewed faith in the power of ocular proof:
  "Reconnaissance, or observation, can never be superseded; knowledge
  comes before power; and the air is first of all a place to see from."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  Such rhetoric may well be compensatory for a felt crisis in visual
  perception, but if so, we need to understand how such a crisis
  could have been initiated, or at least accelerated, by the very
  reconnaissance modes that encomiasts celebrated as infallibly precise,
  revealing, potent.

<p>
To this end, we first need to become familiar with the specific terms
in which aerial "recco" photography was consecrated, in Alan Sekula's
phrase, as the "triumph of applied

<b></b>

realism" during and immediately following the First World War.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  In essence, aerial photos were seen to surpass all other visual
  forms in their accuracy, information saturation, and immunity to
  rhetorical distortion. "Everything revealed in an aerial photograph
  means something, and in warfare margins of error are neither safe
  nor officially acknowledged," a British interwar textbook on aerial
  photography asserts of wartime photographic interpretation; "Accuracy
  alone was not enough."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  If interpretation might exceed the standard of mere "accuracy,"
  it was because an image form in which "everything means something"
  already contained data in excess of that standard, approaching the real
  in its disregard for informational economy. Having canonized aerial
  photography as a paradise of pure signification, the same text goes
  on to speculate that the aerial photograph might eventually succeed
  more abstract survey genres, replacing the map's imprecise semiosis
  with its unmediated plenitude:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
It is possible that the time may come when for cadastral and ordinance
purposes the aerial photographic survey will be accepted as a map
after the customary references already provided by drawn maps have
been added. Whereas trees and the like are illustrated on the drawn
map by cadastral signs presented in positions that call for the use of
imagination or reference to the key in the body of the map, vertical
aerial photographs reveal the formation, lay-out and even nature of
forestry and other terrestrial marks, thus giving a true topographical
impression of the earth's surface. . . . open spaces are recorded in
detail, and waterways and coastlines revealed by the aerial photograph
do not lie. [<i>CS</i>, 13]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Replacing the generalized symbol of a tree with the image of the
particular tree, the abstracted red line with the image of the road in
question, aerial photos would eliminate the need for "imagination or
reference to the key in the body of the map"&#8212;that is, the need for
decoding the semiotics of the map. Having initially existed in imagination
only, the bird's eye view had, in its photographic embodiment, refined
both semiosis and "imagination" out of its circuits altogether, arriving
at a nearly self-identical relation with the real. Such a relation
was seen to resist the tendentious motives of photographer, viewer, or
subject, and thus to guarantee the factual status and accuracy of the
image. The photographer Edward Steichen, who finished the war as chief
of the U.S. Air Service Photographic Section, called aerial photographs
"an unequalled historical document of the great war. They represent
neither opinions nor prejudice, but indisputable facts."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  In his memoirs, Steichen claimed that the unrivalled precision of
  reconnaissance photography roused him from the impressionistic reverie
  of his early painterly photographs, awakening him to the virtues of
  a sharper-edged, more accessible image (i.e., the capitalist realism
  of his postwar work for Madison Avenue).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  To take accounts like Steichen's, or Winchester and Wills's, at
  face value is to find in aerial reconnaissance photography the
  last bastion of na&iuml;ve realism, and during a period more often
  celebrated for its extreme departures from the realist matrix of
  Cartesian perspectivalism.

<p>
Looking at wartime aerial photography in its technical and discursive
contexts, however, one finds that such realist claims attempted
simultaneously to ward off the supposed

<b></b>

disrements of the contemporary avant-garde and to downplay the
equally disring and exaggerative ways in which aerial photographs
were actually decoded and deployed. In their more technical chapters
on photographic interpretation, the same manuals that prophesied the
eventual replacement of maps with aerial photographs acknowledged the
absurdity of that prophecy. During the First World War, a whole school
of aerial photographic interpretation grew up to extract information
from recco photos, which, though they did not necessarily lie, also
did not represent the truth in a way that was immediately legible or
self-evident to the untrained viewer. Winchester and Wills write:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The interpretation of aerial photographs was, of course, a real problem
and one of vast importance. It meant considerable training of men of
high intelligence, and at first much of the training depended upon
guess-work as well as deduction, for it was only by an ever-increasing
experience that the interpreters could learn the significance of
new details and classify their deductions until they had a reliable
photographic key or code upon which to work and through which to teach
new recruits. The smallest detail had to be accounted for in terms of
military importance. Nothing was too slight to escape the attention of
those whose difficult task it was to provide rational explanations of
the photographs. [<i>CS</i>, 8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
If a signal that is exhaustively pure requires an equally exhaustive
regime of interpretation, then that signal stands revealed as already
coded. Aerial photographs possessed the conceit of laying reality bare
by their deadly accuracy, their vertical penetration, their plenitude or
even excess of detail, and their ability to reveal facts, objects, and
strategic intentions not otherwise accessible. But this realist conceit
was mitigated by an accompanying insistence on the defamiliarizing
power of the vertical view, on the sense that even the reality beneath
the enemy's camouflage was self-camouflaging, and on the need for new
codes by which a highly trained interpretive elite could decipher the
camouflage of the real. This new interpretive corps also had to learn to
rectify the broad range of distortions to which aerial photographs were
susceptible&#8212;distortions resulting from airplane vibration and tilt,
fluctuations in altitude and scale, relief displacement, imperfect lenses
and shutters, film warping, paper shrinkage or expansion, aerial haze. And
as the following section illustrates, reconnaissance photos not only were
subject to distortion but, in their single most strategically crucial
use&#8212;aerial stereoscopy&#8212;actually required distortion to be
legible. In exploiting the structural idiosyncrasies of aerial photos and
human optical anatomy, aerial stereoscopy required that photo interpreters
learn more than a new "photographic key or code"; they had to relearn
depth perception, retraining their optical reflexes to see, in effect,
through the surrogate eyes of a virtual colossus. Calling forth relief
effects in hallucinogenic exaggeration from flat images, the stereoscope
enabled its trained users to perform seemingly preternatural acts of
perception and interpretation. But the stereoscope and the reconnaissance
methods in which it played an essential role did not, strangely,
produce observers who believed in the panoptical power attributed to
them by propaganda and triumphalist historical accounts. Because the
new intelligence techniques exploited rather than denied the limitations
and site specificity of perception, they

<b></b>

produced observers who were confronted constantly with the spatial and
temporal contingency of human vision and were therefore more willing
to extend it by subjecting their bodies, their perceptual habits, even
their memories and their emotions, to redisciplining and insertion within
a massive optical prosthesis.

<p>
Of course, the stereoscope's use in World War I aerial reconnaissance
was not the first arena in which it schematized and capitalized
on the site-specific elements of vision. Nor should the device be
understood deterministically as a technological agent of philosophical
or cultural crisis. Jonathan Crary has characterized the much earlier
parlor stereoscope, which became a popular domestic curiosity around
1850, as paradigmatic of the dominant status of the observer during the
nineteenth century, much as the camera obscura was for the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. The stereoscope, Crary argues, was neither
the cause of theories of vision or crises of visual faith, nor simply
a haphazard invention of the 1830s; it was, rather, a crystallization
of contemporary demands, anxieties, and developments in physiological
optics, epistemology, aesthetics, mechanics, and political economy. It
embodied the transition from a geometrical optics to a physiological one,
relocating the "events" of vision from an empirically verifiable outside
world to the more idiosyncratic domain of the body. At the same time,
it symptomatized the decline of classical associations of sight with
clear and distinct perception, and the rise of theories of subjective
vision, which reimagined the observer as the site as well as the subject
of perceptual inscription. Crary writes:<br />



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The stereoscopic viewer sees neither the identity of a copy nor the
coherence guaranteed by the frame of a window. Rather, what appears is
the technical reconstitution of an already reproduced world fragmented
into two nonidentical models, models that precede any experience of their
subsequent perception as unified or tangible. The institutionalization
of this decentered observer and the stereoscope's dispersed and multiple
sign severed from a point of external reference indicate a greater break
with a classical observer than that which occurs later in the century
in the realm of painting. The stereoscope signals an eradication of
"the point of view" around which, for several centuries, meanings had
been assigned reciprocally to an observer and the object of his or her
vision. There is no longer the possibility of perspective under such a
technique of beholding. The relation of observer to image is no longer to
an object quantified in relation to a position in space, but rather to
two dissimilar images whose position simulates the anatomical structure
of the observer's body.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Particularly in its earliest incarnations, the stereoscope foregrounded
the process by which the human visual apparatus melds dissimilar images
into an illusion of three-dimensional unity and thus schematized human
depth perception as a perpetual <i>effect</i> of the viewer's physiology,
rather than a <i>fact</i> about how the world "was." Additionally, it
dissociated touch and sight, creating depth effects that looked palpable
but were not; having effected this dissociation, it subordinated touch
to sight, making tangibility

<b></b>

seem a hallucination or special effect of optics. And it explicitly
enlisted its viewer in the work of producing a realistic image, insisting
that the viewer was less the user of a tool than a component in a visual
apparatus, standing in a relation of contiguity rather than mastery,
of metonymy rather than metaphor, with the device. In thus constructing
its user as a part of the mechanism, the stereoscope stood in a metonymic
relation to industrial modes of production, which transformed the worker
from an agent of tool use to one of many components in a mechanized
manufacturing process. Though the stereoscope has often been treated as
a crucial representational technology of realism in its uncanny power
of making objects seem tangibly present within a deep image space,
Crary's analysis suggests that, to the contrary, it embodied a complex
of increasingly nonveridical theories of vision that a na&iuml;ve realism
would eventually be unable to assimilate.

<p>
As a popular novelty, the nineteenth-century stereoscope performed
verisimilitude as a sort of parlor trick. Through it, viewers watched
pairs of adjacent flat images&#8212;typically depicting cluttered
interiors, exotic landscapes, teeming city scenes&#8212;fused and
jutting into a compressed three-dimensionality comprised of distal and
proximate depth planes (. <a href="10.2saint_res.html#3" name="3">3</a> and <a href="10.2saint_res.html#4" name="4">4</a>). In its First World War military
rehabilitation, the stereoscope was conscripted into a different role:
it became "the worst foe of camouflage," a device for decoding the
enemy's visual encryptions of the landscape.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  Owing to the limitations of human optical geometry, neither unaided
  visual observation from the air nor single aerial photographs proved
  much good against camouflage or decoys, two optical tactics that
  bedeviled reconnaissance observers during the first year of the
  war. By the summer of 1915, however, camera semiautomation enabled
  pilots to take a series of aerial photographs close enough together
  that the ground depicted in adjacent photos in the series overlapped.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  By putting these overlapping pairs of aerial photos under the
  stereoscope, photo interpreters could use the device's virtual
  stereopsis to tell bomb craters from mounds and trenches from
  embankments. They could distinguish flat decoy bridges and aircraft
  from real ones; they could see through some kinds of camouflage and
  forest covering to the objects hidden beneath. And if the overlapping
  photo pairs were taken at wide enough spatial intervals, interpreters
  could even see part of the ground underneath bridges. By conjuring the
  impression of elevation from flat images of a remote and miniaturized
  surface, aerial stereoscopy put the photographic interpreter above, and
  seemingly inside, a three-dimensional scale model of the landscape. In
  a sense, the stereoscope also put the landscape inside the viewer:
  like its domestic predecessor, aerial stereoscopy depended for its
  effects as much on the viewer's optical anatomy as on the device's
  placement of overlapping photo pairs, fusing the stereoscope and
  the photo interpreter into a single viewing apparatus. By the
  midpoint of World War I, aerial stereoscopy had become a staple in
  the reconnaissance repertoire of decryptive technologies aimed at
  exposing the enemy's secrecy to a "pitiless publicity" (<i>AP,</i>
  18). <i>Popular Mechanics</i> would later name the stereoscope "the
  deadliest weapon in the war."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Given the stereoscope's vaunted power of peering around corners, making
the minutest photographic details betray the concealed intentions of
the enemy, one is hardly

<b></b>

surprised to find the wartime aerial photographic interpreter
hailed repeatedly as a detective. In his 1920 textbook on <i>Airplane
Photography</i>, Herbert Ives describes military photo interpretation as
"a task of minute study and deduction worthy of Sherlock Holmes." Harold
Porter writes that once an interpreter has scaled a photograph, "there
are only two steps&#8212;to see what is on the photograph, and to make
your conclusions. Sherlock Holmes would have adored it."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  Arthur Conan Doyle's detective, we should recall, straddles the
  threshold between a form of realism and a natural supernaturalism. In
  his self-representations, he is merely a practitioner-advocate of
  simple veridical technologies (observation, deduction) that allow
  him to restore dislodged objects and deranged subjects to their
  proper domains, proportions, and narrative functions. But at the
  same time, he is one in whom these technologies are so extremely
  realized&#8212;sometimes through his willingness to distort or even
  reject "normal" scopic and deductive regimes&#8212;that they become
  "powers," giving him a hotline to the real so direct that it appears
  magical.

<b></b>

<p>
Like their fictional patron saint, aerial photographic detectives from
World War I on arrived at their documentary narratives about the location,
circulation, and strategic significance of military resources by way
of a detour through magic, in this case that of an optical trickery
that allowed them to decipher the enemy's visual codes by way of a
counterdistortion or counterillusion: hyperstereoscopy. For Victorian
parlor stereoscopes, photographic stereopairs were taken through
two adjacent lenses whose focal points were the same distance apart
as the human pupils, i.e., about 2.75 inches. Reproducing the body's
interpupillary distance, this <i>orthostereoscopy</i> retained the relief
proportions of "normal" depth perception by replicating the dimensions
of human parallax, the apparent displacement of foreground in relation to
background when viewed from two different points. <i>Hyperstereoscopy</i>
occurs whenever stereopairs are taken from points whose separation exceeds
the interpupillary distance. Because unaided human stereopsis drops out
at distances over fifteen hundred or two thousand feet, hyperstereoscopy
became the rule rather than the exception in aerial reconnaissance. From
an aircraft flying at even a modest altitude, the ground is too remote for
the naked eyes' sightlines to converge significantly enough to experience
stereopsis&#8212;hence the apparent flatness of vertical aerial views.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  However, taking stereopairs with an interaxial separation greater than
  2.75 inches could compensate for the increased distance between viewer
  and object by increasing parallax accordingly. Hyperstereoscopy enabled
  human observers to see as if through eyes set farther apart than
  their own, effectively readjusting the scale of the observer's optical
  geometry in relation to a remote object so that depth perception was
  once again possible. Separated from the ground by giant distances, the
  observer swelled back to proportions commensurate with stereoscopic
  vision by seeing through the eyes of a giant. This virtual gigantism
  effectively rescaled landscapes&#8212;usually so remote as to cancel
  stereopsis&#8212;into interiors with considerable relief effects,
  domesticating high-altitude views of fronts and cities by giving them
  the tangibility of a cluttered, tchotchke-strewn drawing room. Yet
  the actual images read by photo interpreters were minuscule, often in
  scales of 1:25,000 or smaller. Reconnaissance observers, therefore,
  grew accustomed to a vertiginous elasticity of scale, oscillating
  between the scale of their own bodies, the minute scale of the aerial
  photo, and the colossal scale of hyperstereopsis.

<p>
During World War I, aerial stereoscopic pairs used for reconnaissance
were not taken simultaneously by a dual-lens camera but diachronically by
an automated single-lens device, and were then paired up later under the
interpreter's stereoscope. These temporally serial photographs were shot
at intervals of 14.5 seconds from a plane flying at around sixty miles
per hour, so that stereopairs were taken with an average interaxial
distance of 1,250 feet, over 5,400 times the human interpupillary
distance (<i>AC,</i> 53) (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#5" name="5"> 5</a>). Such large multiples meant that the
apparent relief was not just restored up to the "normal" dimensions of
more proximate objects, but exaggerated well past it (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#6" name="6"> 6</a>). Initially
this exaggeration and the spatiotemporal interval that caused it were
technical side effects: the slow reloading speeds of semiautomatic cameras
resulted in the plane's covering a substantial distance between shots. But
that accidental distortion crucially improved the vertical legibility,
and thus the strategic utility, of

<b></b>

aerial stereoscopy. Beaumont Newhall, who worked as a U.S. military photo
interpreter during World War II, describes the interpretive advantages
of hyperstereoscopy as they were discovered during the Great War:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Unlike those stereoscopic views, once so popular, which give a convincing,
"realistic" illusion of depth, pairs of overlapping aerial photographs
give an exaggerated, highly distorted sense of height. Hummocks
become hills, gulches seem to be deep chasms, and ordinary houses,
skyscrapers. This exaggeration helps the interpreter: a machine gun

<b></b>

emplacement seems to rise up from the ground; he can look under the
bridge as well as on it; he can count long trains of freight cars and
see the crumbling walls of bombed targets. [<i>AC,</i> 53]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Aerial stereoscopy bestowed a seemingly supernatural, Asmodean power of
seeing around, under, and through structures from above. It did so not by
restoring orthostereoscopic verisimilitude but by departing willfully from
it. The truly resourceful photographic interpreter was not held back by a
need for lifelike dimensions and elevations, but instead wrung the neck
of realism and, in return, gained entry to a virtual landscape at once
"highly distorted," in that the apparent proportions of its binocular
space had been altered, and more starkly legible. Here we should remember
that aerial photography was generally touted by its practitioners as the
representational mode most nearly approaching the asymptote of the real. A
tension existed between the putative realism of aerial photography on
the one hand and, on the other, its resistance to full decryption except
through the miraculous distortion of hyperstereoscopy. This tension
registers in interpretive manuals and textbooks written during and after
World War I, often taking shape in embarrassed equivocations:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Stereograms made with too large exposure intervals show exaggerated
relief. Yet this is often no objection. It is indeed rather an advantage
if we wish to bring objects of interest to notice. Consequently, so long
as the exaggeration of relief is not offensive, the permissible limits of
exposure interval are pretty large. Actually, the eye tolerates such great
deviations from strictly normal conditions that satisfactory stereoscopic
effects are obtained for pictures viewed at very different distances
from the focal length of the taking lens, and with the axes of the eyes
parallel or even diverging, although there is some strain whenever focus
and convergence points differ. On the whole, therefore, it may be said
that the conditions above laid down for correct relief are only a normal,
to be approximated as nearly as is practicable. [<i>AP,</i> 337-8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
By tentatively allowing exaggerated relief as "no objection" so long
as it is "not offensive," Ives relativizes the "normal" dimensions of
human vision as "<i>a</i> normal," as a baseline from which to depart
in favor of distortions that allowed more data to be extracted from the
plenum of the aerial photo. Normal dimensions are marginalized here as a
question of mere taste (the baseline from which we judge what is and is
not "offensive"), while strategic utility is brought forward as the more
pressing criterion; the perceptual extremes underwritten by military
exigency eclipse the notion of a "true" vision centered in a human
optical norm and, in the process, mine more truth from the image than
human-centered vision could. Since any appreciable stereoscopic vision at
high altitudes is itself the result of a distortion that compensates for
the limits of unaided stereopsis, then the former "truth" of biological
stereoscopy stands revealed as increasingly <i>hypostereoscopic</i> as
distances increase, requiring a complex system of prosthetic technologies
(airplane, camera, stereoscope) to restore it to a now-destabilized
normal.

<p>
Yet even as it relativized the dimensions and limitations of the body's
stereopsis, aerial stereoscopy insisted in other ways on the bodiliness
and spatial contingency of

the observer. The pervasive assumption that aerial photos present
"totalizing" views of their subjects ignores the fact that the
strategic utility of aerial photos lay in their exploitable spatial
specificity. Vertical aerial photographs depict perfectly vertical
views only of objects directly beneath the center of the lens; elevated
objects not along that axis lean radially away from the center, and
to a greater degree the farther away they are from that nadir; in a
sense, then, vertical photos grow increasingly oblique toward their
peripheries (fish-eye lenses merely exaggerate this phenomenon). Though
this relief displacement presented a problem for joining overlapping
photos into mosaic-maps, it was a sine qua non for aerial stereopsis:
the stereoscope fused the distinct relief displacements of its stereopairs
into an apparent three-dimensionality. However, in order to perceive that
stereoptic effect properly, interpreters had to factor in another defining
characteristic of the aerial photo: shadows. Early interpretive manuals
insist that in order to preserve the light vectors of the photographic
image, aerial stereopairs must be positioned with the shadows falling
away from the observer's light source, and thus toward the observer. The
observer who failed to reproduce the photograph's light vectors under
the stereoscope would find relief inverted in a <i>pseudoscopic</i>
effect: holes would appear as mounds, and trenches as walls (. <a href="10.2saint_res.html#7" name="7">7</a>
and <a href="10.2saint_res.html#8" name="8">8</a>). Sometimes pseudoscopic effects could arise from hemispheric
conditioning as well. Harold Porter's <i>Aerial Observation</i> 
recounts how, during World War I, a Brazilian pilot and reconnaissance
trainee misread shell craters as German gun emplacements on an aerial
photo: "The Brazilian aviator was reared of course in the southern
hemisphere where the sun is always north and where the shadows fall to
the south. He saw in the picture just the reverse of what the Britishers
saw, and he had not received enough training to know that he might
[<i>sic</i>] always adjust his mind to the difference." Porter goes on
to express doubts about the accuracy of the story, which he views as
"too good to be true, but it demonstrates the point perfectly. First,
orient your photograph."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  In this case, however, "orientation" meant more than aligning the photo
  coverage with mapped space and compass points, or even recreating
  original light conditions. It was seen to entail a reprogramming
  of the individual interpreter's idiosyncratic perceptual circuits
  in accordance with a hemispherically specific theater of war. In
  respect to relief displacement, shadow orientation, and hemisphere,
  aerial stereoscopy insisted not only on a spatially contingent camera,
  but on an incarnated observer, one who had to be properly oriented
  toward light, image, and perceptual habits while being lowered, so to
  speak, into the virtual cockpit of the stereo image. Borrowing a term
  from linguistics, we might say that aerial stereoscopy was spatially
  <i>deictic</i>, that is, explicitly cognizant of the context-specific
  "here" that partly constitutes the act of seeing. Far from delivering
  a disembodied but immediately legible overview of its objects, aerial
  stereophotography did as much to expose the spatial and biological
  contingency of its observers as it did to lay bare the terrain it
  depicted. A scopic regime initially celebrated, and later criticized,
  as totalizing was useful in proportion as it exploited&#8212;and
  in the process, foregrounded&#8212;the radically deictic aspects of
  depth perception and of seeing generally.

<b></b>

<p>
But if aerial stereoscopy did not provide the promised totalizing views
of the earth's surface, it compensated in the extreme demands it made
of its observers. As Porter writes, quoting one of his First World War
photo interpretation instructors, "To interpret an aerial photograph is to
reverse the habits of a lifetime" (<i>AO,</i> 177). As we have seen, this
reversal of habits meant much more than learning to recognize trenches,

<b></b>

gun emplacements, and runways in a vertical high-altitude photo. It
involved the systematic redisciplining of observers' perceptual circuits
in relation to the narrow requirements of a complex prosthetic optical
regime. Before they could realign their bodies with the sightlines
and shadowlines of stereopairs, observers first had to learn to use
a stereoscope, or at least to use it in the hyperstereoscopic mode
demanded by reconnaissance work (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#9" name="9"> 9</a>). This was not as simple as
looking through a pair of binoculars, a magnifying glass, or a jeweler's
loupe. As one World War II-era manual puts it, observers had to learn to
"acquire voluntary control over a previously involuntary reflex," or,
in more precise optical terms, to dissociate the visual reflexes of
convergence and association, reflexes that usually operate in concert.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  In essence, observers had to focus their eyes on images just a
  few inches away; but they had to prevent the sightlines of left
  and right eye from converging on a single close-up image as they
  would in unaided stereopsis, instead keeping each eye directed at
  its corresponding stereopair (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#0" name="0"> 10</a>). Not everyone could achieve
  artificial stereopsis, and even those who eventually succeeded had
  to practice, often experiencing eyestrain and headaches along the
  way. Another 1940s reconnaissance manual counsels patience, noting that
  "many persons have mastered the trick only after having worked 15 to
  20 hours with stereo-prints." But it consoles its readers with the
  promise that their efforts will reward them with an almost violent 3-D
  epiphany: "When coincidence of the photographs is secured, as above,
  the relief should seem to come right up and hit you."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Firsthand accounts of aerial stereoscopy by Great War interpreters are
scarce, but their Second World War counterparts&#8212;several of them
officers in the British Women's Auxiliary Air Force&#8212;used very
similar methods, and wrote memoirs documenting their first encounters
with the stereoscope in the context of reconnaissance work. These
accounts vividly describe the epiphanic moment of stereo fusion,
but they are equally vivid in recounting what personal associations
that moment precipitated or displaced. Former WAAF photo interpreter
Constance Babington-Smith describes her first successful stereoscopic
session during the early months of World War II:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I stood [the stereoscope] above a pair of prints as I had seen some of the
others doing. I could see two images, not one, and there really did not
seem much point. It was much simpler to work with an ordinary magnifying
glass. I edged the two prints backward and forward a bit&#8212;still
two images; and then suddenly the thing happened, the images fused,
and the buildings in the photograph shot up toward me so that I almost
drew back. It was the same sort of feeling of triumph and wonder that
I remember long ago when I first stayed up on a bicycle without someone
holding on behind. From then on interpretation was much easier.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Babington-Smith would play a key role in British intelligence efforts
against the German aircraft industry and <i>Vergeltungswaffen</i>,
or "revenge weapons," the V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. But her
first artificial stereopsis triggered memories of childhood rather
than prophecies about strategic detective work. Her WAAF colleague,
Ursula Powys-Lybbe, writes how, in peering down through the scope, she
also gazed back in time at her own childhood, except that here it is a
childhood in which the

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 367]</b>

stereoscope itself had played a role. The device acts as both a purveyor
and an object of nostalgia:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Sometimes, when I was a small girl, a treasured box of glass slides would
be brought out accompanied by a wooden viewer with two black eyepieces,
and I would be allowed to put a slide into the viewer and stare through
the eyepieces at a fairy-tale world of sparkling snow, high mountains
and dark trees&#8212;then suddenly and breath-takingly, my mother and
father were standing like real people and looking at me&#8212;not flat
people as in an ordinary photograph. The slides had been taken during
my parents' honeymoon in Switzerland.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
That childish thrill was felt by everyone who, for the first time managed
to shuffle a stereo pair of aerial photographs into the correct position
in the viewer. It might have taken a little time, and you felt convinced
that something was wrong with your eyes, and you strained your muscles
and tried squinting and then magic! Shapes in plan were transformed into
real-life ships or churches or bridges. You begged for more prints,
and like the child with its new plaything, you spent a half-hour in a
wonderland of discovery.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In its reconnaissance application, the stereoscope's power lay not just
in making the enemy's intentions seem legible in the landscape, but in
reawakening the observers' personal associations with the medium and
channeling them toward the ends of military intelligence. These observers
had encountered its technological forerunner, the parlor stereoscope, in
another world&#8212;in peacetime, in childhood, in domestic spaces where
stereograms embodied and catalyzed longing for the past, for possession
of a toy-sized world, for escape to exotic locales. By appropriating
the same optical technology for reconnaissance, aerial stereoscopy wrote
over its observers' first associations; after the war, they would never
again regard the stereoscope simply as a portal to personal nostalgia or
reverie. But while they squinted through its eyepieces at 3-D images of
tiny docklands, factories, airfields, and launch platforms, the device
mobilized their affective ties to its former uses, imbuing aerial views
of military and industrial sites with the glamour of magic, fantasy,
wonder, and play.

<p>
The stereoscopic image also camouflaged its own mode of reproduction
through the impression of palpable immediacy it conferred on its
objects. Amplified by the brief tactical currency of the photos,
the image's aura of presence insisted urgently on the here and now
of interpretation, collapsing the distance its constituent photos
had actually traveled from the site they depicted to the observer's
scope. That distance was not only spatial and temporal but technological
and industrial as well: once the camera plane had landed safely, the
cartridges of exposed film were rushed through a technically cutting-edge
process of accelerated mass reproduction. Allan Sekula describes this
process of development and dissemination:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The making of these reconnaissance prints was one of the first instances
of virtual assembly-line image production. (Henry Ford's first automobile
assembly-line became operative only in 1914.) The establishment of this
method of production grew out of demands for resolution, volume, and
immediacy. No method of reproduction but direct printing from the original
negative would hold the detail necessary for reconnaissance purposes.

<b></b>

Large numbers of prints from a single negative had to be made for
distribution throughout the hierarchy of command. In addition, the
information in prints dated very rapidly. Under these circumstances,
efficiency depended on a thorough-going division of labor and a virtually
continuous speedup of the work process. Printers worked in unventilated,
makeshift darkrooms; 20 workers might produce as many as 1,500 prints
in an hour, working 16-hour shifts.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As one terminus of this industrialized developing process, reconnaissance
interpreters belonged to a kind of consumer vanguard, benefiting from
techniques of photographic mass production that had not yet reached
consumers in civil society. Installed in comparatively safe and
well-organized facilities, they were insulated from the spectrum of
violence involved in obtaining and developing the photos, a spectrum
that included not only dead pilots and wrecked camera planes, but the
exploitive use of conscript labor to ensure the tactical currency and
bulk dissemination of the photos. At the same time, the observers'
status as professional interpreters of industrially mass-produced
images, along with the esoteric nature of their calculations and
surveillance, helped conceal the fact that they also belonged to one of
several classes of worker within the perception-and-targeting machine of
military intelligence. And like most of the workers in the reconnaissance
production line, they learned to experience extended shifts, repetitive
labor, physical strain, and insulation from the violence their "product"
recorded and facilitated, as a rare species of privilege.

<p>
If the glamour of the interpreters' work exceeded that of developers
and even pilots, it did so because of their singular position within the
power/knowledge grid of military intelligence. As we have seen, aerial
stereoscopy, like the general work of photo interpretation to which it
belonged, was situated within a professional narrative of forgetting,
relearning, practice, and eventual mastery&#8212;a narrative of election
and initiation into a top secret coterie, heavily defended by codes and
shibboleths. It was a narrative that consolidated the identity of an
elite interpretive school, one whose power lay not in the mere ability
to command, but in the more rarefied capacity of producing the knowledge
that would inform the commanders&#8212;recall Walter Raleigh's boast that
"Reconnaissance, or observation, can never be superseded; knowledge comes
before power; and the air is first of all a place to see from." Having
gazed with childlike fascination into the miniaturized wonderland beneath
their stereoscopes, the colleagues of Babington-Smith and Powys-Lybbe,
like their Great War predecessors, produced the maps and memos that would,
in turn, direct the Allied bombs. After the missions, they would confirm
the destruction of the same enchanting objects that had held them in a
reverie of detection. In confirming how their detective work had led to
the alteration or annihilation of the terrain and structures recorded
in reconnaissance photos, observers also confirmed the alteration of
their own perceptual systems. To attain stereovision, they had learned
to dissociate their optical reflexes of convergence and accommodation,
in the process retraining their bodies to become contiguous with an
elaborate weapons system that began by recording, identifying, and
interpreting its objects, and ended by targeting and finally destroying
them. They had become acclimated to a vertigo of scale, learning to be
at least three perceptual sizes at once. Most

<b></b>

chillingly, they had retrained themselves affectively so that an
optical medium formerly invested in childhood, memory, genealogy,
and fantasy could retain the force of that affective tie, but refocus
it on the surveillance and obliteration of military, industrial, and
eventually civilian targets. In this respect, the observer-interpreters
themselves&#8212;their bodies, their reflexes, their mnemonic
associations, their affective investments&#8212;were the secondary
targets of their own reconnaissance work.

Observing Cubism
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In turning now to consider the relationships between Great War perceptual
vocabularies and cubist ones, we are entering a well-cultivated
critical terrain, one in which cubism has been seen as anticipating or
influencing wartime phenomena as diverse as psychological fragmentation,
the rectilinearity of the trench environment, the deprivileging of
perspectival centers, and spatial disorientation, along with temporal
acceleration, dilation, and rupture. Some of the cubists themselves saw
elements of the Great War's perceptual repertoire emanating from their
work. Gertrude Stein recalled being with Picasso, on the Boulevard Raspail
during the early months of the war, when he first saw camouflage painted
on a truck: "It was at night, we had heard of camouflage but we had not
yet seen it and Picasso amazed looked at it and then cried out, yes it
is we who made it, that is cubism" (<i>P,</i> 18). More conventional
accounts of the origins of camouflage point to a need to conceal troops,
weapons, and supplies from longer-range guns and the extended optical
range of the enemy's airborne reconnaissance, but the pragmatism of
that need does not rule out the deployment of a cubist visual syntax in
meeting it. Stephen Kern cites at least one account of a direct descent
from cubism to camouflage: Lucien-Victor Guirand de Sc&eacute;vola, an
artilleryman who became the first French <i>camoufleur</i>, claimed that
"In order to totally deform objects, I employed the means Cubists used
to represent them," a decision that resulted in his hiring painters who,
"because of their special vision, had an aptitude for denaturing any
kind of form whatsoever."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  Putatively developed to express a manifold but no less "real" or
  "essential" notion of perception, cubism had been drafted into
  a military function whose semiotic operations&#8212;encryption
  versus decryption, nature versus denaturing, form versus
  deformation&#8212;were far more binary than its own appeared to
  be. Stein wrote that "war is only a publicity agent which makes
  every one know what has happened"&#8212;that is, war foregrounds the
  perceptual sea changes that have already occurred in the culture at
  large and registered in its artistic vanguards (<i>P,</i> 45). If this
  is so, the Great War either caricatured cubism in publicizing it or
  exposed the fact that cubism had, from its inception, possessed an
  encryptive function that suited it to the oppositional perceptual
  space of the battlefield. In the latter case, the Great War would
  have been cubist only insofar as cubism was already combat-ready.

<p>
But if camouflage was among the war's publicizations of cubist innovation,
how could the reconnaissance techniques that helped prompt the invention
of camouflage, and that were subsequently dubbed its "worst foe," be
said to share a perceptual etiology with cubism?<br />
As we have seen, aerial photography was initially celebrated as capturing

<b></b>

a plenitude of accurate data, as the photographic genre whose content
was least contaminated by rhetoric. By contrast, cubist painting was
received as extending the impressionist, postimpressionist, and fauvist
disjunctions of object and depiction, pushing representation toward the
condition of pure, nonmimetic, code. Though we have also seen that aerial
reconnaissance photos were far more coded, contingent, and "produced"
than is generally recognized, they still operated within an intelligence
context whose legitimizing narrative was one of panoptical realism. That
context used technologically enhanced modes of seeing to translate raw
visual data into targeting data, progressively narrowing the gap between
perception and destruction. Cubist painting might be said to enact, or
at least testify to, the violent refraction, attenuation, dismemberment,
and flattening of the subjects named by its often conventional, even
academic work titles (<i>Violin</i>, <i>Female Nude</i>, <i>Still
Life with Violin and Pitcher</i>, <i>Guitar on Table</i>). The 1915
critical complaint that Duchamp's <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i>
resembled "an explosion in a shingle factory" testified, at least,
to this apparent representational violence, one that seems consonant
with the violent and changeful period (1907-1914) during which cubism
initially flourished. But can one really go so far as to link the
harmonic and representational violence of cubism to reconnaissance
techniques used to organize physical violence against an enemy army
and military-industrial complex?

<p>
By the above characterizations, the realist tenets of reconnaissance will
seem, at most, to be a curative response to the perceptual disorder
of cubism. The two would be etiologically related, then, only in
the sense that a disorder and its treatment can be said to share an
etiology. But we have also seen that the hyperrealist claims made on
behalf of reconnaissance were accompanied by an internal recognition
that camouflage&#8212;a distortion or concealment of an object's visual
signature&#8212;was the general rather than the exceptional case of
vision, and that countering it involved not so much undoing distortion
as offering a counterdistortion, one that manifestly did not restore or
recuperate the real. In this respect, we might say that reconnaissance
administered not a medicinal dose of truth, but rather "a lie that makes
us realize truth, at least the truth that is given us to understand."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  Picasso said this of art, and of cubism in particular; his recognition
  of the provisional nature of realizable "truth" has the syntax of
  an afterthought, but insofar as it acknowledges the contingency of
  perception, it articulates a generative condition of both cubism
  and Great War reconnaissance. I have described this condition above
  as the culmination of a nineteenth-century antiocularcentrism in
  physiological optics, epistemology, and aesthetic production, a
  current of thought crystallized in the parlor stereoscope. By 1907
  this deconsecration of vision and visual metaphors had been more
  recently emphasized by Nietzsche and Bergson, who helped bring about
  what Martin Jay has schematized as a threefold revision of vision:
  the detranscendentalization of perspective, the recorporealization
  of the cognitive subject, and the revalorization of time over space
  (<i>DE,</i> 187). Though aerial reconnaissance might be assumed to
  reject any such deconsecration of ocular proof, we have seen that
  instead it capitalized on decentered optics and temporal parallax. And
  though cubism certainly responded to antiocular epistemology, it often

<b></b>

did so in surprisingly eye-minded ways, preserving at least the metaphor
of stereopsis in attempting to tell the story of depth, if never quite
to reproduce its effects. In fact, by projecting onto a single picture
plane many facets of an object not simultaneously visible to the eye
(tops next to bottoms, backs adjacent to fronts), cubism made its own bid
to see beneath bridges, to provide a total reconnaissance cover of its
objects. To regard cubism as exclusively encryptive, and reconnaissance
as exclusively decryptive, then, would be to install both within the
very positivist, cryptological syntax whose rejection they embodied.

<p>
Early accounts of cubism described the movement as reckoning in new ways
with an old problem: the impossibility of inducing natural stereopsis
from within a two-dimensional pictorial space.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  The parlor stereoscope had provided one solution to this problem; but
  even it could not induce the viewer's eyes to converge and accommodate
  differently at separate depth planes within the fused image, with the
  unlifelike result that foreground, middleground, and background depth
  planes in a stereogram are all simultaneously in focus. In taking
  up this problem, cubism might be described as a second-generation
  stereoscopy, trading optical illusionism in for other techniques of
  suggesting, narrating, or inflicting depth. In 1912, two prominent
  cubist painters, Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, undertook in their
  essay <i>Cubism</i> to defend and publicize the movement, and above
  all to begin a process of reeducation, one that would address "the
  difficulty which even a sensible and cultivated public experiences in
  reading modern works." Heretofore, they argued, the public had only
  been looking at cubist paintings through the retina. But cubism had
  from the start been cognizant of the flatness of the picture plane,
  utterly dispensing with the notion that a painting acted as a window
  looking out onto Cartesian space. Such a recognition confronted the
  limitations of retinal perception for painting, not the least of
  which being that in the single depth plane of pictorial space, the
  reflex of focal accommodation to different depth planes was mooted,
  and thus "the convergence which perspective teaches us to represent
  cannot evoke the idea of depth." Since even a painstaking reproduction
  of perspectival dimensions and proportions failed to convey depth,
  painters had to resort to more distortive means of conveying "the
  fictitious depths in which the co-ordinative light resides":
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Let us imagine a landscape. The width of the river, the thickness of the
foliage, and the height of the banks, the dimensions of each object and
the relations of these dimensions&#8212;these are secure guarantees. Well,
if we find these intact upon the canvas, we shall have learned nothing as
to the talent or the genius of the painter. River, foliage, and banks,
despite a conscientious representation to scale, no longer "tell" by
virtue of their width, thickness, and height, or the relations between
these dimensions. Torn from natural space, they have entered a different
kind of space, which does not assimilate the proportion observed. This
remains an external matter. It has just so much importance as a catalogue
number, or a title at the bottom of a picture frame. . . . The painter has
the power of rendering as enormous things that we regard as infinitesimal,
and as infinitesimal things that we know to be considerable; he changes
quantity into quality. [<i>C,</i> 25-6]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



With the stereoptic reflexes annulled by pictorial space, the painter
could compensate by distorting the dimensions of natural space in such a
way that they would once again "tell" as depth&#8212;i.e., by a variation
on hyperstereopsis. Painters also had recourse to "tactile and motor
sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality
which, contracting or dilating, transforms the plane of the picture. As
in reacting this plane reflects the personality upon the understanding
of the spectator, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage
between two subjective spaces" (<i>C,</i> 29-30).
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  It is no longer the iris alone, but the whole personality that
  contracts or dilates. Reimagined here as a synesthetic perceptual
  organ, the new spectator would open his or her whole sensorium to
  the painting even as the painter had done; painter and spectator
  would collaborate in the creation of a pictorial space through the
  fusion, not of two sightlines, but of two subjectivities. Despite its
  antiocularcentrism and its insistence that painters are not geometers,
  <i>Cubism</i> retains stereopsis, or rather hyperstereopsis, as its
  master trope, widening its parallactic baseline from an interocular to
  an intersubjective distance. Gleizes and Metzinger even conferred a
  variant of stereoptic fusion on cubist painting. Confident that even
  "the least intelligent" painters and spectators would eventually
  recalibrate their perceptual habits in accordance with cubist
  hyperstereoperception, they forecast a day when "the fact of moving
  around an object to seize several successive appearances, which,
  fused in a single image, reconstitute it in time, will no longer make
  thoughtful people indignant." Meanwhile, they declared, cubist forms
  must remain "sufficiently remote from the imagination of the vulgar to
  prevent the truth which they convey from assuming a general character,"
  and cubism must continue to "employ its own language, in order to
  move, dominate, and direct the crowd, not in order to be understood"
  (<i>C,</i> 54-5, 24, 62).

<p>
The notion that the serial glances constituting a cubist painting could
"fuse in a single image," as if with a sudden stereoscopic clarity,
seems questionable given the sense of irretrievable dispersal conveyed by
much cubist work. Besides, Gleizes and Metzinger seem here to describe
the painter's, rather than the spectator's, fusion of a series of
"appearances" onto a single image plane. But in other accounts of cubism,
an experience very like stereoscopic fusion is clearly attributed to the
spectator. In his <i>Rise of Cubism</i> , Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler,
one of the movement's key exhibitors and dealers, likened cubism to
"stereometric drawing on the plane," adding that it can present "an
analytical study of [an] object which the spectator then fuses into one
again in his mind." Though Kahnweiler conceded that the fusion may lack
the "closed manner of the stereometric drawing," he nonetheless bestowed
on that more "open" fusion the same ontological status as the stereoscopic
image: "there exists, as well, but only in the mind of the spectator,
the finished product of the assimilation, the human head, for instance."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  This "assimilation," he added, could be assisted through a painting's
  titular reference to familiar objects, mention of which would summon
  catalytic memory images in the spectator:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Naturally, with this, as with any new mode of expression in painting,
the assimilation which leads to seeing the represented things objectively
does not immediately take place

<b></b>

when the spectator is unfamiliar with the new language. But for lyric
painting to fulfill its purpose completely, it must be more than just a
pleasure to the eye of the spectator. To be sure, assimilation always
takes place finally, but in order to facilitate it, and impress its
urgency upon the spectator, Cubist pictures should always be provided
with descriptive titles, such as <i>Bottle and Glass</i>, <i>Playing
Cards and Dice</i> and so on. In this way, the condition will arise which
H. G. Lewes [<i>sic</i>] referred to as "preperception" and memory images
connected with the title will then focus much more easily on the stimuli
in the painting. [<i>RC,</i> 12-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The painting could further facilitate the spectator's "assimilation"
by including recognizable details&#8212;clues, such as domestic
objects or personal effects, that could help establish the scale,
location, and orientation of its subject. Picasso's 1910 portrait
<i>Daniel-HenryKahnweiler</i> (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#1" name="1"> 11</a>), a celebrated example of
analytical cubism, offsets its defamiliarizing gestures with details
such as the subject's watch-chain, a bottle and glass, a table, and a
piece of New Caledonian sculpture. Like the materiality and familiarity
of its work titles, the cubist detail suggests the movement's residual
engagement with more conventionally realist forms of representation, and
its odd proximity to the detail-obsessed, decryptive, and denominative
operations of reconnaissance. And as with reconnaissance, Kahnweiler
insisted that despite cubism's concessions to the familiar, its spectators
must, in the name of "urgency," relearn perception, becoming familiar
with the movement's "new language" and enlisting their memories of
more conventional perceptual acts in order to "assimilate" the cubist
image. Viewers who misconstrued cubism as "Geometric Art" did so, he
said, because geometry was the only memory image they could connect with
the paintings. That misperception would end "as soon as the spectator
familiarizes himself with the new method of expression and gains in
perception" (<i>RC,</i> 13).

<p>
As they did in reconnaissance discourse, such prescriptions for
a reeducated spectator served social as well as perceptual ends in
the reception of cubism. Like Kahnweiler, Picasso likened cubism to a
language that only some people understood: "The fact that for a long
time Cubism has not been understood and that even today there are people
who cannot see anything in it, means nothing. I do not read English, an
English book is a blank book to me. This does not mean that the English
language does not exist, and why should I blame anybody else but myself
if I cannot understand what I know nothing about?"
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  By equating the viewing of a painting with various forms of
  translation&#8212;from one language to another, from optical
  dispersal to assimilation, from lies to "the truth that is given us
  to understand"&#8212;such directives made a two-way toggle switch
  of the spectator's understanding. As a result, they conferred an
  elite identity on those spectators who could answer one question in
  the affirmative: "Do you <i>get it</i>?" Thus, however much Great
  War <i>camoufleurs</i> like de Sc&eacute;vola may seem to have
  misappropriated cubism as a straightforwardly encryptive resource,
  one finds that the dichotomous logic of camouflage was immanent within
  cubist self-representation from the start, and furthermore that cubism
  partly contracted that logic from the stereoscope, only a subset of
  whose users could gain access to the "fictitious depths" latent in its
  flat images. Along with the gatekeeping question as to its spectators'

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 375]</b>

understanding, cubism also issued them a series of implicit dares, all
of which point up both its adversarial tendencies and its homologies
with Great War reconnaissance: can you either recover the subject named
by the image from its defamiliarized form, or find the irrecuperable
estrangement of that subject pleasurable, legitimate, interesting, or
important? Will you assimilate work titles like <i>Still Life</i> and
<i>Woman with Pears</i>, commonly found in more conventional contexts,
in their reapplication to a seemingly violent dismemberment of the old
optical order the titles ask you to remember? Will you be able to achieve
a fusion of such paintings and their titles, perceptually unifying those
two disparate informational fields? How far will you go in retraining
yourself either to see anew, or to assent to not-seeing as a nobler,
worthier, harder, or more contemporary act of perception?

<p>
From two spectacularly different vantages, the conscripted gazes
of the reconnaissance observer and the cubist spectator converged
in a single scopic regime. Both were asked to gaze on conspicuously
flat image spaces and endeavor, through retraining their perceptual
coordinates and reflexes, to produce a "fusion" or "assimilation"
in the mind that would reveal objects in "fictitious depths" that were
both deeper and more overtly fictitious than the conventions of Cartesian
perspectivalism. This fictitious depth was constituted not only of spatial
parallax, but of temporal as well: the cubist painting projected a series
of glimpses onto a single canvas, while aerial hyperstereoscopy allowed
a simultaneous fusion of stereopairs shot in sequence; both constructed a
mobile rather than a fixed observer in relation to the observed. Like the
parlor stereoscope of which they were rival offspring, cubism and aerial
stereoscopy depicted an object in such a way as to make it seem the more
present for being the result of a differential effect that took place,
if it took place at all, nowhere but in the mind of the observer. They
required their observers to earn that impression of presence, along with
its conceit of providing a three-dimensional cover (seeing under bridges
from above, say, or behind forward-facing <i>demoiselles</i>), through
an arduous perceptual reeducation, one that forced them to confront the
contingency of scalar stability, depth perception, normal dimension,
and ultimately the coexistence and interpenetration of different spatial
orders. But as a reward for that reeducation, they promised to admit the
observer into an elite made up of those who "understood." Obviously cubism
and Great War reconnaissance bore very different relations to physical
violence, the latter being explicitly involved in planning, facilitating,
and confirming destruction. But the chief site of that destruction
proved the most hospitable climate for cubist painting during the war
years: although its reputation suffered amid the formal conservatism of
patriotic Paris, cubism thrived at the front. There, soldier-painters
such as Fernand L&eacute;ger, Andr&eacute; Fraye, Albert Gleizes, and
Andr&eacute; Mar&eacute; used cubist analytical syntax to represent the
real destruction they were now helping to fend off and to wreak.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Although this essay has juxtaposed the observer constructed by Great
War reconnaissance with the corresponding re in cubist painting,
other pairings suggest themselves. To begin with, stereopsis has long been
understood as integral to the rative and philosophical vocabularies of
much modernist literature. The differential optics of parallax undergird
meditations on both epistemology and ethics in Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>,
a text that also asks to be read stereoptically, challenging
its readers to fuse Homeric and contemporary narratives without
conflating them, remaining mindful of how each narrative consecrates
or desecrates, distorts, rectifies, or relativizes the other. Woolf's
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is structured around a stereopsis of class and
gender, pairing the upper-class Clarissa with the petit-bourgeois Great
War veteran Septimus&#8212;characters who, like stereopairs, are kept
adjacent but separate, throwing one another into relief. Roger Shattuck
has described the chronotope of Proust's <i>&Agrave; la recherche du
temps perdu</i> as binocular in its abandonment of motion for the relief
effects achieved by juxtaposing arrested, temporally disjunct moments.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  In all three cases, however, one notes that the conspicuously broad
  separations between various conceptual stereopairs&#8212;separations
  in class, gender, genre, time, and space&#8212;suggest not the subtle
  interocular distance and simultaneity of parlor stereograms, but the
  more considerable spatial and temporal intervals, the self-conscious
  distortion, and the equivocal interpretive mandates of reconnaissance
  hyperstereoscopy. The stereoptic preoccupations of such texts might be
  revisited in the context of a second-generation stereoptic regime,
  one distinct from nineteenth-century stereoscopy in its use of
  scalar manipulation and industrialized image production, in its
  role as the perceptual component of an integrated weapons system,
  and in its conflicted claims about its own simultaneously realist
  and illusionist powers.

<p>
In other registers, too, reconnaissance optics and rhetoric were
homologous with a whole series of gestures that have come to seem
characteristic of many interwar modernisms. As Great War reconnaissance
did with aerial photography and the stereoscope, modernist texts tended
to recombine nineteenth-century representational technologies, but
within hyperbolized contexts that insisted on the interdependence of
representation and destruction. They foregrounded the extent to which
conventions of documenting the real are constructed by strategic and
compensatory exaggerations that become naturalized, even normativized,
over time. While indulging frequently in fantasies of comprehensive
and totalizing representation, they also illustrated the dependence
of such fantasies upon site-specific, partial, relativistic acts of
perception. They further shifted the function of reading and viewing
away from the veridical category of "vision" to "<i>a</i> vision," the
expression of a lone artist whose worldview was so radically eccentric
as to invalidate former ways of reading and seeing. Having nullified
the usefulness of precedent, they asked their viewers or readers to
engage in extravagant acts of rediscipline and reeducation, to devote a
lifetime not just to studying, but to "studying under" a singular text
or artifact (e.g., <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, <i>Ulysses</i> and
<i>Finnegans Wake</i>, the <i>Cantos</i>, Duchamp's <i>Large Glass</i>
with its unique physics).
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  They thereby created, and in several cases plainly set out to create,
  elite corps of interpreters devoted to exceeding the standards of
  mere accuracy in extracting meaning

<b></b>

from every detail in a semiotic field. In doing so, they activated the
oppositional dynamics of encryption/decryption, presenting themselves
as puzzles for their interpreters to solve through perseverance,
resourcefulness, collaboration, and the development of new interpretive
protocols and technologies. This oppositional relationship recast the
artist in a manner largely peculiar to the twentieth century: as an
adversary whose occulted intentions the observer set out to fathom
by decoding, identifying, and interrelating objects in a textual or
perceptual domain, using exaggerative theoretical optics and interpretive
trigonometry to take the measure of those objects by the light of social
forces external to the artist's control. And by calling for interpretive
schools whose work was inseparably devotional <i>and</i> adversarial,
they helped catalyze the relation of ambivalence that is characteristic
of much twentieth-century critical discourse toward its objects, a
stance in which affection and aggression seem inextricably knotted,
even mutually constitutive.

<p>
This last series of claims will seem to make a totalizing gesture of
its own, one in which the technical, rhetorical, and social dynamics of
Great War reconnaissance are put forward as the key to all modernist
mythologies. This is certainly not the aim of this essay, which seeks
rather to juxtapose two disjunct images of a culture wrestling with
the predication of totality on locality, partiality, contingency. If
these two images appear to fuse into an integrated concept, that
concept is none other than the recognition of any totalizing system
as illusionist, as possessed of decryptive or explanatory powers
only in proportion as it exaggeratively dubs "real," "natural,"
"infallible," or "total" observations that it knows to be vulnerably
site-specific. To bring a remote object out of flatness, the critic,
like the observer, overcompensates: seeing it in any legible depth is
the result of distortion&#8212;a falsified conflation or a distended
separation of moments, spaces, gazes, discourses, epistemes. Yet this
counterdistortion neither restores nor presupposes the dimensions
of the real with any certainty, because the process of mapping the
pathways of critical stereopsis reveals what formerly were "normal"
dimensions to be "a normal," a highly contingent baseline rather
than a fixed cardinal point. If the veridical notion of "vision" has,
in the process, been forsaken for the more eccentric criterion of "a
vision," the critic-observer hopes to recuperate in tactical advantage
what has been lost in the waning&#8212;or sacrifice&#8212;of ocular
proof, stable notions of the natural, and the fantastic certainty of
a God's-eye view. A critical overview of modernist reconnaissance,
if it is sufficiently attentive to its subject, will have schooled its
observer to be circumspect about its own final, panoramic observation:
that aerial hyperstereoscopy was paradigmatic of the dominant status of
the observer in the early twentieth century.

<p>
Writing during the late 1930s of cubism and the airplane view of
America, Gertrude Stein was performing her own act of modernist cultural
reconnaissance. Two radically separate high-altitude stereopairs lay
beneath her lenses: on one side, a long-expired avant-garde movement;
on the other, a technologically sponsored view of the earth that cubism's
key exponents had never, to her knowledge, seen firsthand. The respective
images&#8212;after all, rather flattened versions of cubism and early
aerial perspective&#8212;were both spatially and temporally disjunct,
occupying different discursive spaces

<b></b>

and historical moments. Stein's prose juggles the stereopairs about,
uncertain whether they line up in a relation of causality, and if
so, which way that causality flows. If the two images can be said to
fuse, they do so in the elusive but suggestive notion that creators
are supercontemporary: that they are people who simply and instantly
intuit the epoch-making changes their contemporaries must register in the
fullness of time. The rhetorical majesty with which the idea is expressed
belies the spatial and temporal contingency of which it is the special
effect. Yet the illusory nature of Stein's synthesis is nothing against
its persuasive force among students of modernism, whom it has repeatedly
"come right up and hit" as a crucial formulation. That quality of being at
once theatrically distortive and revealingly (or revoltingly) accurate is
characteristic of many modernisms, and many interpretive theories about
modernism. So are the stakes concealed by this hallucinatory realism:
namely, an observer of "splendors" whose aesthetic power is indissolubly
bound not only to the potential destruction of the object but also to the
violent perceptual and ethical redisciplining of the observer. Such an
observer could experience both the annihilation of the represented object
and the trials and spectacle of her own retraining&#8212;as Stein does in
her conclusion to <i>Picasso</i>, and as Powys-Lybbe did in her wartime
reunion with the stereoscope&#8212;as unalloyed aspects of "splendor."

The Englishman Charles Wheatstone, one of the inventors of the
stereoscope, had been among the first to posit a physiological reason for
this impossibility: "When the painting and the object are seen with both
eyes, in the case of the painting two similar objects are projected on the
retinas, in the case of the solid object the pictures are dissimilar;
there is therefore an essential difference between the impressions
on the organs of sensation in the two cases, and consequently between
the perceptions formed in the mind; the painting therefore cannot be

At a job interview in the 1980s, the then head of the English Department
at Birmingham University opened the questions with the following remark:
"I might well be accused of being anti-Semitic, but don't you think that
writing about Jews is rather narrow?" Since the 1980s there has been,
thankfully, a sea change in our understanding of the canon of American
and European literature. For the most part, this has been an important
corrective to the largely uncritical view that existed before this
period which merely celebrated the canon as a bastion of universalizing
(presumably "non-narrow") human values. We now have a more historically
grounded and nuanced understanding of the ways in which supposedly great
literary and cultural achievements can be complicit with the worst of
human behavior.
<p>
There is nothing particularly new about this pessimistic view of western
culture. It was first articulated in the 1930s and 40s by proponents of
the Frankfurt School, especially Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and
Max Horkheimer, and was popularized for an Anglo-American readership by
George Steiner in the 1960s. As Steiner states in his <i>Language and
Silence</i> : "The ultimate of political barbarism grew from the
core of Europe. . . . This is of obvious and appalling relevance to the
study or teaching of literature. It compels us to ask whether knowledge of
the best that has been thought and said does, as Matthew Arnold asserted,
broaden and refine the resources of the human spirit."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Instead of the ideals of an Arnold or an Eliot, Benjamin's oft-quoted
dictum&#8212; "there is no document of civilization which is not at
the same time a document of barbarism"&#8212;

<b></b>

has been taken to speak for our age. One can move quite easily from
Arnold to Eliot in these terms (however much Eliot disdained Arnold)
in their respective roles as cultural arbiters who use the language of
race to underline their authority.
<p>
I have always thought that it is a mistake to overdetermine or moralize
individual writers as particularly unforgivable anti-Semites or racists
as this lets the rest of the culture off the hook. Over the years, this
approach has tended to marginalize the question of racial discourse in
literature as it is deemed to be beyond our routine concerns, a specialism
concerned only with loathsome individuals. To this extent I follow Lionel
Trilling whose critical study of Matthew Arnold was the first and is still
the best account of Arnold's use of race as a category in <i>Culture and
Anarchy.</i> In his book, Trilling writes that in Arnold's day "racial
theory . . . was almost undisputed" and he then goes on to list some
of the many examples of those who, in his words, were "to foster and
elaborate the notion of a racial constant" in the nineteenth century:
"Stendhal, Meredith, . . . Carlyle, J.A. Froude, Kingsley, Taine, Renan."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Trilling concludes that his "list could be made to include nearly every
writer of the time who generalized about human affairs" and this is
also the main conclusion of my own work (<i>MA,</i> 234-5).
<p>
It is particularly instructive to go back to Trilling as his measured
and controlled voice contrasts markedly with the sound of bombast
and moral self-righteousness which informs so much of the recent
debate as instigated by Anthony Julius and Tom Paulin on Eliot and
anti-Semitism. To be sure, in his book on Arnold, first published in
1939, Trilling goes to the heart of one of the key questions addressed
in  concerning Eliot and the treatment of Jews
in Nazi Germany:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If some used [a "racial hypothesis"] for liberalising purposes, as Arnold
himself did, still, by their very assent to an unfounded assumption,
they cannot wholly be dissociated from the . . . whole of official German
thought in the present day (<i>MA,</i> 235).
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Trilling argues that however liberalized Arnold's use of a racial
discourse, there remains an association between Arnold's racial
distinctions (between Semite and Aryan) and the institutionalization
of this racial rhetoric in Nazi Germany. It goes without saying that
no one in 1939 knew that such liberalized race-thinking would lead
to the death camps. But it is essential, I believe, to move away
from a teleological view of European anti-Semitism (culminating in
the Holocaust) which immediately transforms it into an aberrant or
pathological phenomenon. As Hannah Arendt has argued, once we think
of Jewish literary representations as fixed "stereotypes," "myths," or
"images," that have remained essentially the same across the centuries,
they become merely "natural consequences of an eternal problem."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
By decontextualizing modern anti-Semitism, the only context that is
allowed&#8212;that implicitly addresses anti-Semitism as an "eternal
problem"&#8212;is that of Nazi Germany. And yet, Trilling's sense that he
had been working on a re whom he could not wholly dissociate from
"official German thought" (<i>MA,</i> 235) clearly haunted him. In
an exchange of letters in 1943-4, Trilling challenged Eliot's notion
that Kipling was "not particularly anti-Semitic" with the following
devastating retort:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As anti-Semitism goes these days, I suppose Kipling is not&#8212;to use
Mr. Eliot's phrase&#8212;particularly anti-Semitic. I certainly should
not think of isolating for discussion what anti-Semitism he has, but
only of mentioning, as one aspect of a complex xenophobia, his queasy,
resentful feelings about Jews.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This exchange is instructive when read next to the most recent studies of
Jews in English literature published in the past decade. One approach,
which is closest to my own work, views the re of "the Jew" through
the lens of certain dominant discourses&#8212;whether they be empire,
nation, religion or race&#8212;and therefore perceives the representation
of Jews, in Trilling's terms, as a microcosm of broader concerns.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Other critics working in this field tend to focus on a conventional
historiography of anti-Semitism and stress mainly hostile negative
images and violent acts against Jews.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
These studies reinforce Arendt's "eternal" images of Jews and focus
primarily on a free-floating discourse (outside of time and space) which
is, by definition, decontextualized. Anti-Semitism, in these terms,
can only be understood as something that is essentially illiberal and
un-British (or un-American) which automatically locates it outside of
a liberal cultural context (be it late-nineteenth-century Boston or
early-twentieth-century London).
<p>
The debate between Ronald Schuchard and Anthony Julius is limited,
therefore, by its use of this conventional historiography of
anti-Semitism. In fact, Schuchard's insistence on Eliot as an ill-defined
"philo-Semite," and Julius's insistence on Eliot as an ill-defined
"anti-Semite," are mirror images of each other. Both think of Eliot
as either exceptionally benign or appallingly hostile (reinforcing his
foundational status in the Anglo-American canon). Both also think of him
as peculiarly unambivalent: with a straightforward and undifferentiated
affinity or hostility towards Jews. In these terms, both are also
dismissive of previous accounts of "Eliot and anti-Semitism" whether
it be by "Jewish critics" (an acceptable racial category, it seems)
that disagree with Julius or, in the case of Schuchard, any critic that
dare suggest that Eliot uses the language of "race" (as if this language
cannot also be used for "philo-Semitic" purposes).
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Once locked into the "discourse" (pace Julius) of either "anti-Semitism"
or "philo-Semitism" there is a predictability in both of their approaches
as the only "adversarial" reading that is allowed is a reading that
reinforces Eliot's supposedly self-evident predispositions.
<p>
For this reason, I prefer "semitic discourse"&#8212;as opposed to
"anti-Semitism" or "philo-Semitism"&#8212;because this phrase has the
advantage of eschewing the inherent moralizing in deciding who is, or is
not, "anti-" or "philo-." Instead of employing a predetermined "anti-"
or "philo-" perspective that explains any given reading, ironically
the one consistent feature of literary representations of "the Jew"
as a cultural signifier is its protean instability or ambivalence. The
work of Zygmunt Bauman is especially important in this regard as he
has rightly replaced "anti-Semitism" and/or "philo-Semitism" with what
he calls "allosemitism" which utilizes the Greek word for otherness,
<i>allus,</i> when referring to the practice of representing "the Jews"
as a radically different "Other."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
What the use of "allosemitism" or "semitic discourse" recognizes is
that the terms "anti-Semitism" and "philo-Semitism" are two relatively
distinct

<b></b>

aspects of a much broader history of differentiating Jews from other human
beings. The danger is that the conventional historiography continues to
essentialize Jews as uniquely timeless, unchanging victims and therefore
positions the history of anti-Semitism outside of the social, political,
and cultural processes which gave rise to this history in the first place.
<p>
The great advantage of liberating oneself from a conventional
vocabulary&#8212;which tends to be focused around moralized biographical
readings&#8212;is that it enables the literary critic to conduct a
genuinely open dialogue about the complex nature of racial discourse
within literary texts which neither excuses nor accuses the writers under
discussion. In the case of Eliot, it opens up a way of thinking about his
use of racial discourse which accepts that, like Joyce, he constructed
the Jew as a re of confusion; a perfect objective correlative for a
modernist skepticism. But, unlike Joyce, who embraced this confusion in
the re of the "greekjewish" Leopold Bloom, Eliot wished to impose
distinct boundaries between Hebrew and Hellene, Aryan and Semite, which
is most apparent in his social thought and less apparent in his poetry.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
To be sure, Eliot moved further away from Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> in his
increasingly doctrinaire essays. Two years after his influential review
of <i>Ulysses</i> in the <i>Dial,</i> Eliot was to return to Joyce's
ordering "mythic method" in a 1923 <i>Criterion</i> commentary on
"The Importance of Greek":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he study of Greek is the exact study of an exact language, a language
of refinement and precision . . . the study of Greek is part of the
study of our own mind: Our categories of thought are largely the outcome
of Greek thought; our categories of emotion are largely the outcome of
Greek literature. One of the advantages of the study of a more alien
language, such as one of the more highly developed oriental languages,
is to throw this fact into bold relief: a mind saturated with the
traditions of Indian philosophy is and must always remain very different
from one saturated with the traditions of European philosophy&#8212;as
is <i>every</i> European mind, even when untrained and unread. What
analytic psychology attempts to do for the individual mind, the study
of history&#8212;including language and literature&#8212;does for the
collective mind. Neglect of Greek means for Europe <i>a relapse into
unconsciousness.</i>
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The rigid associations, in this editorial, between Greek literature and
thought as the "language of [emotional] refinement and precision," on the
one hand, and the inexact non-European "alien languages," on the other,
are characteristic of Eliot's social thought in the <i>Criterion.</i>
Such generalizations, however, also hark back to the rather loose
references to the "mind of Europe" in "Tradition and the Individual
Talent" . In this restatement of his earlier essay, Eliot fears
that the collective "European mind" might potentially be superseded by
"alien" traditions. By neglecting Greek&#8212;which defines "our own
mind"&#8212;the exactness of "our categories of thought . . . and emotion"
are fatally undermined and threatened with "a relapse into [oriental]
unconsciousness." Such oppositions, which endanger the fragility of the
"mind of Europe," result in what Maud Ellmann has called a "contagion
of antitheses" in the work of Eliot.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Unlike Joyce's artful deconstruction of a racial discourse in
<i>Ulysses,</i> Eliot's excluded oriental "alien languages" constantly
return, in unexpected ways, to haunt his poetry.

<b></b>

In striving for "classical" exactitude and canonical authority,
Eliot relied upon a Semitic double&#8212;which could not, quite, be
repressed&#8212;to represent the opposite of his "Greek" ideals.
<p>
What is missing from the current debate is (to use Trilling's words) the
"queasy, resentful" identification which Eliot had with regard to Jews
in both his poetry and social thought. Julius's dismissal of Eliot's
Unitarian background&#8212;which Eliot clearly thought of as a form of
Arnoldian Hebraism&#8212;is telling in this regard.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
As late as his "American Literature and Language" , Eliot described
the household of his childhood as if he had, himself, been one of the
biblical Children of Israel:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The standard of conduct was that which my grandfather had set; our moral
judgments, our decisions between duty and self-indulgence, were taken as
if, like Moses, he had brought down the tables of the Law, any deviation
from which would be sinful. Not the least of these laws, which included
injunctions still more than prohibitions, was the law of Public Service:
it is no doubt owing to the impress of this law upon my infant mind that. . . I have felt . . . an uncomfortable and very inconvenient obligation
to serve upon committees.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's bathos can be compared with Arnold's famously grandiose
self-fashioning at the end of "The Function of Criticism at the Present
Time"  where he thinks of the modern critic as a Moses-re who
has a Pisgah-sight of the "promised land" of culture; an image which
Joyce in <i>Ulysses</i> was to cheerfully debunk. That Eliot encountered
a very real hostility in attempting to promote the modernist avant-garde
could only reinforce these forms of Jewish self-identification. Here we
have, for instance, an extraordinary letter by C. S. Lewis to Eliot's
friend, Paul Elmore More, written in 1935, which rewrites Eliot as part
of a group of cosmopolitan aliens who threaten to cause the downfall of
Western Europe:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Assuredly [Eliot] is one of the enemy: and all the more dangerous
because he is sometimes disguised as a friend. And this offence is
exaggerated by attendant circumstances, such as his arrogance. And (you
will further forgive me) it is further aggravated for an Englishman by
the recollection that Eliot stole upon us, a foreigner and a neutral,
while we were at war&#8212;obtained, I have my wonders how, a job in the
Bank of England [<i>sic</i>]&#8212;and became (am I wrong) the advance
guard of the invasion since carried out by his natural friends and allies,
the Steins and Pounds and <i>hoc genus omne,</i> the Parisian riff-raff
of denationalised Irishmen and Americans who have perhaps given Western
Europe her death wound.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Eliot, like "the Jew," is a "disguised" enemy who wheedles his way
into key financial institutions and, with a few alien co-conspirators,
helps to bring about the collapse of European civilization. But this
is a story of endless projection and displacement. Lewis, himself a
"denationalised Irishman" (as Ricks points out), projects his own sense of
foreignness onto the son of a Hebraised Unitarian liberal (T. S. Eliot)
who in turn projects his own sense of alien cosmopolitanism onto what
he calls "free-thinking Jews" and even the Judaised Matthew Arnold whom
he could never forgive (in essay after

<b></b>

essay) for replacing Christianity with culture. In "Mr. Eliot's Sunday
Morning Service," an under-represented "quatrain" poem in these terms,
the Hebraised "master of the subtle school" proliferates meaningless
words (or laws) and, thus, helps to perpetuate an all-encompassing
spiritual malaise. As Schuchard notes, Eliot's fear of contributing to
the social degeneration which so appalled him helped shape his definition
of Classicism, in a 1916 lecture, as "essentially a belief in Original
Sin&#8212;the necessity for austere discipline."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Eliot's disciplined search for a fixed sense of tradition and a
transcendent "order" took many forms&#8212;a fastidious Englishness; a
devout Anglo-Catholicism; and a keen political authoritarianism&#8212;all
of which were constructed to oppose his own dark Semitic double.
<p>
Once we stop shaping our responses to literature in terms of either
"anti-Semitism" or "philo-Semitism," it is possible to recognize those
moments in literary texts when "anti-Semitism" and "philo-Semitism"
become indistinguishable and there is instead an interplay between these
supposed irreconcilable states. In "The Approach to James Joyce," one
of many radio broadcasts that Eliot was to give during World War II,
he argued that the structure of <i>Ulysses</i> is realized by Joyce
"introducing himself&#8212;the same Stephen Daedalus who is the hero
of the <i>Portrait</i>&#8212;and he creates Bloom as a counterpart,
an opposite to himself."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Bloom is conceived rather conservatively by Eliot as Joyce's "opposite"
or "counterpart" who throws the self into relief. Eliot spent most of
his life trying to maintain the distinction between "self" and "other,"
Gentile or Jew, which Joyce was to joyously subvert.
<p>
Rather than seeing Horace Kallen as Eliot's liberal Jewish opposite,
as Schuchard argues, the Kallen-Eliot correspondence might be most
significant in relation to their points of agreement especially
with regard to the question of race and culture. After all, Kallen
published a series of articles in the <i>Nation</i> in 1915 where he
opposed the vision of an ethnic "melting pot" (soon to be popularized
by Israel Zangwill) as this would negate the "group-consciousness" of
American-Jews and other ethnic groups in the United States. Zangwill's
ideal of the "melting pot" can be thought of as a radical continuation of
the Arnoldian ideal of culture as it is designed to supersede differences
of all kinds. But Kallen vigorously opposed Zangwill and instead argued
that after attempting to assimilate, immigrants to the United States
would inevitably discover their "permanent group distinctions" and would
be finally "thrown back upon . . . [their] ancestry." As he was to state
notoriously (and later repudiate): "Men may change their clothes, their
politics, their wives, their religions, their philosophies, to a greater
or less extent; they cannot change their grandfathers."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
As with Eliot, and a great many other Christian and Jewish thinkers before
World War II, Kallen believed that race, not culture, determines ethnic
identity. While such logic was eventually anathema to Kallen, as it is to
ourselves, it is clear why Eliot would have been attracted to his Jewish
counterpart who managed to be both progressive (as a cultural pluralist)
and reactionary (as a racial determinist) at one and the same time. Rather
than praising or condemning supposedly benign or abhorrent individuals,
what is needed is a much greater understanding of the cultural context in
which particular writers and thinkers produced their texts and utilized
racial discourse. It is symptomatic

<b></b>

in this regard that Julius's account eschews any archival research
and also failed to acknowledge many of the studies of "Eliot and
anti-Semitism" that preceded him. In this regard, Maud Ellmann is
absolutely right to argue that: "Without . . . attention to textual
and biographical detail, the critic, in exposing anti-Semitism, always
runs the risk of witch-hunting, of re-enacting the paranoia of the
anti-Semite towards the Jew."

<blockquote>
<!--_epigraph-->
In the last hundred years the world has changed far more quickly and
completely than in many preceding centuries . . . People in a hurry
travel by aeroplane; you can fly to Paris for tea and be back in London
in time for dinner. First the telegraph, then the telephone, and finally
the discovery of wireless, have brought the remotest parts of the earth
closer and closer together. . . . The United States are, in effect,
nearer to London than Scotland was one hundred years ago.
<p>
The developments of science . . . are welding the world into a whole,
whether its people wish it or not.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/epigraph-->
</blockquote>

<p>
So wrote Maxwell Garnett, Secretary of the League of Nations Union,
in 1924.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Today, the clock may be running faster, but the discourse of
globalization is surprisingly the same. Contemporary theories, it
is true, focus on the compression of the world through internet
connectivity, the rise of multinational corporations, and the
homogenizing work of globally marketed music and film; today economics
rather than science is "welding the world into a whole." But it is
doubtful whether we are much further in grasping the implications of
Garnett's title, "The World Becoming One."
<p>
Globalization, although frequently hailed as a recent phenomenon, has
been a long historical process. Political scientist David Held traces
the development of globalization from the Roman and Mongol empires;
sociologist Roland Robertson begins his schematization in the fifteenth
century. Both identify a shift, in the eighteenth century, away from
incipient global forms to the primacy of the nation-state; yet both
mark the beginnings of a new global consciousness in the second half of
the nineteenth

<b></b>

century.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Held designates globalization's "modern" period as 1850-1945, noting
the rise of transnational secular ideologies and discourses, such as
liberalism, Marxism, and modern science; Robertson calls the 1870s to the
mid-1920s globalization's "Take-off Phase," citing the sharp increase
in global communications, the entry of non-European societies into
"international" society, the increasing diffusion and implementation of
ideas at the international level (the ecumenical movement, the Olympics,
the Nobel Prizes, the Gregorian calendar, and the League of Nations),
and the first <i>world</i> war.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
The modernist period merits attention for its significant role in
the emerging global consciousness; moreover, investigating this role
in its literature enables two important critical moves. First, it
deflects the appropriation of "globalization" for a process driven and
determined solely by economics, claiming cultural globalization as an
equally important, if indeed not earlier, development. Second, it poses
modernist literature's engagement of perspectivism and pluralism as a
generative site for an alternative discourse of globalization&#8212;one
that at the very least complicates the specters of exploitation and
homogeneity that are often assumed to be the inevitable consequences
of a globalized world. Early work on modernism tended to connect its
fascination with subjective perceptions to philosophical relativism or
psychological impressionism, but other equally strong factors include
the increase in world travel (particularly to and from Asia), the
rise of translation, and the growing sense of crisis regarding global
conflict. Did modernist perspectivism, applied in these situations,
yield insights in global understanding? Or, to pose the reverse question,
did increasing encounters with cultural others help to <i>produce</i> the
multipersonal novel? Did an expanding awareness of <i>inter</i>-cultural
connectivity inform the new <i>intra</i>-cultural discourse that was
beginning, at that time, to emerge?
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
To pursue a <i>cultural</i> discourse of globalization,
however, we need first to distinguish between "globalization" and
"geopolitics." Today geopolitics can be used broadly to refer to any
locational approach to political issues, but historically the term was
introduced with the specific connotation of location as territorially
framed. <i>Geopolitik</i> was coined in 1899 by the Swedish political
scientist Rudolf Kjell&eacute;n, for whom it signified a Darwinian model
of state power dependent on territorial growth: stronger organisms survive
by displacing the weaker. Kjell&eacute;n's theories were a major influence
in the developing ideology of Nazi Germany, but the geopolitical model
is generally taken to be the dominant paradigm in the West until the
end of the Cold War. As geographer Brian Blouet points out, geopolitics
is a land-based ideology; it locates power in territorial magnitude and
focuses on the carving up of earth's space. In contrast, Blouet identifies
globalization as originally a maritime-based ideology deriving in large
part from the Dutch; it offers an open rather than closed space paradigm,
locating power in movement rather than bounded territory.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
It is important to note that the contrast is not one of <i>bad</i>
geopolitics versus <i>good</i> globalization; both paradigms can be
subject to imperialist co-option. Territorial imperialism involves the
annexing of space and/or of minds; globalized imperialism relies on
movement&#8212;the ability of power to cross borders, to reconre
itself, to maintain its exploitative role by shifting to the most
vulnerable site for its goals. But in a further complexity, we should
also not assume that

<b></b>

globalization works only in imperialist ways. Economic globalization may
be predatory or productive; cultural globalization may be colonizing
or cooperative. Both dystopian and utopian potentialities are within,
and negotiate within, both economic and cultural forms.
<p>
Geopolitics shifts to globalization as crucial technologies become
increasingly based on the <i>circulation</i> of capital, information,
goods, and services, and as the operative model shifts from bounded space
to multidirectional flows. On the economic side, globalization can be
succinctly defined as "the progressive integration of national economies
into a global market economy, as measured by the increasing flows of
trade, investment, and skilled personnel across national boundaries."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Cultural globalization is a much less certain process; who can measure
the flow of an idea, much less track its origin or gauge its effect? The
very messiness and uncertainty surrounding the issue has led many either
to reject globalization as an overused and now meaningless clich&eacute;
or to identify it exclusively with economic imperialism, leaving, as the
only alternative, the oppositional stance of <i>anti-</i>globalization. A
third possibility is a broad and continuing historical investigation
of global currents of thought, tracing the complexities and thus the
choices that animate the multidirectional experience of living in an
interdependent, interactive world.
<p>
The first half of the twentieth century offers an excellent point of
entry, since the period both marked the demise of the British Empire
and simultaneously saw the emergence of the field of international
relations. When, at the outset of World War I, Leonard Woolf wrote his
pioneering proposal for international government as a first step in
the prevention of global destruction, he relied almost exclusively on
primary sources. As he recalled, "You could not become an authority on
international government in 1915 by reading books, because the books
did not exist."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Yet Woolf discovered that the world was not lacking in examples of
international cooperation. In the postal service, for example, he
noted the remarkable handling, in 1906, of an international imbalance
in which the Persian government was carrying internal delivery costs
for foreign bibles being shipped to them from Great Britain and the
U.S., with no corresponding recovery of postage costs for equivalent
external shippings of the Koran. While Western Christians displayed
"a passion for sending bibles to the Persian Muhammadans," there was
a notable absence of missionary zeal on the other side. Responding to
the inequity, the Postal Congress authorized the Persians to impose an
internal levy on all incoming foreign post. Another more amusing instance
that Woolf cites involves an attempt, in Warsaw in 1913, to forge an
international agreement among eighty-nine white slave traffickers;
the meeting terminated with all participants being apprehended by
the police. If international relations had not yet been theorized,
there was nevertheless varied evidence of its emergence in practice
(<i>AA,</i> 2: 135-6).
<p>
In larger terms, the increase in world travel, the broader dissemination
of information through newspapers and broadcasting, and the openness at
the time of both Russia and China all stimulated a growing awareness,
on the part of the ordinary citizen, of living in global space. And,
again in England, this ordinary citizen was being strenuously urged to
develop a broader cooperative consciousness in relation to the world.

<b></b>

In their popularizing, educative role, supporters of the League of Nations
disseminated the message that the League was dependent for success on
the support of the general public. Whatever the political reality,
the materials produced for schools and general audiences emphasized
the democratic, grassroots nature of the League's operation: if the
League was shaped by its members, its members were in turn shaped by
public opinion. In characteristically inclusive fashion, E. E. Reynolds
explained, "That is where we come in; for we help, each of us, to form
public opinion."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
And the values stressed as the foundation of public support were, in
the words of the essay by Garnett cited above, "mutual dependence,"
"international co-operation," and the rights of "minority populations."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
Garnett's essay appeared in the journal of the Workers' Education
Association, and the responsiveness of at least some of the British public
to these appeals is reflected in a student's essay that appeared a few
years later in the same periodical. Written by W. H. Drumm, a member
of the Bradford Psychology Tutorial Class, "The Best Practical Way to
Internationalism" proposed to make such theorized mutual dependence a
reality: the "international ideal" could be achieved "by allocating to
certain countries the job of supplying the world with those commodities
for the manufacture of which each country is most suitable."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
England would supply cloth; Germany, toys; Denmark, dairy products;
and Greece, dried fruits. Competition would thus be eliminated in
international markets and all countries would be bound together
in interdependence and "friendly trust." Drumm's practical reality
may not have been too practical, but he understood the ideological
task. Advocating, in addition, foreign travel and the learning of foreign
languages, Drumm concluded by urging the common goal of cultivating
the cooperative spirit in individual minds.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
That this cooperative ideal was constructed <i>in opposition</i> to
the reigning imperial paradigm is clear in Leonard Woolf's scathing
critique, <i>Imperialism and Civilization,</i> published the following
year. Placing the root problem firmly on an economic footing, Woolf
asserted that the current global tensions were not attributable to
differences in nationality, race, or religion but to the descent of a
"new, commercialized industrialized civilization" upon civilizations
organized primarily along traditional and agricultural lines.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
While acknowledging that the nineteenth century was not the beginning of
imperial relations, he argued that it did produce an entirely new form:
a "predatory"
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
technological economy that demanded a constant diet of ever-expanding
markets and raw materials (<i>IC,</i> 9), joined to a new nationalistic
patriotism that sought not only to annex territory&#8212;as older
imperialisms had done&#8212;but to force the subordinated civilization
to adjust or conform to the civilization of the dominant. Forcing other
peoples to change in ways that previous forms of imperialism had not
attempted to do, nineteenth-century imperialism exerted the double
power of "economic penetration accompanied by political control"
(<i>IC,</i> 61). The resulting disparity in power relations, Woolf
argued, <i>produced</i> racial and religious tensions where they had not
existed before; in addition, the inevitable revolt against inequality
caused new, and to some extent artificial, geopolitical coalitions to
be fabricated out of previous diversity. Likening the rising fear of a
"Pan-Islamic movement" to the earlier "Yellow Peril" that

<b></b>

haunted Kaiser Wilhelm II, Woolf claimed a certain poetic justice in
the terror inflicted on the imperialists by "these international bogeys"
of their own creation (<i>IC,</i> 26). For these seemingly united forces
were both bogus and yet an identifiable sign:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There has been a notable revolt of Islam against the Christian States of
the West, and a remarkable drawing together of Islamic peoples. But it
is the revolt against imperialism, against the tyranny of the Western
civilization and the hegemony of European States, which has effected
this. [<i>IC,</i> 26]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, in Asia and Africa, Woolf continued, imperialism <i>forced</i>
nationalisms to appear, uniting the oppressed peoples and "[teaching]
them to use their new cohesion against their conquerors and rulers"
(<i>IC,</i> 28).
<p>
There is much in this irascible and yet astonishingly prescient book that
would be worth pausing over today, but what interests me here, in light of
the issues I raised earlier, is the interaction in Woolf's text between
the global and the geopolitical. We can mark the incipient presence of a
globalized economic imperialism in the process that Woolf is recording,
but then trace the way it becomes subsumed under geopolitical aims,
and produces geopolitical thinking in response. For not only does Woolf
delineate the emergence of geopolitical identities as a reaction against
exploitation; he himself turns ultimately to the geopolitical as the only
immediately viable path. Convinced of the insurmountable impasse created
when radical imbalances of power define relations between an alien enclave
of one people situated within a larger population (whether that enclave is
the African American in the United States or the white minority in South
Africa), and seeing only in South America an ameliorative intermixing
and intermarrying between the "invading Europeans" and the "native
inhabitants," Woolf resorts to the preservation of national purity as the
only alternative to violence until an equality of peoples can be achieved.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The thrust of his separatist argument, it is true, is to dissuade his own
government from further white settlement in Kenya, and he gestures toward
a future guided by the League's alternative discourse: a "synthesis of
civilizations" as interrelated parts of a vast international society,
in which "[t]he forcible subjection of one people . . . by others
. . . becomes an absurdity and an anachronism" (<i>IC,</i> 120). But he
nevertheless concludes that, as long as "the whites are determined to
preserve their political and economic supremacy," as long as "Europe is
to be for the Europeans, and America for the Americans, and Australia
for the Australians," then "Asia must be for the Asiatics, and Africa
for the Africans" (<i>IC,</i> 103, 134-5).
<p>
Woolf's indictment of the human being as economic animal is strong,
but it is precisely at this point, at the point of retrenchment into
separatist isolationism, that his model needs the complication of other
dimensions. Economic circumstances produce cultural attitudes; however,
the flow of influence can also run in the reciprocal direction. There can
be more motivating factors, even in financial matters, than materialism
and testosterone. And while it would be na&iuml;ve to think that all
cultural attitudes work for the good, the realm of human thoughts and
emotions is nevertheless the place where <i>better</i> motivations must
be sought. Cultural globalization offers not an exclusionary sphere but
a different starting point. By turning from economic to cultural

<b></b>

forces, and from the geopolitical to the globalized imagination, we
can facilitate other answers by questioning in different ways.
<p>
What, then, is cultural globalization? The authors of <i>Global
Transformations</i> take, as their definition of culture, "the
social construction, articulation and reception of meaning," which,
in the processes of globalization, become subject to "the movement
of objects, signs and people across regions and intercontinental
space." Yet such movement is meaningless for an understanding of
cultural globalization without an account of its effect&#8212;without an
examination of "the stretching and deepening of cultural relationships and
practices." Cultural globalization is found in "patterns of reciprocal
interaction," which include, but also expand far beyond, "the global
spread of corporate symbols and pop culture." The "modes of interaction"
are diverse, flexible, varied&#8212;ranging through "homogenization,
contestation, hybridization and indifference" (<i>GT,</i> 328-31).
<p>
The definitive quality of cultural globalization thus lies in
interactivity and interdependency. The flows of influence are
multidirectional; nothing is static or fixed. Arjun Appadurai defines
the new form of "global cultural processes" as "an organized field of
social practices, a form of work . . . and a form of negotiation between
sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Delineating the various areas in which such negotiation takes place
(categorized as ideoscapes, technoscapes, financescapes, ethnoscapes, and
mediascapes), Appadurai shows, at the same time, how these "scapes" exist
in interaction with each other. Approaching the world as "one large,
interactive system, composed of many complex subsystems," Appadurai's
recourse is to chaos theory and "complex, overlapping fractal shapes"
to image the whole (<i>ML,</i> 41, 46). Fractals, as stochastic and
unpredictable and yet with detectable repetitive patterns, serve well
to represent the nature of "disjunctive global flows" (<i>ML,</i> 47).
<p>
Chaos, it should be noted, while unpredictable is not indescribable and,
from what I have observed, globalization, in both economic and cultural
forms, is marked by at least four characteristics. Disjunctive global
flows are:

<ol>
<!--_orderedList-->
<li><i>kinetic</i> (Global processes are marked by movement, fluidity,
and a continuous process of formation, deformation, and reformation.)</li>

<li><i>interdependent</i> (No action occurs in isolation; whatever one
country or person does affects other countries or people, and the meaning
of a practice in one location is in part dependent on what others are
doing elsewhere.)</li>

<li><i>contextual</i> (The same action has different meaning in different
places.)</li>

<li><i>impure</i> (A globalized understanding involves a recognition of
diversity with the self, within cultures, and within the globe. And,
perhaps paradoxically, this acknowledgement of differences must
ultimately incorporate the "pure," according to the principle that,
if conceptualizations of the globe are to be inclusive, they must also
accommodate those who define their identities as homogeneous.)</li>
<!--_/orderedList-->
</ol>

<p>
Globalization thus does not exclude identity as conceived in terms
of geopolitical boundaries; but it situates those constructs within a
multidirectional, global space. The geopolitical and the global will
always coexist; furthermore, within the global, there will always be
both imperializing and liberating tendencies at play. In E. M.

Forster's <i>Passage to India,</i> when pushed to respond to the question
why he is in India filling a post that an Indian would otherwise have,
Fielding answers, "I take up some other fellow's air, don't I, whenever
I breathe?"&#8212;a remark that is both insensitively facetious and
ruthlessly to the point.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
John Updike's early poem "Trees Eat Sunshine" is another succinct
reminder that our mutual inhabiting of the globe is always a
consuming of someone else's resources&#8212;a brutal reality that,
once recognized, argues for the ethical realism of balancing our needs
as inevitable consumers against our <i>need</i>&#8212;again a basic
need for survival&#8212;to maintain, both cognitively and physically,
an ecologically balanced world.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
And to do that, we must be self-reflexively aware of our cultural
locations and understand these cultural locations not as autonomous
countries but as regions of the world. For some cultures, that may
involve thinking themselves out of positions of dominance and into
mutually dependent forms. Critiquing the patriarchal and militaristic
professor of literature, Sir Walter Raleigh, Virginia Woolf wrote,
"He never pressed on over the ruins of his own culture to the discovery
of something better."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
It is that impetus or "pressing on" in modernist literature that I seek
to trace.
<p>
In the next section of this paper, I turn to an analysis of various
"modes of interaction" that constitute modernist global flows (<i>GT,</i>
330). My approach is to categorize different tropic structures, or
"res of thought," in order to explain some of the ways in which
global connectivity entered into literary, and hence public, discourse
during the early twentieth century.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Without suggesting a comprehensive schematic, I distinguish four strands
of globalized thinking in modernist texts, which, for ease of discussion,
I call critical, syncretic, cohabiting, and runaway modes. There is,
of course, an extreme irony in logically separating identifiable
units out of a fluid, chaotic, and kinetic process. These modes are
not as distinct as rational division makes them appear. Nevertheless,
by dipping into literary texts and scooping up particular narrative
events, we can isolate some distinctive characteristics of cultural
encounters before returning them to the flow.
<p>
My approach, it should be noted, in many ways echoes Susan Stanford
Friedman's delineation of five "tropic patterns"&#8212;which she names
nation, borders, migration, "glocation," and conjuncture.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
But I find it revelatory of the nature of globalization that the
logical relation between our different categorizations is difficult if
not impossible to fix: they overlap but are not collapsible; neither
can be construed as subsets of the other. To some extent, Friedman's
tropic patterns are at a broader theoretical level; they refer perhaps
to the materials of transcultural thinking whereas mine refer more to
resulting effects. But our schematizations relate to each other&#8212;to
borrow Friedman's term&#8212;paratactically; I hope they will be read
side by side.
<p>
What our projects have perhaps most in common is an attempt not to
systematize but to use systematic understanding to open up the multiple
possibilities in transcultural encounters. If Orientalism is the dominant
formation of the geopolitical imagination, we need a corresponding
understanding of the global imagination, even though it may be less
amenable to a singular approach. In the following examples, I attempt
to delineate the transformative possibilities arising when the self is
resituated out in the world

<b></b>

of global flows. Such reformation of the self constitutes merely one
aspect of globalization, but an aspect, I submit, whose consideration
could not be more pertinent to the global problems confronting us today.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
1. Critical Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Critical globalization uses knowledge of other regions or countries to
disrupt habitual perceptions and practices, and to prompt a self-reflexive
repositioning of the self in the global sphere.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
It resembles the typical learning experience of the traveler but the
transformative experience arises, not through an encounter with the
foreign, but through the imagined adoption of the other's point of view.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
The trope for this perspectival shift is chiasmus, sometimes enacted in a
literal shift to another's eyes. In the following passage from <i>Heart
of Darkness,</i> for example, Marlow's reversing perspective, as he
walks toward an approaching African, inverts the racial clich&eacute;:
"He had a uniform jacket with one button off and seeing a white man on
the path hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This was
simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he
could not tell who I might be."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The shift merely gestures to the African's point of view, but it effects
a change in the white intruder from seeing to being seen, from privileged
individual to the unknown mass. The mirror of self-ethnography thus
critically disrupts the complacency of self-location, as in this 1929
critique of the teaching of history in the British schools: "Many of
us grow up knowing nothing of China but pigtails, and that the women's
feet were cruelly bound there (the teachers who told us were at the
waist tightly corseted themselves)."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
This reversing gaze is the foundational trope in <i>Letters from John
Chinaman,</i> in which Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson adopts a Chinese
persona to construct the English as the foreigners in the text.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
The genre is the Oriental Tale, in the tradition of Oliver Goldsmith's
<i>The Citizen of the World,</i> where the voice of an Asian observer
is employed to distance and satirize English customs; but Dickinson
goes further to inhabit the body of the other, locating himself
within a different system of belief. According to Forster's biography,
Dickinson once told a group of students that "in a previous existence,
[he] actually was a Chinaman!"
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
The claim might appear to be fanciful teasing, except for its congruency
with a line from one of Dickinson's private letters: "It's a curious
thing to have a woman's soul shut up in a man's body, but that seems
to be my case."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Dickinson's ability to slide between gendered and cultural locations
becomes a way of achieving critical globalization in his own imaginative
space. Posing anonymously as John Chinaman, he enacts&#8212;on the
analogy of cross-dressing&#8212;a cross-culturing that exhibits the
multidirectionality characteristic of global flows.
<p>
The letters are forerunners to Leonard Woolf's attacks on predatory
imperialism and indeed to Dickinson's formulation of the initial scheme
for a League of Nations, in August 1914.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
In this earlier work, international tensions are evoked in the lightly
sketched political background of the crisis that the British called
the Boxer Rebellion, but which John Chinaman describes as "the recent
attack of the Western Powers on China" (<i>LJC,</i> 52). But the focus
shifts from immediate events to underlying causes,

<b></b>

mounting a disparaging critique of the primacy given in the West to the
"cash-nexus" (<i>LJC,</i> 7), the na&iuml;ve belief in international trade
as a stimulant to global relations (<i>LJC,</i> 15), the violence and
lawlessness of imperialist behavior in occupied lands (<i>LJC,</i> 17,
52-3), and the correspondingly ironic "mission" to "civilize the world"
(<i>LJC,</i> 10).
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
In contrast, Chinese society is shown to display the alternative values
of a rational, humane, moral, and <i>democratic</i> approach. But
cultural contrast on its own does not make the global imagination;
the sense of multidirectional flows derives from the dialogic relation
between writer and reader. The anonymous Chinese official encodes the
voice of the other&#8212;meaning the <i>English</i> reader&#8212;in
his text, considering and answering his reader's objections, admitting
imperfections in China, acknowledging the value of Western inventions,
allowing for the possibility that long absence has caused him to
idealize home. The writer presents a balanced, self-reflexive view,
and he does so through an ongoing response to an encoded "you"
in his text. As he admits, "I am too well aware of the complexity
of all human affairs to deny that there may be something in your
point of view" (<i>LJC,</i> 59). While the situating of narrator
and narratee inscribes the geopolitical idea of opposing cultures,
the dialogic treatment breaks down oppositional relations. Even the
title of the work is difficult to fix: as the phrase of an English
writer, it inscribes Anglo-centrism; as a phrase from a Chinese pen,
it parodies and critiques the colonizing English mind. Ultimately the
one significant difference is between monocentric and global views:
the writer attributes Christianity's failure to produce an adequate
social model to its origins in the "untravelled imagination" of a "mild
Oriental enthusiast," whose knowledge of other cultures and languages
was not very great (<i>LJC,</i> 26, 48). John Chinaman, by contrast, has
a broader understanding, not simply because he is Chinese, but because
he has also lived in England for some time. For it is the traveled
imagination that grasps the chiasmic twist: "Learn to understand us,
and in doing so learn better to understand yourselves" (<i>LJC,</i> 63).


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
2. Syncretic Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The traveled imagination perfectly describes Yoshio Markino, a Japanese
artist who lived in London for well over forty years. Markino was
well versed in ancient Chinese philosophy, history, and poetry, and in
the literature and history of Japan; he read extensively in English,
publishing an essay, for example, on "Chaucer and Chinese Odes."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
He lived in Japan, America, and England, and he painted in England,
Paris, and Rome. But in Markino's work, the globalized imagination works
syncretically rather than critically. Syncretic globalization refers
to processes of accrual, expansion, or extension&#8212;but not merger:
<i>The American Heritage Dictionary</i> defines <i>syncretic</i> as
"a reconciliation or fusion . . . <i>especially when success is partial
or the result is heterogeneous.</i>"
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
In <i>A Japanese Artist in London,</i> Markino's title is deliberate. His
writing identity is not hyphenated Japanese-English, but "Japanese in
England and in English," indicating the self situated in global flows.
<p>
Yoshio Markino was born into a Samurai family at the time of the Meiji
restoration and the advent of modernization in Japan. Like Dickinson,
Markino fit uneasily into

<b></b>

his society's gender roles, being&#8212;though apparently
heterosexual&#8212;as much like a girl as a boy. A sensitive child and
close to his parents, he suffered the loss of his father's Samurai
position, the death of his mother, and a somewhat unhappy adoption
into a family of cousins. Avoiding an arranged marriage, he "ran away"
to the West in the hope of becoming an English poet. Convinced by
friends to shift to the study of painting, Markino spent an unpalatable
four years in San Francisco, after which he moved to London (in 1897),
where he lived on his painting and writing until his return to Japan in
1942. Whereas Dickinson lived as a Cambridge don under the adopted sign
of a Chinese cap,
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Markino inhabited an adopted name. "Yoshio" was the name given to
him after his mother's death, to avoid confusing him with a cousin;
the spelling "Markino" altered the usual transliteration "Makino,"
by adding an "r" to ensure an English pronunciation closer to the
original. Forced in part to respond to a naming by others, Markino
nevertheless used the floating sign to construct a Japanese self in
global terms. Once signing an art gallery guest book, "Whole world is
my home," Markino turned dislocation from a sorrow into a freedom.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
At the same time, selective syncretism provided points of cultural
contact through which he became a self-appointed cultural ambassador,
negotiating friendship between East and West.
<p>
In his written English, Markino believed he was inventing a "new
style"&#8212;an attempt "to express [his] emotion in the way of ancient
Chinese rhetoric," while simultaneously striking a corresponding
"sympathetic emotion" in the English reader.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The emotional connection depends, as he says, on both "sympathy" and
"wisdom," thus requiring from his readers an active response (<i>RR,</i>
123). For the writing is both delightfully simple and perceptually
demanding.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Markino presents himself with a humility, a childlike trust, a
na&iuml;vete that, in its apparent lack of concern for self-preservation,
is easy to misidentify&#8212;as English critics often did&#8212;as
artlessness, as "charm," as picturesquely quaint. Yet his writing is
charged with a complexity that is at once disrupting and affiliating in
effect. The title of one of his books, for example, <i>My Idealed John
Bullesses,</i> plays with the English stereotype with even further twists
than Dickinson's "John Chinaman." At the same time, Markino recuperates
the stereotype through his kindness and affection, presenting the
Englishwomen as neither ideal nor idealized, but <i>idealed.</i>
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
His courtesy denotes a highly sophisticated ethics requiring a shift in
English positionality to understand its implications; it also functions
as a mirror asking his audience to respond in kind. His words are formed
for "friend making," and designed to "win the hearts" (<i>RR,</i>
127, 125). His dream is to create global harmony and a better world,
by advancing what I might term "the ethics of a circulating spiritual
economy."
<p>
An ordinary incident readily illustrates his approach. Although habitually
poor, whenever he could afford to eat in a restaurant, he did so in
order to study the people. On one occasion, leaving what he believed
to be three pennies on the table, he mistakenly left a ten-shilling
piece as well. When the waitress ran after him to correct his error,
Markino&#8212;despite his poverty&#8212;immediately divided the amount
into five shillings each. And he explains, "I was much appreciative with
her faithfulness."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
The unidiomatic words are semantically exacting: honesty appreciates
in repeated giving,

<b></b>

for the waitress was <i>literally</i> faithful to the "sacred conscience"
common to us all (<i>JAL,</i> 72). Money and generosity must be freely
given into sacred circulation, but the functioning of the system depends
on constant return. On another occasion, Markino credits a shopkeeper
with displaying no racial discrimination in his welcoming greeting,
"we 'ave our colonies all <i>hover</i> the world, sir, white men,
yellow men, brown men and black men are forming parts of the British
nation" (<i>JAL,</i> 9). "What a broad mind he had!" writes Markino,
both capturing the shopkeeper's own variety of English and generously
refraining from any comment on the imperialist phrasing or the ignorance
of Britain's relations with Japan. The challenge to the reader, however,
is not to underestimate Markino's implications. He "charms" by being
grateful and appreciative, but he seeks to elicit a corresponding
appreciation of <i>his own</i> generosity to the English, and to stimulate
an ever-expanding generosity in return. And his syncretic writing,
which Douglas Sladen describes as "a medium using the capabilities of
both languages," expertly articulates his combinatory cultural approach.

3. Cohabiting Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Dickinson's rational critique and Markino's empathetic appeal work
in different ways to pull the reader into the global dynamics of the
text&#8212;one a Western text in disguise as an Eastern text, one an
Eastern text in Western disguise. What they establish is reciprocal rather
than oppositional relations (between East and West, between writer and
reader), and a desire to move into the stream of cultural flows. But
if critical and syncretic globalizations attempt in different ways to
put cultures into relation with each other, the third mode involves a
perception that understands them as separate and distinct. However,
unlike Orientalism, this mode of globalized perception understands
difference as operating from a different center; the other culture remains
unpredictable, uncircumscribable, because it originates elsewhere. Cast
as "cohabiting globalization," this mode acknowledges the autonomous,
independent being of the other. It treats the "unknown" in the foreign
culture not as an inherently mysterious and exotic element but as
a condition of the necessarily limited understanding of the viewer;
and it resists the assimilation of difference into one "normative"
language. As an apprehension of alterity that refrains from positing
essence, it imagines a world of separate, complex individuals who inhabit
and share mutual space.
<p>
My informing example here is a short story by Joyce Cary, first published
in 1950, but most likely written in 1938-39, and originating still
earlier, in Cary's experience as a lieutenant in the Nigerian Regiment
in World War I.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Set in a temporary camp in the Cameroons, the story recounts a late-night
conversation between an Irish-British subaltern, named Corner,
and Umaru, a Hausa sergeant. The exchange is neither a sentimental
sharing&#8212;which would appropriate Umaru into Corner's world&#8212;nor
an epiphany of mystic otherness&#8212;which would construct Umaru as
an exoticized foreigner. Instead, Corner apprehends Umaru as another
human being in the world.
<p>
Set within the cultural crisis of war, the subsidiary setting of an army
camp internalizes a further "contact zone"&#8212;what Mary Louise Pratt
defines as a "social space where

<b></b>

disparate cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
But whereas Pratt notes that such zones often display "radically
asymmetrical relations of power," the power dynamics in Cary's story
reveal multiple orderings at work.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Army hierarchy subordinates the sergeant to the commissioned officer,
but the ordinary soldiers, shy of both Corner and Umaru, isolate their
superiors together on one side of the giant canvas that shelters their
rest. But equitable relations among all the men are red in the
domestic imagery that converts the scene to "a vast family bed with
one white and nineteen black faces sticking out all round a large
patchwork quilt" ("U," 20). The domestic analogy furthermore implies
an alternative hierarchy&#8212;the precedence of age: "Sergeant Umaru,
thirty-year veteran, called often Father Umaru by the men" is credited
with clear seniority in experience ("U," 19).
<p>
On this particular night, Corner lies awake grappling with the cataclysmic
disruption of the war and troubled by existential angst. Unable to sleep,
he attempts to engage Umaru in conversation, but every assumption he makes
about Umaru's thinking turns out rather comically to be wrong. A pattern
emerges in which Corner advances a hypothesis which Umaru then disproves,
or Corner invokes consensus only to encounter Umaru's dissent. Corner
assumes that Umaru's second name&#8212;Bauchi&#8212;refers to his place
of origin; Umaru dryly remarks that the name is simply an identifying tag
in the Army. Corner, seeking sympathetic understanding, ventures that it
isn't good to be lonely; Umaru asserts his solitary independence. Corner,
a Protestant, blunders in taking Umaru's comment that it is good to
live like a Haji to mean that Umaru, a Muslim, regards God familiarly
as a friend; and finally Corner's digressions on the beauty of the
clouds are rejected in wondering contempt by the old sergeant who
reads in the clouds a coming storm. But rather than plunging Corner
further into troubled anxiety, the imperturbable stability of the older
man brings the younger ecstatic relief. The reversing view of his own
<i>in</i>experience releases Corner from the burden of his attempts to
understand&#8212;either Umaru or the world. Corner's inability to "know"
Umaru is cathartic, confirming that the universe is not coterminous with
his own limited self, and relieving the burden of alienation through a
non-appropriative or non-assimilated epiphany of an<i>other</i> man.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
The experience of cohabitation is then realized through the sense
of touch. The conversation ends when Umaru leads in a traditional
Hausa blessing for sleep and good health, and turns his back to go
to sleep. But one tiny part of their bodies remains in contact. Lying
still for another hour, Corner is aware of "the place where his elbow
touched Umaru's back" and that one tiny point generates a steady flow of
affection and pleasure ("U," 24). Corner experiences a moment of being
in touch&#8212;ratively and literally&#8212;but the experience is not
one he requires his conscious mind to possess. The native "Other" in this
narrative is still limited to a role in the British&#8212;or in this case,
Irish&#8212;man's experience, since Umaru's own narrative is only lightly
glimpsed from the outside. However, in this particular mode of global
imagining, that is the very point. The autonomy of the other person is
asserted by recognizing the real existence of other subjective worlds.

<b></b>

<p>
Cohabiting globalization fosters the construction of home identity
not as a center but as a region of the world; it correspondingly
promotes an understanding of the world as a pluralistic home of diverse
individuals. I have referred elsewhere to "universal individualism"
as a pivotal modernist concept, deriving the term from Leonard Woolf.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
As Woolf asserts, the democratic ideals of the French Revolution
"only translate into social and political terms the consciousness of
<i>universal individuality</i> and the right of everyone to be treated as
an individual, a free fellow-human being" (emphasis added; <i>AA,</i> 2:
386). In perceiving the "I" of "the Other," the traditional opposition
between individualism and collectivity is diffused. Encounters with
individual voices from elsewhere situate the self relationally and
equally with others in the world.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
5. Runaway Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
If cohabiting globalization signals the positive potential in modernist
pluralism, a pluralistic vision nevertheless runs the risk of losing
an effective interventionist stance. The posture of extreme tolerance
can become an accommodating mode of passivity; more problematically,
it begs the question of how far tolerance should be extended to
the intolerant. Unlimited pluralism leads to the problem of runaway
globalization, to use a term borrowed from Anthony Giddens's <i>Runaway
World.</i>
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
For Giddens, the loss of control is closely associated with the vast
destabilizing forces of electronic money; in cultural globalization,
the loss posed by an excessive submersion in disjunctive flows is one
of ethical and emotional commitment.
<p>
Runaway globalization is evocative of the Gatsby era and, perhaps even
more strongly, of the rootless cosmopolitan society of Berlin in the
years leading up to World War II. The fascination of this free-floating
era is captured in Christopher Isherwood'sBerlin novels: <i>Mr. Norris
Changes Trains</i> and <i>Goodbye to Berlin.</i>
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Set in the last days of the Weimer Republic, the novels present a world
in which identities and desires are unbound, crossing both literal
borders and socially constructed boundaries of gender, sexuality,
politics, and the law. And for the narrator William Bradshaw (a
fictional-autobiographical crosser, bearing Isherwood's two middle
names), one significant crossed border runs between England (where
homosexuality was still criminalized) and Berlin (city, in the 1920s,
of de-territorialized sexual expression). But this freedom, though
liberating and even hypnotizing in <i>Mr. Norris Changes Trains,</i>
is ultimately runaway. Sexual and political promiscuity become merely
another capitalist coin&#8212;or electronic sign&#8212;in circulating
exchange.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
The penultimate of the linked short stories that make up <i>Goodbye to
Berlin</i> concerns the relation of the narrator (now named Christopher
Isherwood)&#8212;an impoverished writer and language teacher with vaguely
communist sympathies&#8212;and the Landauers&#8212;a wealthy capitalist
Jewish family, and owners of a high-class department store. Both the
Isherwood character and Bernhard Landauer, the nephew who manages the
family business, inhabit a world of global flows: the narrator is an
Englishman more psychologically at home in the sexually liberated and
erotically charged underworld of Berlin, while Bernhard is a Jew who
is at once the son of an English mother and a German father, a capitalist

<b></b>

through family responsibility but a sculptor by desire, and a traveler
throughout the Jewish diaspora who nevertheless feels that China is
his psychological home. Although the territorialized oppositions of
English/German, Aryan/Jew, Occidentalist/Orientalist, Communist/Capitalist
threaten to divide the two men, a stronger and more compelling connection
is implied through their common lack of fixity in any one position. But
despite the positive implications of their fluid subjectivities,
the disturbing weakness of this open world is exposed in their last
conversation, in which Bernhard makes the sudden, and deliberately
fantastic, proposition that the two of them leave (elope?) immediately
that night for China. Despite their previous, intimate contacts of touch,
in moments when Bernhard rests his hand on the narrator's shoulder,
Bernhard's proposal is treated by <i>both</i> men with an ironic blend of
politeness and mockery that exposes a fundamental <i>self</i>-mockery at
its roots. The daring proposal is of course not taken up; detachment from
the territorial, it seems, rests on a personal aloofness from commitment,
a constant multiple performative that makes a serious pledge too dangerous
a risk. But the unacted narrative disrupts the focalization for which this
work is well known ("I am a camera") with the alternative possibilities of
what might have happened had the narrator come out from behind his lens.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
As it is, eighteen months later, the narrator learns of Bernhard's
mysterious disappearance and death; the Third Reich begins; and the
narrator retreats to his English "home." Despite the unspoken bond
between Christopher and Bernhard (for by 1933, both Jews and homosexuals
were victims of Nazi persecution), in the world of nomadic nonjudgmental
detachment, tolerance has no ethical force. Runaway globalization is
routed by the power of the returning geopolitical.

Future Directions
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
What I have outlined here is merely a beginning, but I hope it will
be enough to suggest further worthwhile directions to pursue. There is,
however, an obvious question that must be addressed. Will seeking a global
consciousness in the modernist period ground our study once again in the
perspectives of white, Western, and privileged groups? Consciousness
of the whole needs to aim for inclusiveness of voice. The examples I
discussed above are admittedly all by male writers, but the selection
was deliberately made to represent various ethnicities and regions:
Chinese, Japanese, Nigerian Muslim, and German Jew. In addition, these
writers indicate a range of forms that globalized voices might take:
cross-culturing and performative (Dickinson), autobiographical (Markino),
and fictional (Cary and Isherwood). My earlier reference to an essay by
a student in working-class education suggests a further way to extend
our scope, and there is a rich field to explore in the prolific work
of modernist translation, including the translation of little-known
works into English and the translation of English modernist works into
other languages.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
In addition, cultural globalization, as I have defined it, involves
not only the movement of people but also the movement of objects and
signs. Literal travelers enact one form of global contact but objects
and artifacts speak in a different way to the complex

<b></b>

imbrications of cultural ties. Willa Cather's novels, for example,
quite apart from their numerous immigrant journeys, abound in markers of
embedded travel&#8212;the "traveling-in-dwelling" which James Clifford
argues is always already encoded in any putatively fixed cultural site.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
Objects have traveling histories: witness the bell, in <i>Death Comes
for the Archbishop,</i> which has come to New Mexico from Mexico,
but whose medieval Spanish inscription hearkens back to the time when
it was reputedly cast from silver melted down from household objects,
pledged by the Spanish during their war with the Moors. Furthermore,
this seemingly monolinear lineage is complicated by the information
that the ringing of the Angelus descended from a Moslem custom and
that the Spaniards learned everything they knew about working silver
from the Moors&#8212;a knowledge then passed on to the Mexicans, who
in turn taught the Navajos their art.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The path running back to past origins leaps the rails, so to speak, to
become, in reverse, a trajectory of skills moving into the present. But
what is important for my argument here is the way an ordinary artifact
embodies the complexities and contradictions of cultural crossings, here
encoding the paradoxical entanglements of hostilities and indebtedness
that define our relations in the globe.
<p>
Additionally, global consciousness can be accessed not only through the
life of common objects but also through a tie to the land. Cultural
globalization is distinguished by a consciousness of dwelling in
the world, and a conception of that world as a fluid, interconnected,
conflicted, and dynamic whole. At its best, perhaps, it manifests itself
as an ecological imagination, and in this form can be found in Native
American writers like Zitkala-Sa (Gertrude Bonnin). In her essay,
"Why I am a Pagan," Zitkala-Sa defines her "Paganism" not as belief
in pagan gods, but as "a compassion for all echoes in human guise,"
a compassion emanating from a conception of the globe as animated by
the Great Spirit flowing through us all.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
Although critical of the white Christian culture that inserts its
antithetical values into her world, she images the larger construct of
human community as "a living mosaic of human beings" or as "the ivory
keys of one instrument where each resembles all the rest, yet varies
from them in pitch and quality of voice" ("WIP," 802-3). If we take the
global imagination as signifying the ability to conceive of one's own
identity as part of an interrelated and interdependent world space,
and that space as multiform and contradictory, then imaginings such
as Zitkala-Sa's form part of the complex intersections that constitute
modernist cultural globalization.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
The critical challenge for this project may therefore lie not in
the exclusivity of globalization but in the need to establish certain
definitional parameters: not every cultural encounter should be taken as
a form of cultural globalization. Fundamentally, what is at issue is not a
prescribed feature of a text but a distinctive form of consciousness. And
it is this peculiar consciousness that relates so strongly to the kinetic,
heterogeneous fluidity that is a frequent characteristic of modernist
texts. For, in all my examples above, the narrative focalization is
subjected to a wobble&#8212;one that frustrates a fixed and exclusive
identification between the self and a home location, and constructs a self
that depends <i>for its identity</i> on being situated in the world. The
result is epistemic instability, but the accompanying gesture is toward a
"stability-of-process"&#8212;

<b></b>

a continuously decomposing and recomposing equilibrium created through
negotiations with views from other eyes. The paradigmatic shift traced
in outline replaces the ideal of cognitive certainty with the broader
value of cognitive mobility.
<p>
In thus bridging the aesthetic and the social, my analysis relates the
modernist effects of destabilized focalization to a growing awareness
of cultural heteroglossia. Equally crucial, and indeed deriving from
modernism's self-reflexive awareness of positionality, is a modernist
engagement with the ethical implications of living in an interdependent,
interactive world. For the question we continue to face is whether
cognitive mobility will be passive, or predatory, or productive of a
liberating, cooperating world. Today, calls for ethical commitment are
<i>part</i> of globalized discourse; they inhere in the process that
Richard Falk discusses as "globalization-from-below" (<i>CG,</i> 192),
or that Richard Sandbrook more broadly names "civilizing" or "humanizing"
globalization (<i>CG,</i> 2). But in economic globalization, ethical
intervention is most often framed as reactive and oppositional; in the
larger schematic, as Sandbrook indeed recognizes, we need to effect a
change in the way the world thinks (<i>CG,</i> 10).
<p>
It is my argument here that humanists have a role in humanizing
globalization, and that achieving a "culturally sensitive global economy"
requires culturally sensitive thought (<i>CG,</i> 266). The extent to
which <i>ideas</i> have the power to move economic and social realities
is, of course, debatable, as is the question whether a way of thinking
could ever be globally shared. The sobering effect of working in a
historical area such as modernism is the constant realization of how
little has changed. I have long been convinced of the Red Queen's command
to Alice, "<i>here,</i> you see, it takes all the running <i>you</i>
can do to keep in the same place."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Yet the battlefields of Europe in the modernist period have been
replaced, as I write, by communal forums working to forge a Constitution
of the European Union;
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
and the Dutch, who in the seventeenth century denoted the globalizing
imperialism of a seaborne empire, went on to provide a model, in the
1990s, for the mutually supportive structure of a cooperative welfare
state.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
As for the power of ideas, I balance their frustrating ineffectuality
with another view I encountered long ago&#8212;that the Industrial
Revolution was "technically possible" long before it happened, and it
required the presence of an enabling philosophical system to actualize
its birth.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
By recognizing at least the potential for the cultural imagination to
guide and direct economic forces, we open up a space beyond materialist
determinants for the vitally enabling role of human thought.
<p>
I began this essay by quoting Maxwell Garnett's words, in 1924, on
the world becoming one. In 1932, at approximately the same time as the
ending of Isherwood's <i>Goodbye to Berlin,</i> Nowell Charles Smith,
writing on the League in collaboration with Garnett, identified <i>two</i>
aspects of the changing world: in addition to <i>contraction</i> or the
shrinking of the globe, he named <i>sensitization</i>&#8212;the process
of being affected by what is happening elsewhere in the world.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Smith coined the latter term from the verb to <i>sensitize</i> in
photography&#8212;the action of "render[ing] (a plate, film or paper)
sensitive to the influence of light"
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
&#8212;a meaning that he wanted to "transfer by metaphor to the human
race."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
We need to seek, in modernist literature, a history of that
sensitization, charting its rapids, eddies, and flows. It is unlikely
to be the utopian project hailed in

<b></b>

Smith's title, "The Dawn of a World Order"
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
but, if it can help us to understand the complexities, the variations,
and even the failures of cultural globalization, it will contribute
its share to the foundation of a sustainable world.

(<i>IC,</i> 47, 133-4) Woolf's listing and then rejecting, on the grounds

a Swiftian outburst (<i>IC,</i> 100). As his autobiography makes clear,
not only did Woolf identify slavery with the Jewish progroms; he felt a
profound sympathy with all victims of "senseless savagery," and responded
with emotions of "acute pain," "disappointment," "horror," "discomfort,"
and "disgust" (<i>AA,</i> 2: 200-1, 487-8). Sudden outbursts of satire

for the "fate of the Western world." See [G. Lowes Dickinson], <i>Letters

<p>
Cultural studies has paid scant heed to questions of modernity, modernism,
and modernization. The leading journals in the field, such as <i>Cultural
Studies,The International Journal of Cultural Studies,</i> and <i>Social
Text,</i> very seldom publish essays that engage substantially with
such ideas. Of the forty contributors to the massive <i>Cultural
Studies</i> volume edited by Lawrence Grossberg, Cary Nelson, and Paula
Treichler, none expresses even a cursory curiosity about modernity or
modernism. Apart from one essay by Edward Soja, a similar indifference
pervades another widely used collection edited by Simon During. Sifting
through the ever-expanding pile of samplers, summaries, introductions,
and overviews of cultural studies, one is easily persuaded that it is
a field devoted entirely to the immediate present.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
What might seem like an unfortunate sign of historical hubris or academic
oversight is in some eyes the singular virtue of the cultural studies
project. "Cultural studies," writes Simon During, "is the study of
<i>contemporary</i> culture."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
It is a field that is adamantly yoked to the new and the now, a method
matched to its own moment, an approach tied to the epochal uniqueness
of our own image-saturated, consumption-crazed, globally connected yet
politically fragmented age. Since the mid-1980s, the lure of the word
"postmodern" has proved almost irresistible; when "modernity" appears
at all in cultural studies, it is often there to be refuted, derided,
or denounced, a handy catch phrase for conservative politics, old hat
metaphysics, and snobbish aesthetics.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
While cultural studies may seem oblivious to modernist studies, the
reverse is far from true. In literature departments anxious to remake
themselves, cultural studies has become a much

<b></b>

favored way of announcing that one is moving away from business as usual;
it is widely used shorthand for social relevance and political urgency,
for a clamorous movement to reconnect word and world. Although cultural
studies often gives short shrift to history, in literature departments,
paradoxically, it has come to signal a return to history. The "new
modernisms" are a much heralded part of this critical turn, speaking to a
sense of weariness with reverential rereadings of modernist masters and an
eagerness for broader, more expansive maps of the modern that can locate
texts squarely in the political fault lines and fissures of culture.
<p>
Yet the growing use of "cultural studies" as a catchall synonym for
"the study of culture" should give us pause. Not long ago, I heard a
well-known literary scholar remark in response to a question after his
talk: "of course, we're all doing cultural studies now." The proliferation
of such comments indicates that a specific rubric is being bloated and
distended beyond all recognition, in danger of becoming as ubiquitous
as it is useless. A phrase that once named a distinct project, an
intellectual tradition, a core cluster of ideas and arguments, is now
being stretched to subsume a grab bag of differing and often incompatible
textual methods. Cultural studies may seem like a useful umbrella term,
but if too many people try to cram under the umbrella, everyone will
end up getting very wet.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Cultural studies, it must be said, has not been overly anxious to rein in
the rampant, kudzu-like proliferation of its name. It is a much favored
gambit in the field to argue that any attempt to specify and hence limit
its agenda must be strenuously resisted. The downside of this claim
that cultural studies cannot be defined is that it becomes impossible
to show the wrongness of any particular definition. "Cultural studies,"
writes one critic, "is a whirling and quiescent and swaying mobile which
constantly repositions any participating subject . . . a project whose
realization . . . is forever deferred."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
For other scholars it is the model for "an interpretative politics with
no limits."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
This aversion to circumscribing the parameters of cultural studies often
goes along with a fervent denunciation of disciplinary straitjackets
and institutional orthodoxy. Insisting on the utterly nonroutine nature
of cultural studies is now a quasi-obligatory professional ritual.
<p>
To grasp what is at stake here, we need to reverse the optic, to realize
that modernist studies can throw light on cultural studies as well as
the other way around. Although cultural studies may pride itself on
being postmodern, many of its assumptions are in fact quintessentially
modern. Indeed, cultural studies is one of the latest avatars of the
spirit of the avant-garde. At first hearing, this claim may sound counter
intuitive; after all, doesn't cultural studies urge intellectuals to
renounce the arrogant assumption of superior wisdom and critical insight,
and to protest the all too common portrayal of ordinary people as mindless
masses and "cultural dopes"? Isn't its ethos, then, the very opposite of a
vanguard politics? In principle, yes; and yet this stalwart defense of the
popular can easily tip over into a new form of status-seeking distinction,
a covert bid for moral superiority and cutting edge radicalism in the
highly charged fray of academic politics. The vanguardism of cultural
studies takes a distinctive form; it lies not in vaunting the authority
of intellectuals vis-&agrave;-vis the people but in trumping its own
superiority as a field vis-&agrave;-vis the conventional disciplines.

<b></b>

<p>
The idea of the avant-garde, according to Matei Calinescu, yokes a
progressive and future-oriented vision of time to a cataclysmic splitting
of the world into opposed camps.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Assuming their own inevitable victory, avant-gardes define themselves
against the tyranny of the past, the forces of stagnation, the benighted
ignorance of old ways of thought. A parallel rhetoric runs through
cultural studies. Proclaiming itself the wave of the future, cultural
studies sees itself waging a form of guerilla warfare against the
tyrannical forces of the reactionary and hidebound disciplines. Cultural
studies is conjured in the future tense, as the certain culmination of
the righteous hopes of the present. Think, for example, of the title of
Anthony Easthope's book <i>Literary into Cultural Studies</i>; literature
departments may still be institutionally dominant, Easthope concedes,
but their days are numbered. Cultural studies is their manifest destiny
and salvation, the means by which a stodgy and conservative field of
study will be transformed into a suitably progressive one.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Moreover, cultural studies shares with the avant-garde a yearning for the
vital, the intensely immediate, the bracing fervor of commitment. Both
are enamored of the language of crisis, rupture, and transgression;
both yearn to smash the aura of the artwork, to topple the masterpiece
and tear down the walls between art and everyday life. F. T. Marinetti's
famous call to destroy "the museums, libraries, academies of every kind"
is echoed in cultural studies' contempt for the ivory tower and its
longing to reconnect the humanities to the wider world.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Marcel Duchamp hoped that the provocation of his ready-mades would
expose the fraudulence and hypocrisy of the art world. Similarly,
contemporary critics hail the study of Oprah and MTV as an assault on
the sacrosanct values of tweedy, out-of-touch mandarins.
<p>
It is a feature of avant-garde movements that they deny their own
precursors, claiming to be utterly new and without precedent. The much
noted presentism of cultural studies thus stems from the very modernity
that it claims to have surpassed, as it repeats the quintessentially
modern gesture of disavowing and disclaiming the past. Modernity holds
the blueprint for the insurrectionary impulses of cultural studies,
which are easily traced to the antinomian spirit of modern bohemianism
and the avant-garde. At the same time, modern history also contains
countless reminders of the gulf between revolutionary rhetoric and
social realities. According to Peter Burger's well-known thesis, the
enshrining of Duchamp's urinals and bottle racks in the museum exposes
the hollowness of the claim that changing the nature of the art work
will do away with the institution of art.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
It is equally misguided to think that studying soap operas instead of
Sophocles will efface the boundaries between scholarly knowledge and
everyday life. Cultural studies has done much to invigorate approaches
to popular culture, but it does so from a position squarely inside,
rather than outside, institutional frames.
<p>
Here I agree with Tony Bennett, one of the most astute theorists of
cultural studies as well as one of its most astringent critics. Cultural
studies, he argues, likes to cast its project in a heroic, even
redemptive, light, defining itself as a phantom social movement, a form
of politics by proxy. It appeals to two contradictory ideas; the myth
of marginality, exemplified in its critique of the institution, and the
myth of wholeness,

<b></b>

embodied in its claim to transcend rarified forms of academic
specialization. Bennett argues that neither of these myths has much
to do with the actual practice of cultural studies, even as they
perpetuate a misleadingly static, reified, and unhistorical view of
the disciplines. Instead of relying on a rhetoric of political charisma
and aesthetic transgression, he writes, we need "to fashion a clearer
sense of the specific and therefore limited frameworks of analysis and
inquiry that cultural studies might claim as its own in relation to,
and alongside, the concerns of more established humanities and social
science disciplines."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
In spite of the mutual misapprehensions outlined above, some scholars
of modernity are drawing on the methods of cultural studies while
steering clear of its oft-cited deficiencies: an excess of political
hubris and too cheaply bought radical righteousness, a dispiriting lack
of historical perspective, and an indifference to the archive. Whether
this cross-pollination of cultural studies with recent histories and
theories of modernity should still be designated cultural studies
or something else (cultural history? cultural theory?) is beyond the
scope of this essay. However the new work on the culture of modernity
is clearly indebted to two key ideas of cultural studies that are often
ignored or misunderstood: an expanded notion of the aesthetic field and
a theory of articulation.
<p>
I will argue that these two ideas define the distinctive parameters of
a cultural studies approach, a thesis that I pursue by contrasting such
an approach to two other ways of linking the aesthetics and politics
of modernity: the sociology of literature and culture and what I call
political formalism. To survey a sample of recent publications in
modernist studies is to realize that all three approaches are currently
in play in critical discourse, even as they lead to differing, and
sometimes diametrically opposed, conclusions. Only by circumscribing
cultural studies and distinguishing it from other methods can we hope
to discern its distinctiveness as a project. Cultural studies is not an
all purpose panacea or the only valid way of thinking about culture and
power. Stripped of its romantic-revolutionary rhetoric and its dubious
messianic teleologies, it can be reenvisioned not as the utopian future
of literary studies but as a specific part of its present.
<p align="center">
* * *
<p>
Much of the work that currently goes under the name of cultural studies
is more accurately filed under other categories. One of these rubrics,
the sociology of literature, is admittedly short on contemporary
charisma. In the United States, especially, it ekes out an existence on
the margins of sociology departments and the peripheral vision of most
literary critics. Yet its endeavors are important and resonate at many key
points with the current catchphrases of literary studies. Sociologists of
literature ask questions about the profession and politics of authorship;
the institution of publishing; the relationship between literature
and the marketplace; the mechanisms of canon formation; the history of
reception; and the networks of connection and influence, discipleship,
and affiliation, all of which shape literary achievement and reputation.

<b></b>

Some sociologists also engage in textual interpretation, exploring
the links between art and ideology and the various ways in which texts
allude to or obscure social, political, or economic realities. In short,
sociologists define art as a field that is shaped by political interests
and struggles for power and legitimation.
<p>
To redescribe some influential trends in literary study as part of
the sociology of literature is to connect these trends to a long and
distinguished lineage of modern thought that stretches from Georg
Luk&aacute;cs to Lucien Goldmann to Pierre Bourdieu.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
In the study of Anglo-American modernism this tradition has been cast
into deep shadow by the dominance of high formalism. As a result,
recent sociological readings of modernism have burst on the scene with
insurrectionary novelty; given the equal newness of cultural studies
and its similar association with politics, it is tempting to equate
the two. And yet, as I hope to show, the sociology of literature and
cultural studies diverge significantly on the question of aesthetics.
<p>
An excellent example of a sociological approach to modernism is Lawrence
Rainey's <i>Institutions of Modernism.</i> "For sociologists," writes
Rainey, "institutions are the structures that interpose themselves between
the individual and society; they are both social subdivisions of human
beings and the regulative principles that organize various zones of
activity and behavior."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Such institutions play a vital role in mediating between the artwork
and its meanings and effects in the public sphere. Rainey's book brings
modernism squarely down to earth. Rather than an austere artifact,
a recondite and semisacred hieroglyph, it is just another commodity
traded in certain venues and social milieus, brokered by key movers and
players, imbricated in the logic of patronage, collecting, speculation,
and investment.
<p>
Thus, Rainey deftly dismantles a reigning myth about the publication
of <i>Ulysses,</i> according to which, as he writes, "Joyce and Beach
are cast as heroic res who have succeeded despite a benighted legal
system, philistine publishers, and a hostile or indifferent public."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
The success of Joyce's novel had less to do with a small band of
prescient readers alert to signs of literary genius than with the
pecuniary interests of speculators in the rare book trade. Through a
meticulous reconstruction of its publication history, Rainey documents
the calculations that went on behind the scenes, showing that most of
the early purchasers of <i>Ulysses</i> were investors buying deluxe
copies with an eye to resale. Modernism did not transcend the market
so much as market itself as transcending the market; its prestige was
closely associated with an aura of expense and exclusivity that bound
together discerning patron-readers and the writers whose work they
supported. At a time when aesthetic norms were under siege, cost became
a crucial touchstone of artistic worth; "the substantial price of the
first edition," writes Rainey of <i>Ulysses,</i> "inevitably dictated
a certain psychic investment, demanding assent to strong claims about
the work's literary or aesthetic value."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
In this and similar examples of modernist criticism we see techniques
and methods from the social sciences being brought to bear on works of
art. Sociology offers a rich repertoire of concepts for contextualizing
and embedding aesthetic objects: institutions and public spheres,
capitalism and commodification, alienation and anomie. To work in
the sociology of literature is to slot artistic works into social and
political frames

<b></b>

rather than the other way around. According to one definition of the
field, literature is of interest only insofar as it can be used "to
reveal, exemplify or interpret social process." Whereas literary criticism
may evoke the critic's fervent identification with the text, "no social
science instills comparable psychic investment in the literary object."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
In fact, sociological attitudes to the literary work are more varied than
such a claim suggests. Early sociologists of literature, for example,
Leo Lowenthal and Lucien Goldmann, drew a firm and unabashed distinction
between great and minor works of art. Such scholars often engaged in close
readings of canonical works, even as they ultimately sought to explain the
internal features of literature as mediated reflections of a social whole.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Often tied to Marxist or neo-Marxist frameworks, such text based
interpretations have fallen out of favor as the weaknesses of reflection
theory have become apparent. Sociologists of literature today are much
more likely to carry out empirically grounded analyses of institutional
mechanisms of production and reception that shape literary meaning.
<p>
There is a similar diversity of sociological responses to the
question of aesthetic value. First of all, a scholar may simply opt
to suspend judgment, claiming that the question of aesthetics goes
beyond her professional purview and disciplinary competence as a social
scientist. This doctrine of "aesthetic neutrality" is perhaps the most
common response within the largely positivist orientation of American
sociology.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Alternatively, she may actively endorse and underwrite traditional
criteria of aesthetic value, as in the example of Lowenthal and
Goldmann cited above. Writing in a similar vein, Diana Laurenson
and Alan Swingewood claim that "on this point, most sociologists of
literature and literary critics are agreed: one studies great writers
precisely because their greatness implies deep insights into the human
and social condition."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Finally and conversely, she may see a sociological approach as actively
undercutting the authority of aesthetic categories by accounting for
them in nonaesthetic terms. Pierre Bourdieu for example adopts this
position when he portrays artistic appreciation as little more than
class-based symbolic violence.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
It is a commonplace of contemporary criticism that cultural studies is
anti-aesthetic, seeking to replace the truth of art with the truth of
politics. (Eugene Goodheart's recent assertion that cultural studies
"means the ideological interpretation of a text" typifies this
quasi-ubiquitous belief.)
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Against this view, I argue that the tradition of cultural studies
reveals not a rejection but an expansion and pluralization of the
aesthetic field; it seeks to enrich our sense of what counts as art
by taking popular culture seriously. Whereas sociology brings out the
political dimensions of even the most rarefied art works, cultural
studies attends to the symbolic, expressive, and aesthetic aspects of
the most mundane cultural artifacts and activities. Unlike sociology,
cultural studies neither ignores, rejects, nor endorses the prevailing
discourse of the aesthetic; rather, it intervenes in that discourse in
order to alter its guiding assumptions and frames of reference. Clearly,
such an intervention goes beyond a strictly Kantian framework; popular
art, almost by definition, does not count as autonomous art. And it
is no doubt because of the ready association of aesthetics with an
exalted corpus of great works that cultural studies has often defined
its approach as political rather than aesthetic.

<b></b>

Yet this dichotomy leads us seriously astray. In its attentiveness to
convention and form&#8212;the <i>how</i> as well as the <i>what</i>
of meaning&#8212;and to the intensely charged affect that surrounds
the experience of popular art, cultural studies owes a clear debt to
techniques of aesthetic interpretation.
<p>
In other words, cultural studies bears the unmistakable marks of its
dual parentage, literary criticism and sociology. It is as much about
form as about content, as much about pleasure as about politics. It does
not abandon close reading but requires it. One of the central tenets of
cultural studies is that popular culture is more than just a delivery
system for ideology, an argument that calls for careful attention to
formal devices and conventions. To equate cultural studies with content
analysis and ideology critique is to seriously shortchange its history
and traditions. Think, for example, of Dick Hebdige's readings of the
avant-garde elements of subcultural style, of Michel de Certeau's interest
in the elusive poetics of everyday life, and of Paul Willis's concern
with the dramaturgical and expressive dimensions of popular culture. Nor
do scholars of cultural studies shy away from value judgments; to read
Angie McRobbie on dance or Simon Frith on popular music is to be persuaded
that such forms matter, not just because they can be read politically,
but because they hook up so powerfully to the imaginative and expressive
lives of their consumers.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
How does this expanded vision of the aesthetic field change our view of
the culture of modernity? As Michael North shows in <i>Reading 1922:
A Return to the Scene of the Modern,</i> it decisively undercuts
the antithesis of art versus society that still tends to shape our
understanding of the modernist period. Charting the multiple flows of
connection and influence among individuals, ideas, and fields that are
often kept apart, North brings together anthropology and philosophy,
psychoanalysis and public sphere theory, avant-garde art and music
hall, archaeology and advertising, in a powerful synoptic sweep. In
this thoroughly entangled and hybridized universe, many once clear-cut
distinctions no longer make much sense. North gives us an anthropology of
modern culture in which the aesthetic bursts out of solitary confinement
in order to saturate the social field. "When even the most mundane product
is marketed as an experience," North writes, "aesthetic considerations
have penetrated the market to an extraordinary degree."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Whereas sociologists stress the determining power of institutions
and systems, North points to the mediation of everyday experience
via mass-produced texts as a quintessential fact of modernity. And in
contrast to literary critics who champion a supremely self-conscious
modernist art against the drab, dulled sensibility of mass culture,
North argues that mediation carried strangeness into the heart of popular
culture and everyday life. The relationship of modern individuals to
their world was filtered through a dizzyingly eclectic array of ideas,
images, and narratives circulating in the public sphere. "As society
becomes progressively aestheticized," writes North, "as audiences begin
to consume imaginative and symbolic materials as they had previously
consumed material goods, then everyday life acquires an inherently ironic
distance from itself" (<i>RAR,</i> 208). Thus, the popular culture of the
1920s was often highly self-reflexive and fully aware of the mediating
status of language and form.

<b></b>

<p>
North steers clear of any explicit reference to cultural studies,
yet the common ground is a shared conviction that popular culture
and everyday life are not just explanatory context, but resonant,
ambivalent, polyvocal text, richly deserving of formal scrutiny in their
own right. "The common opposition of an ironic, aestheticized modernism
to mass culture," he writes, "thus depends on a prior generalization
about mass culture that seriously oversimplifies it" (ibid). We can no
longer cling to a view of modernity as an era when avant-garde and kitsch
faced off across the great divide, while postponing the blurring of high
and low to the period known as postmodernism. Rather, North concludes,
"it may be a certain self-conscious formalism, then, that most closely
links modernist literary works with modern society" (<i>RAR,</i> 210).
<p>
In <i>Reading 1922</i> the culture of modernity is read anew through
the template of aesthetic modernism. Dissonance and estrangement are no
longer distinguishing markers of the modernist masterpiece but are woven
deep into the warp and woof of vernacular culture and everyday life. In
North's compelling analysis, the ordinary is rendered extraordinary;
defamiliarization is no longer just a specialized poetic device but
an inescapable component of modern living. And yet, cultural studies
also reminds us that aesthetics is conjured in the plural. It pushes us
to look beyond our professional predilection for irony and artfulness
and to explore other registers of aesthetic experience: the euphoria of
escapism, the somatic charge of identification, the spine-tingling thrill
of vicarious terror, the cathartic relief of narrative closure. Such
pleasures have not disappeared in the modern era, though they have often
been sidelined by modern criticism.
<p>
Melodrama is an example of a genre once viewed as hackneyed and
old-fashioned that is now being reevaluated as a distinctively modern
form of cultural expression. In <i>Melodrama and Modernity,</i> Ben
Singer carries out a major work of cultural retrieval, uncovering a
largely unknown corpus of American sensational melodrama that spanned the
period from 1880 to 1920. Turn-of-the-century stage melodrama drew on the
latest technological innovations in order to showcase suspenseful scenes
of train wrecks, car races, storms at sea, collapsing hot air balloons,
tornados, Alpine avalanches, and burning buildings. By 1910 it had been
displaced by its cinematic equivalent at the local movie theater where
the spectator enjoyed an even wider range of spectacles and thrills for
a much lower entrance fee.
<p>
Singer shows that the melodramatic aesthetic spoke to modernity's
"experiential qualities, its ideological fluctuations, its cultural
anxieties, its intertextual cross-currents, its social demographics,
and its commercial practices."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Yet it also suffered critical disdain because of its sensationalism
and violence, formulaic yet disjointed plotlines, lack of interest
in psychological depth, and appeal to a mass audience. Accordingly,
melodrama is conspicuously absent from most accounts of modern
aesthetics; indeed, it is often the counterfoil against which the
modernity of modern art is defined.
<p>
According to Singer's useful definition, melodrama is a "cluster
concept" that allows for different combinations of five elements:
strong pathos; heightened emotional expression; moral polarization;
nonclassical narrative mechanics&#8212;outrageous coincidence, convoluted
plotting&#8212;and spectacular effects. Several of these elements also

<b></b>

clash with what are often seen as quintessential elements of modern
style. Thus, the lurid exaggeration and emotional extravagance of
melodrama are patently at odds with a "cool" aesthetic of irony,
knowingness, and detachment. Melodrama also defies the critical
commonplace of a secularized and disenchanted modernity, giving
us a morally schematic and providentially ordered universe, and
inviting a sense of agitation and outrage at the spectacle of extreme
injustice. Moreover, the aesthetics of melodrama hinges on the adrenalin
rush of fast-moving action and cliff-hanging suspense. Such features
receive short shrift in classic theories of modernism, where the
mechanics of plot are disdained as a sop to the masses or a tired
Victorian holdover.
<p>
And yet Singer shows how the formal features of melodrama were intimately
linked to the social conditions of modernity. Contemporary newspapers
repeatedly invoked the sensory overload, heightened stimulation,
and unexpected dangers of modern urban life. These same features were
echoed in the sensational film melodrama, with its thrills and spills,
fleeting impressions, constant shocks, and visceral stimulation. The
plotline of melodrama spoke to anxieties about the unpredictable and
often brutal rhythms of modern capitalism by conjuring up scenarios of
individual powerlessness, social atomization, and ruthless competition,
even as it helped to assuage such anxieties by subsuming them within a
morally legible framework. And the sensational film melodrama was also
a prime vehicle through which to explore a distinctively modern vision
of woman. As intimated by such titles as <i>The Exploits of Elaine,The
Hazards of Helen,The Perils of Pauline,</i> and <i>The Adventures of
Dorothy Dare,</i> melodrama offered a new script of female heroism
that allowed women to engage in brawls and fistts, knock villains
out stone cold, jump from speeding trains, and rescue men from burning
buildings. It captured the paradoxical nature of femaleness at a pivotal
phase of modernity, celebrating the excitement of women's new mobility
outside the home, while also depicting lurid scenarios of assaults,
abductions, intimated rape, and torture arising from their movement
into the mixed-sex, mixed-class, and mixed-ethnicity chaos of the modern
urban milieu.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Singer makes a compelling case for both the formal richness of melodrama
and its quintessential modernity. To make the latter claim, as he points
out in his unusually tough-minded reflections on method, is to confront
difficult questions about how to link aesthetic forms and social norms,
how to shuttle between fine grained textual analysis and larger historical
pictures. How does one justify a claim for the political import or
effects of aesthetic objects? What kind of evidence is needed in order
to present a text as exemplary, emblematic, or symptomatic? What is the
rationale for establishing a structural correlation between very different
phenomena&#8212;for example, a lyric poem and the fact of empire&#8212;and
at what point does correlation serve as persuasive evidence of causality?
<p>
Such questions go to the heart of the differences between cultural studies
and another method with which it is often confused: political formalism. I
coin the term "political formalism" to describe a loose assemblage of
reading techniques that are selectively deployed in approaches ranging
from neo-Marxism to feminism to queer theory. (The word <i>selectively</i>
is important here; my point is to show that political perspectives

<b></b>

can be articulated via a range of differing, often conflicting,
methodologies). In contrast to the sociology of literature, political
formalism insists on the primacy and preeminence of aesthetic form,
which it strives to decipher with a formidable array of analytical
devices. It calls for a patient poring over poetic conventions, a
relentless scrutiny of rative language, a neverending labor of
reading between the lines. This textual hypervigilance is understood
as not just aesthetic work, but also as political work. Form is not
merely a container for content but a vital means of accessing the
invisible intricacies of ideology. Metaphors, binary oppositions,
narrative syntax, and visual schemas all carry patterns of hierarchy,
exclusion, and inequality encoded in their DNA; a close reading of an
innocuous and seemingly inconsequential textual thread can thus lead
deep into the labyrinthian workings of power.
<p>
Alternatively, the plasticity of artistic form may allow it to resist
such power, to set language askew and to estrange us from habitual
schemas. Poststructuralist theories have helped breathe new life into
the study of modernism, such that many of modernism's stylistic features
(poetic language, narrative rupture, heightened ambiguity, nonlinear
syntax) have acquired a newly audacious sheen. Progressive critics who
might once have lamented the elitist, apolitical mind-set of modernism
are now more likely to argue that the politics of modernism lies precisely
in the perverse detours and ellipses of its form.
<p>
For example, in <i>Libidinal Currents: Sexuality and the Shaping of
Modernism,</i> Joseph Boone pursues a meticulous analysis of modernist
fiction from Virginia Woolf to William Faulkner. Boone marshals an
eloquent defense of the technique of close reading as a way of engaging
with what he calls, after Eve Sedgwick, the "numinous and resistant power"
of aesthetic objects.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
In the wayward trajectories and deviant narrative energies of modernism,
he writes, we can find traces of queer alterity and the polymorphously
perverse. In their indeterminate slipperiness and their fascination with
sexual and textual ambiguity, modernist works anticipate many of the
insights of poststructuralism. Their aesthetic is one of contradiction,
ambivalence, and crisis, unleashing a plurality of voices that undermine
the authority of any single master narrative. Thus, the perceived
difficulty and obliqueness of modernist fiction is intimately linked
to its questioning of hegemonic discourses.
<p>
In a parallel project, though one more wary of attributing qualities of
resistance to aesthetic forms, Rachel Blau DuPlessis seeks to connect
modernist poetry to political modernity. DuPlessis also defends the value
of close reading, arguing for a repositioning rather than a rejection
of the formal techniques of New Criticism. Pointing out that contextual
approaches to literature usually slight the qualities and texture of
poetic language, she advocates a "social philology" able to mediate
between social ideologies and aesthetic conventions. Reading the work of a
wide range of modernist poets, DuPlessis aims to show how social meanings
are embedded and condensed in the deep structure of verbal artifice.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
These methods of political formalism differ in key respects from those
of cultural studies, where one does not find the same commitment to
close reading as a source of political insight. At the heart of cultural
studies lies the idea of articulation, best described

<b></b>

as a theory of social correspondences, non-correspondences, and
contradictions or alternatively as a theory of how contexts are made,
unmade, and remade.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
First developed by Ernesto Laclau, the idea of articulation was taken
up in cultural studies in the late 1970s and is widely considered to
be one of its most generative and influential concepts.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
An articulation is a hookup, a temporary linkage, a forged connection
between two or more elements. It is a contingent link between phenomena
that do not share a unifying or essential identity and one that is
unmade and remade over time. "Articulation," writes Larry Grossberg,
"links this practice to that effect, this text to that meaning, this
meaning to that reality, this experience to those politics. And these
links are themselves articulated into larger structures."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Culture is neither organically unified nor radically fragmented and
dispersed; rather, it is a multijointed and multihinged composite of
often disparate elements. Articulation thus seeks to explain how segments
of the social field may join together to form temporary unities without
resorting to a view of the social whole as an expressive totality whose
essential features are mirrored in every one of its parts. The "so-called
unity of a discourse," notes Stuart Hall, "is really the articulation
of different, distinct elements which can be rearticulated in different
ways because they have no necessary 'belongingness.' . . . A theory of
articulation is both a way of understanding how ideological elements
come, under certain conditions, to cohere together within a discourse,
and a way of asking how they do or do not become articulated, at specific
conjunctures, to certain political subjects."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
The idea of articulation has obvious consequences for
interpretation. According to cultural studies, the political import
of a text cannot be inferred from its internal form or logic, but
derives from its position in a constellation of texts, practices, and
interests. The moment of production is less salient than the vagaries
of reception; that a work is a capitalist commodity or the creation
of a male-dominated culture does not determine ahead of time what
its meanings and effects will be. Textual analysis thus needs to be
extensively augmented by an account of practices, and here one may find
one's hypotheses disrupted by disorderly and recalcitrant facts that
do not fit a favorite theory. This constant checking of interpretation
against empirical data is one obvious way that cultural studies departs
from the tradition of aesthetic interpretation. Rather than synthesizing
aesthetics and politics into a textual politics, it juxtaposes and
adjudicates between literary and historical forms of evidence.
<p>
Perhaps we can now see why the readings of cultural studies will never be
deep enough or close enough to satisfy the political formalist. Cultural
studies is often accused of insensitivity to the intricacy, singularity,
and complexity of the aesthetic object. Scholars in the field are, I have
argued, much more attentive to formal questions than such a complaint
suggests. And yet, it is also true that they rarely engage in the kind
of dazzling, chapter-long exegeses of a single work that are so beloved
of political formalists. Such tour de force readings strive to show how
textual details can open up onto social wholes, how thick description of
a particular work can be profoundly revealing of the defining patterns
of a culture.

<b></b>

<p>
From the standpoint of cultural studies, however, there is insufficient
payoff to justify such a degree of attention to aesthetic objects, given
the lack of any necessary or clear-cut correspondence between specific
works and the broader social field. To carry out a symptomatic reading is
thus, in Grossberg's view, to see the world in a grain of sand, to proceed
as if a text were a microcosmic representation of social relations that,
if deciphered correctly, will yield the hidden truth of the social whole.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
By contrast, cultural studies seeks to detotalize the social field and
hence rejects the assumption that any individual work can represent
that field. The political pulse of a culture is not to be found in
the depths of a single work but rather in a mobile and discontinuous
constellation of texts as they play off, influence, and contradict each
other. Rather than reading <i>into</i> texts, cultural studies seeks
to read <i>across</i> texts.
<p>
Laura Doan's <i>Fashioning Sapphism,</i> for example, accumulates a
formidable density of historical detail to question the myth of the
lesbian as a transgressive outsider and martyr to modernity. Indeed, in
a deft act of defamiliarization, she shows that our common sense schemas
of gender and sexuality were once conred otherwise. By embedding
photographs of Radclyffe Hall and other mannish women within a thick
description of the visual culture of the 1920s, Doan shows that what now
seem like provocatively lesbian images were often read very differently,
as a sign of modernity and up-to-dateness, or bohemian eccentricity, or
aristocratic hauteur. It is precisely because of the multivalent coding
of such images that Hall was such a respected and respectable re, her
lifestyle widely feted in women's magazines and the popular press. Rather
than delving into the hidden meanings of an aesthetic object&#8212;<i>The
Well of Loneliness</i>&#8212;in order to show how it supports or subverts
modern sexual ideology, Doan traces out its often surprising articulations
with other texts and practices to reveal that modern sexual ideology
was itself more differentiated than we may have realized.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, even as the mainstream of cultural studies has often maligned or
misconstrued the modern, its own method of articulation offers an implicit
rebuke to such knee-jerk dismissals. In fact, another common complaint
about cultural studies&#8212;that it relies on a self-righteous rhetoric
of unmasking and debunking&#8212;strikes me as largely misplaced. For
example, Stefan Collini writes in a notorious review of the field:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
texts are interrogated (a favourite term) to demonstrate how they distort,
occlude (another favourite), or in other ways inadvertently reveal the
ideological pressure which shaped them. These pressures are in turn
taken to be symptomatic of the way in which power operates in society
to the systematic disadvantage of certain marginalized or oppressed
groups. One effect of these combined developments is that cultural
studies, particularly as practised in the United States, is in constant
danger of turning into "Grievance Studies."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While this caricature is not unrecognizable, cultural studies strikes me
as less guilty of the charge of holier-than-thou political correctness
than other contemporary critical methods. Because it sees meaning
as thoroughly enmeshed in practice, it does not conceive of texts as
malevolent, all-powerful devices for the interpellation and manipulation

<b></b>

of human subjects. And because it is interested in the making and
remaking of culture in daily life, it is not especially drawn to a
self-righteous rhetoric of unmasking or a hypervigilant hermeneutics
of suspicion.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Let me illustrate this point with some concluding comments on a
forthcoming book by Liz Conor entitled <i>The Spectacular Modern
Woman.</i> Conor takes as her subject the pervasiveness of the female
image in modernity and as an index of modernity. She begins from a
premise familiar to feminist scholars: that modern mechanisms of looking
are predicated on gender asymmetry, such that it is women, above all,
who are defined by their visibility. The best-known development of this
insight is of course the feminist formalism of Laura Mulvey.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Historically inflected versions of this thesis concur with Mulvey's
view of woman as object, but refer to the changing perceptual field of
modernity rather than the psychodynamics of male sexuality, invoking
such ideas as the society of the spectacle and the modern hegemony of
vision. In this view, women are barred from the modern subject position
of the spectator because of their existence as embodied, specularized,
objects.
<p>
Conor concurs that becoming a spectacle was deeply implicated in modern
forms of subjectivity. For women in particular, to enter the modern
scene was to make a spectacle of oneself, to apprehend oneself and
be apprehended as an image. But Conor rejects the usual reading of
this fact in terms of a subject/object dichotomy anchored in sexual
difference. To become a spectacle, she insists, is not to be barred
from the role of spectator, nor is it to be consigned to a passive or
inactive condition. Conor's development of the notion of "appearing"
is a conceptual milestone in rethinking the position of women in the
visual scene of modernity. Appearing refers to the ways in which women
articulated themselves as modern subjects by constituting themselves
as spectacles. That is to say, it is a theory of representation that
allocates an active verb to those who are seen by others and thus opens
up a space for addressing female agency, desire, and investment in the
image. Appearing, writes Conor, is precisely the conflation of object
and subject, the syncretic moment of the subject experiencing itself as
object or the object experiencing itself as subject.
<p>
Conor's extraordinarily rich compendium of archival material suggests
there was no clear-cut correspondence between female visibility and
male power. The rapidly multiplying images of the modern woman in film,
advertising, magazines, photographic portraits, and display windows
unleashed a wide range of responses from voyeuristic pleasure to moral
outrage. Female visibility could be articulated as sexual availability,
political assertiveness, personal vulnerability, women's association with
the commodity, or a lost essence of femininity. Tracing out a typology
of images of the modern woman, including the city girl, the flapper,
the business girl, the beauty contestant, the screen star, and the
screen-struck girl, Conor shows how feminine spectacle carried a volatile
burden of meaning as connoting both verisimilitude and illusion, both
the pleasures and the perils of modernity. This exploding repertoire of
images was in turn taken up, negotiated, and modified by women themselves
in their own quest to be modern.

<b></b>

<p>
Conor's work is a consummate calibration of female visibility as
allowing for new possibilities of self-fashioning, sexual expression,
mobility, and display as well as for surveillance, harassment, and
punitive self-scrutiny. Aboriginal women, for example, were presented
as visual anomalies on the modern scene, unable to enter modernity as
self-conscious subjects invested in their own image. Conor reproduces a
remarkable 1928 cartoon showing an encounter between a young Australian
woman and the Aboriginal servant "Mary" who is scrubbing her floor. The
mistress is elegant, slim, striking; she is dressed in the garb of
an aviatrix, stylishly turned out in airplane goggles as well as high
heels. By contrast, as Conor notes, "Mary sits in a puddle in sartorial
indefinition, her hair unruly, her features projected in a kind of
simian, fleshy excess compared to the precisely rendered lines of her
missus." The mistress has just returned from her far-flung plane travels,
soaring icarus-like into the brave new world of scientific modernity. Her
maid crouches on the ground, firmly rooted in the drudgery of domestic
space and the na&iuml;ve literalism of primitive belief. Conor concludes,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Mary is unfashionable because, as primitive, she is torpid, against the
visual flux and transience of modernity. She evinces no mastery over her
appearance. . . . Her mistress stands, almost in long shot before her
like a Screen Star, holding her gaze and not bothering to return it. Her
understated features are cool and reserved; she appears modern. Through
these binarisms, Mary does not really "appear" as primitive. She does not
appear in the sense I have been using the term&#8212;she does not emit
the signs of intentionality and control over her visual effects. Nor
does she evince an awareness of the modern perceptual field and how
to achieve visual congruence within it. Mary appears as "primitive"
through not appearing.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As Conor shows, some forms of articulation are widespread and relatively
stable, sutured into place by deep-rooted political interests and
sedimented ways of seeing. For example, Australian legislators of the
1920s debated the merits of banning aboriginal people from movie theaters,
on the grounds that their na&iuml;ve understanding of the image would
cause their passions to be dangerously inflamed by what they saw on
screen. Here again we see how the aboriginal woman was deemed to lack
the self-consciousness that would allow her to appear as an authentically
modern subject.
<p align="center">
* * *
<p>
I take it as self-evident that not every commentary on the aesthetics and
politics of modernity can be neatly slotted into the three categories or
ideal types that I have outlined. Boundaries exist only in order to be
crossed and categories are never pure. Indeed, a hybridization of critical
methods can be highly productive, providing it reveals some knowledge and
critical awareness of the competing frameworks that are being juxtaposed
and put into play. I would contrast such a self-conscious interrogation
of method to the practice of naming any political reading of a text
"cultural studies," often in disregard of thirty years of debates about
methodology within the field.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
For example, in popular surveys of cultural studies such as Patrick
Brantlinger's <i>Crusoe's Footprints,</i> one can find Stuart Hall cheek
by jowl with Elaine Showalter and Larry Grossberg nestling up to Roland
Barthes. Such mappings of the field strike me as both too broad and too
narrow in their ambitions. On the one hand, by labeling virtually any
political approach to literature or culture as an example of cultural
studies, they skim over fundamental disagreements about frameworks and
methods. On the other hand, even as lip service is paid to cultural
studies as an interdisciplinary project, almost every scholar cited in
such surveys turns out to be based in a department of English literature.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
My own view is that methodological similarities among scholars in
different disciplines are more salient to the definition of cultural
studies than the mere fact of being a literary critic who is interested
in politics. Liz Conor, for example, is a cultural historian, while Ben
Singer teaches in a film and communication program. Sociologists and
anthropologists have also played a crucial role in redrawing the map of
modernity via the method of cultural studies.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Such a method, I've been arguing, is characterized by a distinctive and
productive tension between an expanded notion of the aesthetic field
and a model of articulation that draws on social theory and historical
method. This disciplinary hybridity is jeopardized by attempts to
turn cultural studies into the future of literary studies, a move that
will all too quickly sever its links to the social sciences and turn
it into a form of pan-semiotics. (We can see such a future prered
in Jonathan Culler's recent assertion that cultural studies is just
another word for structuralism).
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Hence to present cultural studies as the telos, redeemer, or utopian
future of literary studies strikes me as doubly misguided. It is bad
news for literature departments because it rides roughshod over the many
interests of scholars&#8212;formalist, rhetorical, philosophical, literary
historical, bibliographical, deconstructive, Marxist, psychoanalytical,
etc.&#8212;that cannot be subsumed within a cultural-studies rubric,
however defined. If cultural studies were to apply its own theory
of articulation toward a more sophisticated account of institutional
knowledges and the history of the disciplines, it would soon recognize the
inadequacy of many of its quick-fire pronouncements about the reactionary
role of literary studies.
<p>
Moreover, this argument is even worse news for cultural studies, undoing
the very interdisciplinarity it seeks to support by arrogating cultural
studies as the property of literature departments and designating English
professors as self-evident experts on culture. Such a move would be
especially unfortunate for modernist studies, where interdisciplinary work
is still in its infancy. Modernity is one of the few terms that resonates
across the disciplines, and yet there is remarkably little dialogue
between sociologists, political theorists, historians, anthropologists,
art historians, and literary critics about their differing conceptions
of the modern. The project of cultural studies, surely, is neither to
overthrow nor to transcend the disciplines. Rather, it is to encourage
forms of traffic across disciplinary lines that will in turn expand our
understanding of the multifarious and many-sided cultures of modernity.

<p>
What is it about T.S. Eliot's putative anti-Semitism that provokes
such prolonged and extravagant response&#8212;attacks of increasing
stridency from his critics, apologetics of increasing imaginativeness
from his defenders? Readers of  are doubtless
familiar with the latest burst of warfare occasioned by Ronald Schuchard's
spirited January 2003 defense of Eliot, "Burbank with a Baedeker, Eliot
with a Cigar," published along with by-and-large critical responses by
distinguished modernists. So let me instead offer as evidence of the
persistent power of this controversy the following datum. I recently
co-edited a special issue of the <i>Michigan Quarterly Review</i> entitled
<i>Jewish in America,</i> and my fellow editor and I were surprised to
discover that no fewer than five submissions contained allusions to,
or denunciations of, Eliot. We accepted one of these, a poem by Roger
Kamenetz entitled "The Lower Case Jew," in which Eliot is put on trial by
a heavenly rabbinical court for anti-Semitism. Prosecuted by Bleistein and
defended by Sir Ferdinand Klein, Eliot is found guilty and sentenced to
attend "Hyam Plutzik's grandson's bar mitzvah / . . . [where] he'll hora
with Rachel n&eacute;e Rabinovitch / And kazatzki with Allen Ginsberg /
who will give him wet sloppy kisses." ("Oh, I am bound to a bagel of
fire!" Kamenetz's Eliot cries in response to this doleful fate.)
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Cruel as such a <i>contrapasso</i> might seem&#8212;it nails Eliot on
just about every ground I can imagine, including what Kamenetz sees
as his snobbery and his panicked homophobia&#8212;it was nevertheless
striking that we received no submission similarly indicting Pound,
Fitzgerald, Wharton, Hemingway, or Cather, to

<b></b>

mention other writers of Eliot's vintage whose attitudes towards Jews
were not always respectful.
<p>
Taken together, Schuchard and Kamenetz's responses, polar opposites
in every other way, pose two similar questions: why now, why still,
Eliot? And what, if anything, does the presence of Jews as equal players
in the game of culture-making upon which Schuchard comments and to
which Kamenetz's poem testifies mean not only for Eliot scholarship,
but for our new, reconring sense of Eliot's era?
<p>
To address the first of these, as I tried to suggest in my 2000 book,
<i>The Temple of Culture,</i> the controversy is rooted in the absolute
preeminence Eliot assumed in the booming literary academy of the 1940s
and 1950s, especially in America.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
To be a college professor of English in this period was, perforce, to
come to terms with a model of literary history and cultural value that
placed Eliot, the work Eliot esteemed (e.g. metaphysical poetry), and
the religious vision that Eliot affirmed at the center of critical and
pedagogic practice. And such a period was also, and not uncoincidentally,
the period in which an Anglo-American professorate which had closed
itself off to Jews, frequently on the not-un-Eliotic argument that one
needed to have a thorough and deep&#8212;a feeling&#8212;knowledge of
Christianity in order to understand a literary tradition suffused with
that faith, began to open up to this previously excluded group. Eliot's
responses to Jews rankled many Jewish critics then.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
They continue to do so, perhaps all the more vigorously as Jewish critics
have abandoned the tactics of passing, accommodation, or internalization
that marked their early years in the academy.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
But more, it seems to me, is at stake in this continuing battle. For
those critical of the New Critical canon and the rhetoric that
informs its continuing study, Eliot offers a case study in that
canon's complicity with prejudice, reaction, and the worst episodes in
twentieth-century history. For those who wish to defend the canon that
Eliot did so much to put into institutional practice, his problematic
moments need to be explained. Battling over Eliot, in other words, is
a way of battling over the nature and shape of literary experience and
expression itself, and has been for at least the past two generations. It
should not come as a surprise&#8212;it should in fact come as a
relief&#8212;that this battle continues even at the moment when cultural
studies has challenged the salience and value of the literary itself.
<p>
As for my second question: what does the new evidence that Schuchard
has brought to the table mean? That issue ultimately opens out onto not
only the literature, but also the ethno-racial dynamics of literary
modernism itself. Setting aside his strained explanations of the
worst of Eliot's anti-Semitic tropes and references, Schuchard has
some interesting evidence to offer. He's clearly shown that Eliot's
social and intellectual life intersected with that of many Jews without
his expressing visibly anti-Semitic opinions and without their overtly
shunning him. And, following up the discovery (generously acknowledged)
of Ranen Omer-Sherman with hard work in the archive, he's shown that Eliot
engaged in a long correspondence with American Jewish intellectual (and
fellow Harvard alum) Horace Kallen which ended with Eliot's expressing
disappointment at Kallen's militant secularism.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
There is clearly more such evidence to be added to the record, and it
comports with the main outlines of Schuchard's argument

<b></b>

(although it will do nothing to mollify his critics).
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
To be frank, the implications of this evidence aren't all that
earth-shattering. But the evidence does offer us an interesting
opportunity to reassess a curious feature of the phenomenon we call
literary modernism: namely, the complicated lines of personal and
professional relation between Jews and gentiles, often crossing over
between amity, enmity, desire, and rivalry, reflected in both the lived
experience of modernist writers and in their work. These phenomena give
us an opportunity to move through and beyond the latest flaring of the
great Eliot debate, to use the issues raised by it not to resolve the
question "was he or wasn't he?" ("he was, but so what? they all were,"
is more or less my position) but to suggest something fundamental
about modernism itself: that along with relations with such recently
canonized reifications as gender and race, modernism's distinctive
literary investments and complex self-positioning may be seen as deeply
implicated in&#8212;fundamentally structured around&#8212;what the
nineteenth century called "the Jewish question."
<p>
<p>
One place to start to address not only the question of Eliot's
overdetermined relations with Jews, and modernism's as well, is not the
salons and little magazines of London or Greenwich Village, where he and
his generation were encountering writers, intellectuals, publishers,
and artists who were assimilating Jews. Rather, we can scroll back a
bit and start, as so much of twentieth-century American thought does,
at Eliot's Harvard&#8212;the Harvard, as well, of Robert Frost, Wallace
Stevens, Gertrude Stein, and, at least in fiction, Quentin Compson and
Shreve McCannon. For in addition to the many things that this Harvard
was&#8212;the center of New England and hence national intellectual
life; a grand experiment in grafting a modern research university
onto a liberal arts college; a cradle of pragmatist philosophy and the
scientific study of the mind&#8212;it also served simultaneously as a
home for Jewish students and as an incubator of racist, anti-immigrant,
and anti-Jewish thinking. Harvard, like Columbia, Chicago, and Penn,
was located in a major metropolitan area to which Eastern European Jews
thronged; its undergraduate admissions policies, at least until the 1920s,
were relatively open, and Jewish students like Bernard Berenson (whose
father was a local peddler) and German-born Horace Kallen found a tolerant
home there. At the same time, however, Harvard was also a bastion of race
thinking of the most problematic kind. Major res in the elaboration
of American race and eugenics theory included such Harvard luminaries as
Louis Agassiz, Professor of Geology and Zoology until his death in 1873,
and Charles Davenport, Harvard B.A. and Ph.D., instructor of biology
until he departed in 1899, soon to become one of the most important
res in the eugenics movement. In the 1910s, Harvard offered no fewer
than four courses in the principles of eugenics. Indeed, so pervasive
was the connection of America's most prestigious university with this
hot new form of academic thought that Eliot's cousin, President William
Charles Eliot, was named a vice-president of the First International
Congress of Eugenics in 1912.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
These atmospherics clearly influenced a number of its students: for
example, Lathrop Stoddard, author of the anti-immigrant tract parodied
in Fitzgerald's <i>Great Gatsby,The Rising Tide of Color</i> ,
graduated from Harvard Law School in 1908 and received the M.A. and
Ph.D., in History in

<b></b>

1910 and 1912; it was while at Harvard, he later said, that his work
turned in an explicitly racialist direction.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Eugenics and race-theory comported with explicitly anti-immigrant and
anti-Jewish sentiment and activity. In 1894, three Harvard College alumni,
Charles Warren, Robert DeCourcy Ward, and Prescott Farnsworth Hall,
founded the Immigration Restriction League, which included in its number
many other prominent alumni and professors, including Abbott Lawrence
Lowell, later president of the University. The efforts of the League,
buttressed by the nascent eugenics movement led by Davenport, climaxed
in the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924, shepherded through congress
by Harvard alumnus (and former student of Henry Adams), Henry Cabot
Lodge. Also at this time, President Lowell sought to institute quotas
on Jewish admissions; his efforts blocked, he advocated geographical
ones. T.S. Eliot himself articulated the essential logic behind these
quotas&#8212;that too great numbers of intellectually competitive
but undercultured Jews were distorting the student body&#8212;when he
complained, in a 1915 letter to his cousin Elinor Hinckley, of having
encountered "the clever Jew undergraduate mind at Harvard, wide but
disorderly reading, intense but confused thinking, and utter absence of
background and balance and proportion."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
To be sure, there's no one-to-one correspondence between the tides of
racist, eugenicist, anti-immigrant or anti-Semitic sentiment, and Eliot's
own experience there. He made friends with Horace Kallen, as Schuchard
reminds us. And he does not seem to have read deeply in race theory or
proto-eugenics at Harvard, although he did imbibe a considerable degree
of comparative anthropology that was to have unfortunate applications
in the dogma, later appropriated by the Nazis, of Aryanism.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Moreover, it's important to remind ourselves that Eliot's poetry reflects
this milieu with a certain degree of ambivalence. As Lyndall Gordon
reminds us, he lampoons high-toned Harvard ways&#8212;the drawing rooms
best known for the taking of toast and tea&#8212;and haunted the streets
of Roxbury (in which one of the <i>Preludes</i> was originally set) and
North Cambridge in search, presumably, of a gritty urban authenticity
that contrasts with the effete hermeticism of the world chronicled in
<i>Prufrock</i> or <i>Portrait of a Lady.</i>
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
But at least considered in its ethnoracial guise, this gesture is perhaps
more loaded than it might appear: unmentioned by Gordon, many of the
areas into which the young college student wandered and from which he
took impressions of fin-de-si&egrave;cle deliquescence were precisely
the ones in which Russian-born immigrant Jews congregated.
<p>
All this is not to indict Eliot for his reading, the attitudes of his
peers, or his slumming&#8212;I'd hate to be held responsible for the
currents of thought in my Northwestern University dorm, circa 1976, and
the ethnoracial dimensions of my own fascinations with Chicago street
life in that time would not, I'm sure, bear much scrutiny. But it is to
suggest something about the world he, and much of American modernism,
came from and the baggage he&#8212;and it&#8212;carried into the charged
political and social atmosphere of London, Paris, and New York. Race
thinking and a tendency to equate immigrants&#8212;especially Jewish
immigrants&#8212;with the decline of Western culture; responses towards
Jews that mixed a sense of tolerance and the possibility of friendship

<b></b>

with the sense that those Jews were somehow overly competitive,
lacking balance, background, poise: these were the attitude to which
young men and women at Harvard and Radcliffe were exposed in their most
impressionable years, as they were at Yale, Columbia, and Princeton,
which imposed quotas on Jewish undergraduates in the 1920s.
<p>
Indeed, the encounters on the terrain of high culture between aspiring
Jews and ambivalent gentiles was not only a Harvard phenomenon, or
even a university one; nor are they of interest for merely biographical
reasons. Rather, such encounters are an explicit theme of much of the
writing of the first three decades of the twentieth century. Consider the
following. In 1905, Edith Wharton published <i>The House of Mirth,</i>
in which the downward path of a self-destructive gentile woman, Lily
Bart, is plotted against the upward curve described by the career of a
Jewish financier, Simon Rosedale; that the ascendancy of the latter in
the corrupt and attenuated world of turn-of-the-century New York is on
Wharton's mind may be best indicated by the fact that the working title
for the novel was "The Year of the Rose." In 1907, Henry James published
an account of the Lower East Side of New York in his travel book, <i>The
American Scene,</i> which contrasted the seemingly barbaric language and
customs of the swarming Jews to his own; but his account also located in
them an energy and an intellectual power which he acutely felt lacking
in both himself and his gentry class. In 1925, F. Scott Fitzgerald
published <i>The Great Gatsby,</i> a novel in which a Jewish gangster,
Meyer Wolfsheim ("the man who fixed the 1919 World Series") weaves a
vast underworld web around a maniacally self-improving Minnesotan veteran
and Oxford graduate, Jay Gatsby n&eacute;e Gatz. Wolfsheim is a sinister
but oddly sympathetic re, with cuff links made of human molars but
a kind word for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; after the latter's death; but
he is untouched by Gatsby's demise, and remains a shadowy but successful
player behind the scenes, running one criminal enterprise after another
from his office at the Swastika Holding Company. In 1926, Willa Cather
published <i>The Professor's House,</i> a novel in which a middle-aged
professor with the resonant name of Godfrey St. Peter faces what can only
be called a mid-life crisis as his wife and children prepare to move
into an extravagant new mansion. He spends much of his time in his old
house thinking of his former student Tom Outland, a perfect paragon of
a man killed in World War I. St. Peter's daughter who was betrothed to
Outland, has married instead a Jewish entrepreneur named Louis Marsellus
who has brilliantly marketed Outland's invention, the Outland vacuum,
and enriched St. Peter's increasingly vulgar, materialistic clan. Also
in 1926, Ernest Hemingway published <i>The Sun Also Rises,</i> in which
Jake Barnes, the castrated, war-wounded narrator, is shadowed by Robert
Cohn, the alcoholic, former boxing champion at Princeton, now besotted
with Lady Brett Ashley, with whom he has a brief affair about which
he whines for most of the novel and whose new boyfriend, a matador,
he savagely beats at the end of the novel.
<p>
Taken together, then, American modernism (which begins, in my view,
with James) presents a remarkably consistent pattern of response
with respect to the re of the Jew, a response sustained over two
generations. And this response is encoded in narrative form as well as
ideational content. The Lower East Side Jew is to James as Rosedale

<b></b>

is to Lily as Wolfsheim is to Gatsby as Marsellus is to St. Peter as
Cohn is to Jake Barnes; significant if complexly wrought doubles. Thus,
Rosedale as a "plump rosy man of the blonde Jewish type" seems to be
the slender, dark-haired Lily's antithesis and his desire repulses her;
but as their fortunes shift and paths cross, they briefly meet in the
middle, fellow outsiders in the gossipy, status-conscious world of New
York. Robert Cohn, who discovers in boxing an antidote to his sense of
outsiderdom as a Jew at Princeton, crosses romantic and professional
paths with the novel's castrated journalist narrator Jake Barnes
and then repeatedly rediscovers precisely that sense of outsiderness
again in the circle of Lost Generation expatriates in which they both
move. Wolfsheim is an immigrant (he still speaks with an accent) who
uses the Oxford-educated veteran Jay Gatsby as a front for his various
schemes, but Gatsby, like Wolfsheim, stands curiously without the social
whirl that he has entered (when Nick Carraway first meets him, he seems
to be a guest at his own party). The novel's lachrymose conclusion
metaphorically positions Gatsby, too, as a kind of a reverse immigrant,
a Midwestern emigr&eacute; who has to come to the East in order to find
his green-lighted dream. Marsellus is obviously the world-withdrawing,
aesthete St. Peter's antithesis just as Outland was his wish-fulfillment
version of himself; yet even St. Peter admits that the Outland vacuum
could not have been made into a success without Marsellus. Tellingly,
it is Marsellus's words that serve as the epigraph to the novel, not
those of Outland or St. Peter.
<p>
In the works of all these writers, we see a remarkably similar relational
logic, juxtaposing gentile and Jew and thereby defining all the things
that are missing in the former&#8212;and all the things, for better or
worse, supplied by the latter. Thus the gentiles are marked by effeminacy
or at least ineffectuality, particularly in the massively restructuring
postwar world. They are war-wounded or sexually dysfunctional; ridden
by obsessive but fallible passions (Lily's for Selden, Gatsby's for
Daisy, Jake's for Brett), and marked by an inclination towards dreamy
aestheticism. Precisely the opposite qualities are associated with the
Jews, who are sexually vital if not voracious, and capable of sustained
energy and prodigious success in the ordinary world. But there is one
highly significant overlap between the two categories. With the exception
of Wolfsheim, who is comfortably and vulgarly himself, all these Jews have
aspirations to enter the precincts of high culture that had previously
been the precincts of the attenuated and attenuating gentile elites
whose lack of faith even in their own tradition is summarized by the
name of Cather's protagonist, "God-free" St. Peter. Rosedale has an eye
for bric-a-brac; Marcellus leads the family on a Jamesian trip to Paris;
Cohn is an aspiring, and appallingly unsuccessful, novelist, and so on.
<p>
The secret story of modernism these texts tells, then, is of an increasing
contact between Jews and gentiles leading to complex relations of
mutual desire and emulation, rivalry and respect, in the terrain of
cultural achievement: Rosedale, Marcellus, and Cohn, want what Lily,
St. Peter, and Barnes have, and the latter (and their creators) treat
them with a mixture of affection, condescension, and contempt. And here,
it seems to me, we can link historical experience with literary/cultural
representation in a fairly explicit way, for these relations allegorize
the experiences of the authors who

<b></b>

have created them. As one set of outsiders&#8212;Midwestern Americans like
Eliot, Hemingway, Cather, for example&#8212;sought to make their mark
in the sphere of cultural distinction, they encountered in the salons
and cenacles of Paris or Greenwich Village, in the little magazines,
in the publishing houses, in the university classrooms (but not the
faculty lounges) another set of deracinated outsiders elbowing their
way in alongside them, namely assimilating Jews. The ensuing struggle
structures their work. Gentile writers, particularly in the 1920s, create
narratives that, despite their experimental tenor, identify their brood
with the values of the <i>ancien regime,</i> with the cultural politics
of nostalgia, superannuation, world-weary aestheticism, romantic idealism,
and the like. These texts simultaneously and by the same gesture identify
Jews not only as embodiments of modernity or materialism (this alone
is a not-unexpected development, surely) but as culture-vultures, avid
seekers after the legitimacy of taste or imaginative production, who are
all too frequently rewarded for their lack of imaginative amplitude and
cultural sophistication, not punished for it.
<p>
This pattern of representation isn't <i>overtly</i> anti-Semitic, despite
lapses into anti-Semitic rhetoric of the deepest hue on the order of,
say, C&eacute;line or Pound: human molar cuff links indeed! But it can't
be freed from the charge of anti-Semitism either; indeed, on the deepest
level, it is structurally so. To these writers, the re of the Jew is
an overdetermined one, freighted with all the anxieties and rivalries
they were experiencing in the new literary and cultural marketplace,
and all the more loaded because through that re, they also had
to reckon with the identification, as old as Matthew Arnold, between
the alienated artist-intellectual and the assimilating Jew. Indeed,
it is perhaps the last of these that is most persistently provoking,
and can explain most fully the obsession with the Jew that marks the
imagination of this generation of American modernists. For (and here I
am adapting an argument made with respect to Eliot, Joyce, and Pound by
Bryan Cheyette and Maud Ellmann
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>) insofar as writers of Eliot's generation defined themselves as
international rather than local in their interests; as exiles,
outsiders, others, &eacute;migr&eacute;s, wanderers&#8212;insofar,
that is, as they defined themselves as what we have come to think of as
"moderns"&#8212;their very self-conception made them look suspiciously
like the Jews with whom they were competing for cultural legitimacy
and artistic status. And the result is the response I have tried to
detail above, in which Jews may be&#8212;almost always are&#8212;oddly
sympathetic characters, certainly far from anti-Semitic stereotypes, yet
are also positioned as illegitimate questers after the cultural authority
and writerly excellence to which these American &eacute;migr&eacute;s,
internal and external, aspired.
<p>
Thinking in these terms has two consequences, one of them specific to the
Eliot problem, the other, opening up onto a consideration of literary
modernism at large. As far as the first is concerned, placing Eliot's
response to Jews in this broad conration of thought resituates the
debate about his anti-Semitic expressions from their occurrence to their
motives, from the question of whether he was an anti-Semite to where his
anti-Semitism might come from and what it might mean. This is not to say
that there aren't spasmodic and quite disgusting anti-Semitic tropes in
his poetry for which no amount of apologetics should acquit him; indeed,
when compared to the contemporaries

<b></b>

I have described above, the ugliness of those tropes becomes clearer. But
it also is to say that Eliot's poetry of this era comports itself to
the pattern I have sketched above. It's filled with images of masculine
distress, castration, ineffectuality, aestheticism, or obsolescence
and populated with Jewish characters like Rachel n&eacute;e Rabinovitch
or Bleistein who contain a certain sexuality, if not vitality, and are
connected by a set of allusions, conscious and unconscious, that point
back to the &eacute;migr&eacute; poet himself. Consider, as just one
example, the first named of these. Defined by her Russian last name,
Rabinovitch, as one of the surging hordes of <i>Ost-juden,</i> her first
name also identifies her as a Jew, and a Jew of a particular type. That
name ties back to the nineteenth-century French actress Rachel who,
as I have tried elsewhere to suggest, provides one important model
for the Arnoldian intellectual as well as for Henry James's maniacally
self-fashioning actress Miriam Rooth in <i>The Tragic Muse.</i> Like
Arnold's or James's Rachel, Rachel n&eacute;e Rabinovitch is a partially
assimilating Other, "uptorn" as Arnold puts it, from her own origins
but not yet arrived at a new one: if she was born as Rabinovitch,
what, other than Rachel, or perhaps "Rachel," has she become? She is
thus a re not only of horrific appetency, but also a re of
socio-cultural liminality, and as such mirrors another assimilating
re performing on the English stage of Arnold and James, confronting
his own essential rootlessness,
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
and embarking upon an enterprise of assimilative refashioning:
T.S. Eliot himself.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
More broadly, this phenomenon suggests one way in which we might want
to rethink the nature and possibilities of the category "American
modernism" itself. Wonderful recent work has identified the modernist
enterprise with complex engagements with gender; with race; with
non-heteronormative sexuality. In doing so, it has supplemented the
modernist canon&#8212;Eliot, Joyce, Stevens, Pound, et al&#8212;by
constructing alternative canons that emphasize different aspects of the
modernist enterprise, that have foregrounded various different sets
of writers. Faulkner and/or the Harlem Renaissance is crucial in one
reckoning of the modernist enterprise; Stein and other queer writers
in another, and so on. My response to the Eliot controversy suggests
a different approach to the same revisionary enterprise, one which
would not so much define a new "Jewish" modernism (Stein, Mina Loy,
Louis Zukofsky, Henry Roth, Charles Reznikoff), but rather stress the
ethnoracial dimension of the tropes, assumptions, and imaginative patterns
that structured not only the modernist movement, but the academic study
of literature itself. First, within the circles that created literary
modernism in the 1920s and 1930s; then, in the university English
departments that reified modernism's critical techniques and canonized
its central texts in the 1940s and 1950s; departments which then, in the
1960s and 1970s, proclaimed its death at the hands of the post-modern (a
term circulated, it might be added, by arch-Jew Leslie Fiedler&#8212;his
revenge against the gentile tradition): in all of these various sites,
the social and imaginative encounter between Jews and gentiles shaped
the very terms by which literary modernism and the academic study of
literature were built.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
In this sense, and in this sense only, Eliot at his most problematic
perhaps can be given the last word. With respect to the complex,
charged affective and social matrix out of which modernism emerged,
the study of literature was institutionalized, and both

<b></b>

questioned and complicated; with respect, that is, to the dominant
tendencies in American literature and criticism of the last fifty years,
"the Jew"&#8212;the set of imaginative constructions and deconstructions
attendant upon the entry of Jewish intellectuals into the terrain of
high culture&#8212;truly <i>is</i> underneath the lot.

Foremost among these, of course, was the irrepressible Karl Shapiro, who
was also notoriously outspoken in his response to Pound. In a symposium in
<i>Commentary,</i> "The Jewish Writer and the English Literary Tradition,"
for example, Shapiro wrote: "I have always been able to 'understand'
Chaucerian and even Shakespearean anti-Semitism as lingering concepts
of the medieval mind. Naturally, I make no such concessions to the
modern literary anti-Semite, however great an artist he happens to
be. . . . When Eliot perpetuates the myth of the bestial Jew, without
taking the pains elsewhere to mollify this image, he commits an outrage
against his Jewish contemporaries." [<i>Commentary</i> 7 (October 1949):
369-70]. For an uninhibited attack on Eliot and his critical hegemony
on other grounds, see "T.S. Eliot: The Death of Literary Judgment" in
Shapiro, <i>In Defense of Ignorance</i> (New York: Random House, 1952,
1960) 35-60. Here is a sample of his "take" on Eliot:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Eliot invented a Modern World which exists only in his version of it;
this world is populated by Eliot's followers and is not a reality. The
Eliot population consists of a handful of critics and professors and
a few writers of Eliot's generation, though one would think, reading
modern criticism and teaching from modern literary textbooks, that there
really is a kingdom of Modern Poetry in which T.S. Eliot is the absolute
monarch and Archbishop of Canterbury in one.

within Judaic studies, of so-called Jewish cultural studies&#8212;I
am thinking here of the work <i>inter alia,</i> of Daniel and Jonathan
Boyarin; and more generally, the rise of the study of Jewishness in the
context of the questions of gender and race particularly evident in the
oeuvre of Sander Gilman, but crucial as example and provocation to us all.

In a recent biography of the late Leslie Fiedler [Mark Royden Winchell,
<i>"Too Good to be True": The Life and Work</i> (Columbia, MO. :
University of Missouri Press, 2002)], for example, Mark Winchell recounts
the details of an unpublished early correspondence between the young
Fiedler (who was quite unsparing about Eliot later in his life) and
the distinguished poet; and one can note in his paraphrase of Eliot's
response both the outlines of Schuchard's own defense and an echo of
Eliot's correspondence with Kallen:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Fiedler dealt directly with [the anti-Semitism of the literary canon]
in a letter to T.S. Eliot, dated, December 13, 1948. Although that letter
has not been preserved, Eliot's reply of January 14, 1949, is currently
housed in Leslie's private files. Essentially, Eliot sees the charges
against his own poetry as a matter of geographical and generational
sensitivity. Neither the Jews he has known in England nor his older
Jewish friends in America have ever mentioned

<b></b>

evidence of anti-Semitism in his work. (The poems in which the word
<i>Jew</i> appears were all published by Jews&#8212;in England by Leonard
Woolf and in America by Alfred Knopf and Horace Liveright.) In any event,
those poems were written many years ago, before racial sensibilities
have become as polarized as they are today. Eliot then concludes on a
personal note. "Incidentally, and last," he writes, "as you say that you
are Jewish: I hope that you will not consider it an impertinence of me to
express the hope that you are diligent in attendance at your synagogue
(if you are so fortunate as to have one in Missoula, that you observe
the Law and read the Scriptures, and that you cherish the faith of your
fathers" .
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's response didn't mollify Fiedler, to say the least. According
to a witness, at a conference in 1975 held in Athens, Ohio for example,
he referred to Eliot as an "asshole," causing a number in the audience
to walk out. (Ross Posnock, personal communication to the author).

the eugenics movement in the 1920s&#8212;William McDougal, chair of
the Psychology department, was a great advocate&#8212;and its gradual
distancing from the fad: in 1927, it turned down a $60,000 bequest to
fund eugenics courses, although the principle at stake here may have
been autonomy from donor requests than changes in communal predilection.

For Eliot's connection with eugenics, see Donald Childs, <i>Modernism
and Eugenics: Woolf, Eliot, Yeats, and the Culture of Degeneration</i>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002). In my view, this connection
is considerably less problematic than his studies in Sanskrit, primitive
religion, and comparative anthropology, for these are connected, via
a number of different sources (comparative philology, the Cambridge
school of anthropology, etc.) to the discourse of Aryanism, one which
had even in its pre-Nazi instantiations a problematic relation to Jews
(or "Semites"). For a fascinating account of some of the cultural and
intellectual positioning involved, see Maurice Olender, <i>The Languages
of Paradise: Aryans and Semites, a Match Made in Heaven,</i> trans. Arthur
Goldhammer (Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1992). For an
astute reading of Eliot in the context of anthropological thought, see

Here's an example of Eliot's sense of his own rootlessness at this
time, as given to us by Michael North. It is encoded in other racially
problematic terms, but still poignantly apposite to his comments on Jews:
"Eliot wrote to Herbert Read: 'Some day, I want to write an essay about
the point of view of an American who wasn't an American, because he
was born in the South and went to school in New England as a small boy
with a nigger drawl, but who wasn't a Southerner because his people
were northerners in a border state and looked down on all southerners
and Virginians, and who so was never anything anywhere . . . " Quoted
in <i>The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century
Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 78.
<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
Matters after Eliot's conversion on this front are no better, but
for reasons of space I have not included my consideration of them
here. I would merely point out that Eliot's problem with free-thinking
Jews, evident both in his University of Virginia lecture and in his
correspondence with Jews (Schuchard quotes two of these, and the Fiedler
correspondence adds a third to the list), grows out of the same dynamic
of identification as his anti-Semitic poetry. Here, it's a racialized
identification of the intellectual with the Jew, originating in Arnold's
<i>Culture and Anarchy,</i> that he's responding to and defending himself
against. Needless the say, from a Jewish point of view, the problem in
his response, phrased in the most appalling terms in his lecture but
evident in a more benign guise in the letters to Jews, is his need to
label, identify, or define <i>for</i> Jews what their Jewishness should
consist of, to tell

<b></b>

Jews how they should act in the modern world. It's this that I mean
by a structural anti-Semitism, one which is quite compatible with
philo-Semitism and one that, indeed, often encompasses it (see Pat
Robertson for a contemporary example). It inheres in a desire to construct
symbolic meanings of Jews, which then get imparted to Jews, rather than
the willingness to let Jews, as members of modern, pluralistic societies,
make up their own mind about what their Jewishness can and should mean.

Sometime in the mid-1950s the Guyanese artist Aubrey Williams, a leading
member of Afro-modernism and black abstractionism, was introduced to
Pablo Picasso by Albert Camus during a visit to Paris. Given Williams's
association with various factions of cubism and his attempt to emulate its
style to capture the hybrid cultures of his native Guyana, the meeting
with the great artist was supposed to be a highlight of his career,
perhaps a catalyst for new directions in the troubled relation between
artists of African descent and the international avant-garde. But as it
turned out, the meeting between Williams and Picasso, far from being an
ephiphanic encounter, was to be remembered as anticlimactic:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There was nothing special about meeting Picasso. It was a meeting like
many others, except that meeting Picasso was a big disappointment. It was
a disappointment for stupid little things: I didn't like how he looked;
I didn't like how he behaved. I never thought I would not like people
like that. But the total of the whole thing is that <i>I did not like
Picasso.</i> He was just an ordinary past-middle-aged man. I remember
the first comment he made when we met. He said that I had a very fine
African head and he would like me to pose for him. I felt terrible. In
spite of the fact that I was introduced to him as an artist, he did not
think of me as another artist. He thought of me only as something he
could use for his own work.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Williams's disappointment may have arisen from a sense of heightened
expectation about the master, or even the hurt that came from not being
recognized as a fellow artist, but what stands

<b></b>

out in this description of the encounter is that what Picasso found
most enchanting about the Guyanese painter was a "fine African head,"
he valued as a model for art. Williams was disappointed that he was
appealing to Picasso merely as an object or subject of art, not as
an artist, not as a body, not even as a human subject. And yet, it is
possible that this disappointment arose because Williams had assumed,
as many historians of art have assumed over a century of modernism, that
because Picasso was the most important re in primitivism, the movement
in art when the Other, often black or brown, became a catalyst for modern
art, that he must have had some respect for the cultures and bodies that
had made modernism possible. How else could one make other cultures and
subjects the sources of art, the agents of the major breakthroughs we
have come to associate with modernism, unless one also valued the people
who produced it? We now know, of course, that the relationship between
Picasso and his African sources was much more complicated than Williams
might have assumed. Indeed, the fascination with the "fine African head"
did not simply reflect the insensitivity of an artist past middle age;
on the contrary, Picasso's relationship to Africa, or his investment in
a certain idea of Africa, which is evident from his early career to his
high cubist period, was a meticulous attempt to separate the African's
art from his or her body, to abstract, as it were, those elements of
the art form that would serve his purpose at crucial moments in his
struggle with established conventions of Western art. This is the gist
of the argument I want to present in this essay.
<p>
Much has been written on Picasso and primitivism but little on his
specific engagement with Africa. Indeed, a major part of the argument I
will be presenting here demands a separation of primitivism, as a now
canonized idea in the history of modernism, from African cultures and
bodies. Picasso loved the idea of the primitive and tribal, but his
relationship with the cultures and peoples of Africa and Oceania was
more ambiguous. We are told, by Andr&eacute; Malraux, among others, that
Picasso was irritated by "the influences that the Negroes had on me" even
as he eloquently discussed the magical influence of those African objects
discovered at the Old Trocad&eacute;ro on that fateful day in 1906.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
In most of his reflections on the "Negro" influence he seemed careful
to make distinctions between the effect or affect of African objects
and cultures. When he talked about the "Negro," he was talking about
the object rather than the person.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The fact that Picasso had an intimate relationship with African objects
is not in doubt; but there is little evidence of an interest in Africans
as human beings and producers of culture beyond his general interest
and involvement in anti-colonial and other radical movements. Indeed,
as Williams discovered in that encounter in Paris in the 1950s, Picasso
seemed to be meticulous in his separation of objects of art from bodies,
and it is my contention that it was in this division of bodies from
artistic models that the African could be cleansed of its danger and thus
be allowed into what Aaran has aptly called "the citadel of modernism."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
It is now claimed that in order for modernism to claim its monumentality,
that is its enshrinement in the very institutions of Western culture and
museum culture that it had set out to defy and deconstruct, it had to
shed the contaminants of the Other as part of what D. A. Miller calls,
in a different context, its "routine maintenance."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
In fact, the debates that have come to define modernism, the custodial
commentaries on

<b></b>

its monumentality, tend to see it as the triumph of endogamy over exogamy,
of internal forces over external ones.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
It is remarkable that except in those instances when the topic at hand
is primitivism, the canonical narrative of modernism has little to say
about African sources.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Now, this absence can be explained in one of two ways: one could argue,
for instance, that the institutions of commentary have been so eager
to secure the purity of modernism, that they have become mechanisms
of surveillance against the danger that engendered it in the first
place. Africa is first acknowledged as a significant episode in the
history of modernism, and then it is quickly dispatched to the space of
primitivism, a place where it poses no danger to the purity of modern
art. However, there is a second, even more interesting explanation,
namely that the practitioners of modernism had themselves started the
process of containment, that they needed the primitive in order to carry
out their representational revolution, but that once this task had been
accomplished, the Other needed to be evacuated from the scene of the
modern so that it could enter the institutions of high art. How else can
we explain the paradox that runs throughout the history of modernism,
the fact that almost without exception the Other is considered to be part
of the narrative of modern art yet not central enough to be considered
constitutive? To put it more specifically, why is it possible to argue
simultaneously that the discovery of African and Oceanic art enabled
the moment of modernism yet claim that these works did not have a
fundamental influence in the shaping of modernism? From Daniel-Henry
Kahnweiler's dismissal of the "Negro influence" in the rise of cubism
to Pierre Daix's famous claim that "there is no 'Negro' in the <i>Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon,</i>" one of the greatest puzzles of modern art
is whether Africa has to be considered a categorical imperative in
the theory and practice of modern artists or just a passing fad in the
ideology of modernism.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
My discussion will proceed in a circuitous way, but it will focus, from
different directions, both on Picasso's entanglement with Africa and the
critics' and art historians' entanglement with this entanglement. My
goal is to show how understanding it&#8212;the entanglement that
is&#8212;is crucial to our rethinking of the aesthetic of modernism and
the schemata&#8212;and stigmata&#8212;of difference that both maintains
and haunts it.

<p>
Let us start with a basic question: is there an Africa in Picasso's
oeuvre? And if so, what form does it take? Is it the Africa of bodies
or art forms, of material culture or abstracted ideals? At first sight
this might appear to be a banal question, especially when we recall
the countless debates surrounding the influence of Africa as the mark
of Picasso's modernist breakthrough and, inevitably, the centrality of
primitivism in his aesthetic practices. But this old question needs to
be posed because with few exceptions, the major studies of the African
influence in Picasso, whether for or against it, are explorations
of the influence of certain African art objects on Picasso's work,
or generalized explorations of how African art objects, discovered at
the Old Trocad&egrave;ro, triggered the "terror" that made modernism
possible. The terms of reference in these studies tend to acknowledge
the African influence and to dispose of it in the same

<b></b>

breath, either by confining "Africanisms" to the realm of psychological
fear or artistic structure. What these approaches seem to do, even in
their detailed and meticulous study of "Africanisms" in Picasso, is also
to minimize what I am calling the constitutive role of Africa in the
making of modernism. In 1948 Kahnweiller would, in a single bold gesture,
testify to the modernist's heavy interest in Negro Art and still proceed
to "dispute the validity of the thesis of a direct influence of African
art on Picasso and Braque."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In 1984, William Rubin would provide perhaps one of the most detailed
explorations of the influence of primitive art on Picasso's major works
and still conclude that tribal sculpture did not have a constitutive
role in the shaping of his art.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
From the moment Picasso began to be canonized as the most important
painter of the modern period in the 1940s, the institutions of
interpretation have been anxious to minimize or dismiss any direct and
determinative correlation between his works and the tribal objects that
surrounded him as he undertook the project of making art modern. Where
the influences of the tribal seem self-evident, they are redefined
as "convergences" (by Kahnweiller), "affinities" (by Rubin), or
"connotations" (by Bois).
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
My interest here is to probe the reasons for this anxiety of
influence. What threat does the acknowledgement of correlativity between
the modern and its Others pose? What is the basis of the hauntology
that has come to define the moment of modernism and Western high culture
in general?
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Elsewhere I have argued that one of the unifying characteristics of
the aesthetic ideology that has emerged in Europe since the eighteenth
century, is its concern with Others as the enabling conditions of
beauty, taste, and judgment and, simultaneously, with the counterpoints
or opposites of these conditions. If art has come to function as the
defining point of cultural achievement and civilization, it is only
because it functions within economies of desires and ideals&#8212;of
purity and a chaste culture&#8212;clearly distinct from the danger and
defilement represented by the Other and in need of defense from the
barbarism that necessitates taste.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Modernism presents an immediate challenge to this thesis because, its
overall economy, especially its adulation of primitivism, would seem to
posit the Other not as a threat that must be contained but as the source
of new energies. In 1919, T. S. Eliot declared that one could no longer
understand culture without knowing "something about the medicine-man and
his works": "As it is certain that some study of primitive man furthers
our understanding of civilized man, so it is certain that primitive
man and poetry help our understanding of civilized art and poetry."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
What is easy to miss in declarations such as this one is that the
primitive was a conduit to understanding "civilized" man, art,
and poetry, not an endpoint in itself; there was no incentive to
understand the Other unless it would lead to an understanding of Western
civilization either in its "childhood" or moments of crisis. Thus, Eliot
wanted his readers to comprehend something about the medicine-man so
that they could recognize the sensibility of the poet, "the most able
of men to learn from the savage."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Savagery and the artistic sensibility would intimately be connected
in the aesthetic of modernism; however, it did not follow that the
moderns were willing to give up civilization to become one with the
savage. Indeed, the relation between the modern and the savage was
defined by a dialectic of love and loathing, identity and difference. So
it is with Picasso and Africa.

<b></b>

Even in his "Negro" period, Picasso seemed to prefer the African art
object to the "uncultured" African body. Nevertheless, this preference
for the art object over the body was something that Picasso arrived
at in the process of working through his aesthetic ideology at certain
crucial phases of his career, beginning with his troubled relation to
academic art during his youth, his subsequent flirtation with "soft"
modernism, and culminating in the cubism that marked the revolution
in modern art. His oscillation between the African body and artwork
appears to be the symptom of a deep and continuous engagement with the
continent, the mythologies surrounding it, the fantasies it generated,
and ultimately the threat it posed to the idea of civilization that the
modernists both wanted to deconstruct and yet secure as the insignia of
white, European, cultural achievement.
<p>
Under these circumstances, it is best to begin a rethinking of Picasso
and the haunting of Africa by comparing his ration of the continent
in the years before his "Negro Period" (1906-1908) and the irruption of
modernism. It is useful to recall here that in the early years of his
career, Picasso was preoccupied with what Marilyn McCully has called
"classicizing subjects and forms"; he was primarily attracted to the
art forms of what he construed to be classical cultures, mostly Iberian
and Egyptian.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
It is important to note at the outset that he did not consider
"Negro Africa" to be part of this classical heritage or classicizing
impulse. The absence of Africa from Picasso's classicism suggests an
early awareness, on the artist's part, that the value of "Negro Africa"
as a model or source of art lay elsewhere; it could not be relegated
to antiquity nor could it be considered modern; rather it occupied a
middle space temporally located both in the childhood of mankind and
yet very much part of the living world. This understanding of Africa was
determined&#8212;and explained&#8212;by Picasso's Andalusian background
much more than his French sojourn. Indeed, as Natasha Staller has
shown, Picasso's engagement with the myth of Africa predates his 1904
move to Paris or his 1907 discovery of African art objects at the Old
Tr&oacute;cadero (<i>SOD,</i> 269-301).
<p>
My concern here, then, is the meaning of Africa in Picasso's
pre-primitivism period, especially the often forgotten fact that he was
the product of an Andalusia whose identity had historically been defined
against an African cartography, disconnected from the "dark" continent
by the Strait of Gibraltar but connected to it by history. This ambiguous
connection led to "a series of complex and ambivalent racial, religious,
and sexual stereotypes, and [to] the Malagueno myth of Africa, including
the belief that the defeat of Africa made one modern" (<i>SOD,</i>
269). Staller informs us that the defeat of the Moors entered Andalusian
consciousness as an epochal moment: "the middle ages ended on 18 August
1487"; it was understood "in terms of apocalyptic rupture&#8212;a
rupture explicitly understood in terms of modernity" (<i>SOD,</i>
271). The myth that Picasso inherited from this history was one in
which Africa was posited as the unmodern antithesis of the new Malaga:
to become modern was to break away from Africa. Modernity, rather than
classicism, defined what Picasso inherited&#8212;and resisted&#8212;as
tradition. Where does resistence fit into this narrative? Since Picasso
had to reject tradition in order to become an artist, or at least to
break away from the artistic traditions associated with his father, he
needed, paradoxically, to discover and valorize a counterpoint to the
modernity of Andalusia by inventing his own version of the unmodern. He

<b></b>

could seek this unmodern, first, in the classical tradition. But it
also seems, as scholars of his early works have noted, that a mastery
of classical models of painting, especially those concerning the human
form, would not enable a rupture in Western systems of representation;
after all, one of the uncanny moves of modernity was to embrace the
classical itself as the source of its civilizational authority.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
In this sense, it was significant that the Malagueno myth of the
modern was predicated not on a break from antiquity, but from the
Middle Ages, clearly associated with the Arabic, Moorish, and hence
African influences.
<p>
Aware, then, that the classical alone could not be valorized as the
alternative to the modern, Picasso's work in the early years turned to
the painting of the body in order to appropriate its classical form but
also to mark his difference from the inherited tradition. What stands
out in his transitional works from 1906 such as the <i>Two Nudes</i> (<A
NAME="1" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#1"> 1</a>)<b>,</b>
is what Margaret Werth has aptly described as a historical and formal
liminality.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Werth argues that the <i>Two Nudes</i> is liminal "in that it situates
itself between formal investigation and the archaic of primitive;
between materialization and dematerialization of the body; between
ration and disration; and between masculine and feminine."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
But I think this liminality is also the reflection of a deep
anxiety about tradition. On one hand, Picasso wanted to re
the body in the classical style, on the other hand, he wanted his
representation to be in excess of the conventions he had inherited;
and this excess is marked by his drawing of the human form out of
proportion and, more significantly, by his conversion of the face
to a mask. As the <i>Portrait of Gertrude Stein</i> (<a name="2"
href="10.3gikandi_res.html#2"> 2</a>), also painted in 1906,
was to illustrate, Picasso would turn to masking when he felt he had
failed to capture the human face even after numerous sittings.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
But if Picasso's goal was to break away from inherited
conventions&#8212;and the distortion of classical forms in the early works
seems to enforce this view&#8212;then there was an even more radical way
in which he could achieve the task of disration, that is, by turning
to Africa. We know, for example, that the artist inscribed his youthful
rebellion by claiming a Moorish identity. We also know that his adolescent
drawings are populated by Moorish res and subjects, representing the
danger of what I have called the "unmodern." These drawings represent
juvenile fantasies about the Moorish Other. In the late 1890s, however,
Picasso embarked on some academic paintings of the African body (<A
NAME="3" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#3"> 3</a>).
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
These paintings are important for two reasons. First, they represent
the first and only time that Picasso was interested in the corporeal
form of the African. After that, as I will show later, Picasso's
interest in things African, even during his so-called "Negro Period,"
was limited solely to art objects which came to stand in for Africa
itself. Second, in his academic paintings, Picasso perceived Africans
in a twofold relation: the African nude represented the body in its
"natural" state, one which was, nevertheless, out of proportion with the
"ideal" in long-established European notions about ways of representing
the human form in art. (These paintings reflected stereotypical notions
of the black's excessive sexuality; indeed, what made the black body, in
the form of the models Picasso was painting, compelling was its unusual
distortion.) In order to defy convention&#8212;in the <i>Two Nudes,</i>
for example&#8212;Picasso could draw the white body by drawing it out
of proportion. Now, it seemed, the black body

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 462]</b>

represented the corporal form out of order, even in nature, and hence
already in defiance of the laws of proportion and symmetry. In these early
paintings, the African's body, in its disproportional form and primitive
sexuality, would allow Picasso to kill two birds with one stone, both
classicism(which favored idealized bodies) and modern culture (which
was coy about male sexuality). Consequently, in this early phase of his
career, Picasso adopted African forms as a way of thinking through the
limitations of the forms of representation favored by the art academy,
namely a sense of order, proportionality, and idealization. The African
body formed the embodiment of disorder.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
There is, of course, great irony in this narrative of Picasso's early
relationship with the African: he was obsessed with African imageries
and bodies before he ever laid his eyes on any real Africans; while
when he first visited Paris in the year of the Universal Exhibition
of 1900 and encountered colonial Africans on display, blacks seemed, in
Staller's apt phrase, to slip off his "mental map" (<i>SOD,</i> 303). What
banished African's and Moors from Picasso's consciousness? Where did they
go? And why and how did they reappear in 1906? Behind these questions
lies the larger problem of the repressed in representation, for, to
twist the words of Fredric Jameson, it is precisely at the moment that
the object of analysis (reality, history, or even Africa) is repressed,
or its influence is denied, that "by a wondrous dialectical transfer the
historical "object" [Africa for my purposes] itself becomes inscribed
in the very form."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
But a probing of Picasso's political unconscious must be prefaced by two
additional factors. The first one is basic, namely that irrespective of
the form they would take in Picasso's work, from the phantasm in the
juvenile sketches to the abstractness of high cubism, African objects
were what he was later to call "<i>intercessors,</i>" instruments for
mediating the

<b></b>

kinds of forces, often unspoken and unlicensed, which he needed
in order to break through the edifice of modernity (<i>PM,</i>
11). Apparently, Africa was most useful to Picasso when it was confined
to the unconscious&#8212;there but not there&#8212;mediating other needs
and desires, while not serving as a primary faction in itself. From this
perspective, it would seem that when he was encountering real Africans
in Paris at the beginning of the twentieth century, they had nothing
useful to perform in his artistic project in their embodied form.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
The second factor to consider when probing Picasso's political unconscious
recalls what happened during his sojourn in G&oacute;sol in the summer
of 1906. Here I am interested not so much in what has been referred to
as Picasso's "regression to ethnic and primitive roots," or even in his
turn to female res as the intercessors of the primitive, but in his
valorization of this distortion and dissymmetry as part of his method
and signature.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
If the paintings at G&oacute;sol have one thing in common, it is
their intertextual and contrapuntal relation to previous works which
they acknowledge as part of their schema and yet displace in terms
of form and meaning. Picasso's primary goal in the "Blue Period"
(of which the stay at G&oacute;sol is exemplary) was the artistic
deformation of the European canon of painting. This goal could
best be achieved through the distortion of the white female form,
a subject or re whose ideality represented the classicism he was
ting against. This point is easily made through a comparison
of Picasso's The <i>Harem</i> and Ingres's <i>Turkish Bath</i>
(. <a name="4" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#4">4</a>
and <a name="5" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#5">5</a>)
and of his <i>Reclining Nude</i> and Goya's The <i>Naked Maja</i>
(. <a name="6" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#6">6</a> and
<a name="7" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#7">7</a>). What we
see in these repaintings of significant works in the European canon is
a reinstallation of established conventions of painting, a distillation
of formalized artistic subjects, and a transmutation of genres.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
But what does this repainting of European works have to do with
Africa? If we were to read <i>The Harem</i> in itself, as an isolated
object of reflection, or even in relation to Ingres's <i>Turkish
Bath,</i> perhaps nothing, for there is little in the painting that
points to Africa or the "Orient" as the primary referent. Treated
as autonomous objects what we have in front of us is one painting
(<i>Turkish Bath</i>) functioning as the intertext of another (<i>The
Harem)</i>. And yet from its title and implicit motif Picasso's
<i>Harem</i> does seem to echo the odalisque and this has led
commentators to read it in explicitly Orientalist terms.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Picasso encouraged this kind of reading by describing the quality of
the picture as that of "L'humanit&eacute; f&eacute;minin, la femme
d'Afrique."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Still, one wonders whether, this kind of strong Orientalist reading
is supported by the painting itself. One could argue that Picasso has
modernized the odalisque and thus distorted its terms of reference and
this may well have been his intention; nevertheless, compared to the
modernist Orientalism of, lets say Matisse, the "Eastern" referent is
weak and displaced.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
It could be said that in comparison to Matisse, Africanisms or
Orientalisms would be notable in Picasso's painting simply because
they were absent where they should have been present, or rather,
absent where we are encouraged to look for them. However, Africa was
not entirely absent from Picasso's "mental map" in the G&oacute;sol
period&#8212;it had just become confined to his artistic unconscious,
where it would re-emerge forcefully in <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>
(<a name="8" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#8"> 8</a>)
in ways that are still being contested.

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 466]</b>

<p>
African art objects are, of course, part of the thick description of
<i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> and also its enigma. According to
Malraux, Picasso was unwavering in his view that <i>Les Demoiselles
d'Avignon</i> came to him unconsciously during the visit to the Old
Trocad&eacute;ro and that it came to him not because of the enchantment
of the forms of the African art he encountered&#8212;he doesn't seem to
have paid much attention to these&#8212;but because what he recognized
in this art was a force, or spirit, that was hard to describe or
objectify. In other words, he was attracted by what he considered to
be the unconsciousness and inexpressible. The discovery of African art
was unique for Picasso because "for the first time the discovery of an
art was not the discovery of a style. African art was discovered, not
<i>an</i> African style" (<i>PM,</i> 171). In this context, the contrast
Picasso was to make between himself and Braque was revealing. For Picasso,
African objects were agents of exorcism (magical wards to be used against
the economy of symbolic form); for Braque, African art was valued because
of its form:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
That's also what separated me from Braque. He loved the Negro pieces,
but as I told you: because they were good sculptures. He was never at
all afraid of them. Exorcism didn't interest him. Because he wasn't
affected by what I called 'the whole of it,' or life, or&#8212;I don't
know&#8212;the earth?&#8212;everything that surrounds us, everything that
is not us&#8212;he didn't find all of that hostile. And imagine&#8212;not
even foreign to him! He was always at home . . . Even now . . . He
doesn't understand these things at all: he's not superstitious!
<p>
Then, there was another matter. Braque reflects when he works on his
paintings. Personally, when I want to prepare for a painting, I need
things, people. He's lucky: he never knew what curiosity was. People
stupidly mistake it for indiscretion. It's a disease. Also a passion,
because it has its advantages. He doesn't know a thing about life;
he never felt like doing everything with everything. [<i>PM,</i> 11,13]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, one of the reasons why reading Africanisms in Picasso has
continuously generated conflicts of interpretation is because many
attempts to read his "Negro Period"&#8212;and even cubist phase&#8212;as
both inside and outside European cultural history are imprisoned by
what Jameson has aptly called the ideology of modernism, which "imposes
its conceptual limitations on our aesthetic thinking and our taste and
judgment, and in its own way projects an utterly distorted model of
[literary or art] history."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
The struggle for a pure Picasso, one uncontaminated by Africa,
is ultimately a struggle to secure the aesthetic ideology of high
modernism, especially the privileging of form as the mark of its
breakthrough. It is not accidental, then, that many discussions of the
influence of African in the making of Picasso's major works tend to
revolve around the absence of a formal influence, or a style. And yet
in their concern with substantive formal influence, these discussions
start with a logic that is bound to fail because form is not what
Africa had given Picasso. Indeed, one could argue that what made the
African fetish attractive was that it would lead one away from forms
of representation modeled on observable experience or reality. After
all, as David Simpson has argued, what makes fetishism dangerous "in
all perception and representation" is that "reality itself is open
to construction."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
My contention is that it is precisely the doubleness of the
fetish&#8212;as a re that is located at the heart of culture and
ritual and yet seems to appear to us only in its perceptual nature,
against reality&#8212;that explains Picasso's enigmatic relationship

<b></b>

to the African res he discovered at the beginning of the twentieth
century. This doubleness is worth closer consideration because it haunts
some of the most influential attempts at both connecting Picasso to,
and disconnecting him from, the primitive.

<p>
In "Picasso," an essay written for the catalogue for MOMA's controversial
exhibition <i>Primitivism in 20th Century Art,</i> William Rubin
provided students of modern art with one of the most meticulous and
detailed examinations of Picasso's engagement with tribal arts and more
specifically African objects. Employing a combination of historical
documentation and a systematic comparison of some of Picasso's major
works and African art objects, Rubin establishes the centrality of the
artist's turn to primitivism and his empathy for the artworks of the
Other as one of the turning points in the emergence of modernism. He
shows, convincingly, that Picasso's turn to the primitive

<b></b>

had provided a way around artistic conventions that "had degenerated into
a rhetorical and sentimental art": "By embracing primitivism in 1906,
Picasso short-circuited the continuity of these inherited conventions,
and his year-long exploration of increasingly remote and alien aesthetic
correlatives permitted him to rediscover pictorial authenticity for
himself" ("PIC," 241). In Rubin's account, the discovery of the tribal was
an important bridge between the "soft modernism" that had characterized
Picasso's art before 1906 and the "hard modernism" of his cubist period.
<p>
But underneath his acknowledgement of the affinity between the tribal
and the modern, Rubin's project is also underwritten by a troubling
surreptitious intention: the need to minimize the role of the Other in the
emergence of modernism as a style and, in particular, the significance
of Africa as an artistic model, even when acknowledging their overall
affect. In other words, the majestic reconstructive effort in Rubin's
essay was driven by the desire to acknowledge the role of Africa as the
source of certain powerful unconscious forces while, at the same time,
minimizing the significance of the continent as the source of emulous
art forms, rather than simple spiritual objects. Thus in his reading of
Africanisms in <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,</i> Rubin sees the African
masks on the <i>demoiselles</i> as instruments for accentuating the
themes of sexuality and death rather than as models. His primary thesis
is that the invocation of African res and women (both subjects of
love and loathing in Picasso's psychic economy and behavior) enabled the
"cohabitation of Eros and Thanatos" ("PIC," 253). More specifically,
Rubin argues, the African faces would "finally conjure something that
transcends our sense of civilized experience, something ominous and
monstrous such as Conrad's Kurtz discovered in the heart of darkness"
("PIC," 254). Rubin acknowledged that Picasso's turn to the tribal was
prompted by the absence of a "Western precedent" for mask-like heads and
other forms of representing the human body in distortion, but he was
insistent that the precedence of primitivism lay not in the models it
provided but its psychological connotations; the word "African," for
example, evoked "something more fetishistic, magical, and above all,
potentially malefic" ("PIC," 259).
<p>
From this interpretation we can discern two immediate issues, which,
lie at the heart of the schemata of difference in modernism. The first
one is how the psychologizing of the relationship between the artist
and his primitive art forms depended on, or ended in, the sublimation of
the perceptual in the conceptual. Building on Picasso's own claim that
the tribal objects in his studio were "more witnesses than models,"
Rubin makes a crucial distinction between the kind of intertextuality
that characterized Picasso's relationship to the works of other European
artists such as C&eacute;zanne and tribal sculpture. In this scenario,
tribal sculpture could function as a point of departure for Picasso,
but its significance as an artistic source&#8212;a model&#8212;was
militated by the fact that Picasso "metamorphosized" his objects of
reference: "Picasso was impressed by aspects of its conceptual structure,
principles that he could abstract from their sources and use to his own
end" ("PIC," 260-2). It would appear that Rubin's goal here is to confer
the power of psychological affect on Africa while, at the same time,
denying it a formal influence in the making of modernism. But perhaps
more important is the distinction he draws between Picasso's intertextual
relation to tribal,

<b></b>

as opposed to, European art. Why is it that Picasso's intertextual
relation to Gauguin or C&eacute;zanne was considered constitutive (hence
conceptual) while his relationship to African objects was perceptual,
a mere starting point to something more profound than its degree zero?
<p>
We can clarify the issue at hand here by recalling that Picasso was one
of the most intertextual of modern artists. Indeed, the moments in his
career that have come to be considered epiphanic, such as the sojourn
to G&oacute;sol, are marked by powerful repaintings of the works of
other artists. It is in his distortion of the works of his precursors
that Picasso established his difference and thus his modernism. When
we consider Picasso's relation to, let's say Ingres or Goya during his
G&oacute;sol sojourn, Gauguin during the "Blue Period" or C&eacute;zanne
during the cubist phase, we are left in no doubt about the centrality of
intertextuality in his project. It can easily be said that his paintings
are, to borrow Jonathan Culler's words "intelligible only in terms of
a prior body of discourse&#8212;other projects and thoughts, which it
implicitly or explicitly takes up, prolongs, cites, refutes, transforms."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Nevertheless, in his study of the intertextual relation between the
European modern and the African or Oceanic primitive, Rubin's categorical
claim is that Picasso transformed the tribal masks in <i>Les Demoiselles
d'Avignon</i> so radically that nothing on the canvass resembled
"any African or Oceanic mask Picasso could have seen in Paris in
1907 in the studios of his friends or at the Trocad&egrave;ro museum"
("PIC," 262). What makes this claim puzzling, however, is that it is not
clear that a reading of Picasso's transformation of the masked res
from African or Oceanic traditions was radically different from the
transformation that the works of other European artists underwent in
his hands. Indeed, the transformation of res and forms so that they
could retain only a minimal relation to their artistic precursors was
one of the hallmarks of the method that we now call abstraction. And
as the structuralists used to argue in the 1960s and 1970s, one of the
signatures of a strong, as opposed to a weak, intertextuality was the
extent of the deviation from the original model. Strong intertextuality is
evident when the "borrowed" textual unit is "abstracted from its context
and inserted as if in a new textual syntagm as a paradigmatic element."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
A second problem in Rubin's psychological reading of Picasso's Africanism
is the emphasis he places on the subliminal and subconscious or
unconscious. It is, of course, true that in foregrounding the perceptual
dimension of the African connection, Rubin follows a long tradition (one
encouraged by Picasso himself) in which the encounter with the primitive
is defined by fear and repulsion and is hence connected to the forces that
modern civilization repressed. This is, of course, the familiar narrative
of primitivism in modernism. But to argue that the primitive art object
appealed to the modernists because of its association with repressed
psychological forces, and that those forces were the triggers for the
revolutionary works of modernism, should not necessarily lead to a de
facto negation of the more formal, conscious, conceptual influences
tribal art had on Picasso and his contemporaries. The problem with
Rubin's valorization of the psychological impact of the primitive on
Picasso's artistic consciousness is that it is built on the rather dubious
presupposition that subconscious or unconscious influences negate formal
ones; hence his expenditure of much energy trying to

<b></b>

show that the objects that were supposed to have influenced Picasso's
revision of <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>&#8212;Dan masks, for
example&#8212;were not accessible to the artist at a particular phase
in his career.
<p>
Rubin's theoretical stratagem&#8212;the claim that African art objects
had entered Picasso's subconscious but never rose to the level of
formal models&#8212;reflects, perhaps more boldly than that of others',
a significant feature of the conundrum of modernism in its relation
to the Others that it considered part of its schema. Simply put, if we
deny the Other as a model for new forms of art, how do we explain the
resemblances between Picasso and African masks that he was not supposed
to have seen? It is in response to this question that Rubin developed
his influential&#8212;and quite controversial&#8212;theory of affinities:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The resemblances between the heads in the <i>Demoiselles</i> and the
masks that have been compared to them in art-historical studies are
thus all fortuitous&#8212;reflections of affinities between arts that
communicate through conceptual signs, rather than through pictorial
conventions directly derived from seeing. Yet the fact that so many
more such affinities may be found between Picasso's art and that of
the tribal peoples than is the case with the work of other pioneer
modernists reflects, on Picasso's part, a profound identity of spirit
with the tribal peoples as well as a generalized assimilation of the
principles and character of their art. ["PIC," 265]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Rubin's argument depends on a fundamental distinction between
influence and affinity. In influence (Ingres, Gauguin, or C&eacute;zanne
on Picasso, for example) the relationship between the work of art and
its model takes place on the conceptual level in terms of observed formal
conventions. In affinity, the influence is perceptual, almost unconscious,
functioning on "an invented projection of an internal, psychological
state" (ibid). Rubin would simply not allow for "tribal" influences on
the formal, artistic level so central to the identity of modernism. It
was only through the unconscious that the Other would be allowed into a
now canonized modernism. An unconscious influence would not be allowed
to enter the surface where form is discernible. Thus, to describe or
posit an influence as unconscious is to simultaneously acknowledge its
constitutive presence in the making of the object under discussion but
also to deny it visibility. Apprehended in its absence and read solely
in terms of its perceptual, sensual influence, the African Other would
be contained and then evacuated from the edifice of high modernism.
<p>
But what are we to do with those instances where Picasso visibly modeled
his works on African objects and where the relationship between the two
was quite formal, as in the case of the <i>Guitar</i> and a Grebo mask
(. <a name="9" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#9">9</a> and
<a name="0" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#0">10</a>)? Rubin
documents many instances of what appear to be conceptual African
influences in Picasso's work, especially in 1907 and 1908, including
<i>Woman's Head</i> and a Fang sculpture (. <a name="1"
HREF="10.3gikandi_res.html#1">11</a> and <a name="2"
HREF="10.3gikandi_res.html#2">12</a>), but not even his own
evidence was enough to convince him that these works constituted
real models, sources of formal borrowings, rather than launching pads
towards a cubism detached from its influences. Clearly, Rubin was not
willing to concede African art forms the distinctive status of art;
they remained&#8212;had to remain&#8212;artifacts (ritual objects)
with the capacity for psychological influence, but not sources

<b></b>

of a formalized aesthetic. And in a curious way, this confinement of
African works of art to artifacts or ritual objects seems to ignore the
fact that in his own relationship with African objects, Picasso tended
to prefer those works which seemed to fit his <i>aesthetic</i> interests
and sensibilities rather than simple affect. Indeed, if Picasso seemed
to value African art objects over bodies, and quite often to privilege
the former over the latter, as I argued at the beginning of this essay,
it was because he was, in a very strict aesthetic sense, self-conscious
and selective about the objects he found worthy of incorporation in his
art. In short, Picasso had a clear idea about which objects, among his
vast African collection, could be considered worthy of formal emulation
and which could be consigned to the spectatorship of ritual.
<p>
It is now common to argue that Picasso was attracted to African art
because of its capacity to generate terror or that he sought those
subjects who would serve as what Bois calls "models for anatomical forms."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
And yet the Africanist elements in Picasso's paintings only appear
deforming to the extent that they call previous conventions of painting
into question, not merely because they duplicate the syphilitics that he
had encountered in French hospitals. In this sense it is striking that
while he had in front of him some of the most deformed and terrifying
res in the African pantheon, real fetishes as it were, Picasso
chose as models those masks that seemed to be closer to a familiar
European grammar about form and symmetry even when they challenged some
established notions of representation. Consequently, Picasso's version of
tribal art is one cleansed of the terror he seemed to have experienced
in his first encounter with it, streamlined in such a way that they are
no longer images of the deformity we are eager to ascribe to African
ritual objects. Once we recognize that Picasso modeled some of his works
on African objects but also departed from them significantly, once we
reject the model or no model option, we can shift the significance of
his relationship with Others elsewhere.

<p>
Now, one of the major criticisms leveled against the notion of affinity,
the reigning paradigm in the study of modernism and primitivism,
has centered on the implication that the tribal and the modern were
bound together by what James Clifford called "a deeper or more natural
relationship than mere resemblance or juxtaposition."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Clifford's major difficulty with affinity as "an allegory of kinship" is
that in its universalizing claims it excludes the stories and experiences
of the Others that modernism seeks to re-appropriate in its own image,
that scholars of modernism are primarily interested in tribal art for
its "informing principles" or its "elemental expressive modes."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
True enough. But it is important to underline the point that if
the proponents of affinity seem to have no difficulties mounting an
exhibition built on allegories of kinship, it is precisely because the
aesthetic ideology of modernism was itself driven by the same impulse,
the desire to encounter the Other in its ugliness and terror and then
purify it so that it could enter the modern art world as part of its
symmetrical economy. The major difference between modern artists and
their posthumous patrons is simply that the former were also interested
in "conceptual displacement" while the latter were

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 474]</b>

invested solely in "morphological coincidence."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
What makes Picasso such a central re in the history of modernism's
relationship to its Others was his ability to make the primitive central
to the aesthetic ideology of modern art while also transforming tribal
art objects in such a way that they were no longer recognizable as
models. This is how <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> has come to
be read, in Hal Forster's majestic phrase, as both the primal scene
of primitivism&#8212;" one in which its structure of narcissism and
aggressivity is revealed"&#8212;and also the site of disavowal of the
very difference it considers a condition of possibility.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
So, where exactly is Africa in Picasso's schemata? This question
returns us to the problem that opened my discussion, namely the strict
separation of African peoples and art objects in the artist's notion of
the primitive. However, a set of more complicated questions needs to be
posed: how could Picasso turn to Africa for its magic and art and yet
avoid being entangled in its endangered cultures or the problems of its
colonized peoples? How do we reconcile the terror and danger he felt when
he first encountered African objects at the ethnographic museum with the
symmetrical relationship he established between the tribal art work and
abstract modernism so that the two seem almost to have been made for one
another? The complaint that curators of modernism and primitivism seem
to avoid tribal artworks that seem impure and asymmetrical in relation to
the structures of Picasso's art is a familiar one, but I have been arguing
that the failure of such curatorial endeavors as the 1984 MOMA exhibition
does not simply arise from a yearning to rescue modern works from the
aesthetic influence of the primitive, or even from the institutional
necessity to wink at, yet displace, tribal works from their context. A
larger problem concerns the imprisonment of curators and historians
in the logic of coherence and symmetry favored by the practitioners of
modern art. In the end, this logic ignores two major problems which need
to be at the center of any discussion of the relationship between modern
painters and their African sources, especially when we are discussing
those crucial years between 1895 and 1922 when modernism emerged: the
question of African definition and authority of sources.
<p>
The question of definition was raised most poignantly by Robert Farris
Thompson in 1988: "what are the indigenous <i>African</i> definitions of
the impact of African art forms on the artists of the cities of Europe
(like Fang masks in Paris) at the beginning of this century?"
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Berating the arrogance of Western art historians who never once consider
that "the African priests and traditional leaders might have something of
intellectual substance to contribute to this most important argument,"
Thompson concludes that "the final definition of the impact of African
and Oceania upon modern art remains incomplete until we take large
photographs of the Africanizing works of Picasso, Braque, <i>et al</i>
to traditional Africa . . . and listen to indigenous comments and
critical reaction."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
We still do not have "indigenous" commentaries on works of modernism. In
the few instances where indigenous artists have been given access to
the institutions of commentary, they have been denied the authority
of criticism.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Even the works of African art historians produced in the most prestigious
institutions in the West, are not heard across the temporal and
cartographic divide that separates the study of expressive and other
cultural forms between the modern and everything before or after it.

<b></b>

<p>
But what lessons could we learn from African art historians that would
be useful to modernism, to the relation between Picasso and Africa? For
one, we could learn that Picasso has had a significant, though perhaps
surreptitious, influence on the field of African art studies. Otherwise
how can one explain the almost unquestioning assumption that the mask is
the primary medium of traditional African visual expression? On the other
side of the debate, however, a shift in contexts of reading&#8212;from
seeing Africa from Picasso's perspective to seeing the modern artist's
from the Other's angle of vision &#8212;can yield even more useful
results. Consider the fact that in a large measure, the literature on
Picasso and his African sources assumes that the mask in Africa was
part of a unified and intelligible tradition and that its value lay
in its ritualized form and function. Yet, the most detailed studies of
African masks, their cultural contexts, and the views of their producers,
recognize the intersection between the ritual fields in which they are
produced (and out of which they perhaps cannot be understood) and the
centrality of the meaning of the mask in motion.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Indeed, contemporary African writers and artists who have deployed the
mask in their works recognize the significance of movement in determining
the form of the mask and its interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
A final enigma must be confronted if we are to rethink the role of the
Other in the making of modern art outside the ideology of modernism: how
do we transcend the established doxa that it was through the acquisition
of the "mythical method" or "mystical mentality" inherent in primitivism
that, to paraphrase T. S. Eliot, art was made possible for the modern
world?
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
What is the source of this idea, the unquestioned notion that the art of
the primitive emerged from a mystical, preconscious mentality and found
its ideal form in myth? Why, indeed, did the idea of the African fetish
dominate Picasso's understanding of the African primitive in that initial
encounter at the Trocad&eacute;ro in 1906? We are, of course, familiar
with the ethnographers of the primitive mentality and the mythical
method, most notably Levi-Bruhl and Sir William Fraser, and countless
studies have been devoted to the influence of their ethnography on the
ideology of modernism; but we have not often paid enough attention to
the ethnographers' sources. As a matter of fact, we seem to take it
for granted that the ethnographers of modernism conducted field work
among the primitives and that their powerful ideas on the cultures and
myths of the other came from native sources. The real story, however, is
different. The primary sources behind the idea of the African primitive
were not the academic ethnographers but a group of what I will call
the surrogate native informants: European adventurers such as Leo
Frobenius, Emily Torday, and Mary Kingsley; missionary ethnographers
such as Robert Nassau, John Roscoe, and G. T. Basden; and colonial
administrative officers such as R. S. Rattray in Ashanti and Amaury
Talbot in South Eastern Nigeria. These were the first Europeans to
write about African cultures and to make art central to understanding
the primitive mentality. They also produced their most important work
in the foundational years of modernism.
<p>
Briefly, there are three reasons why these surrogate informants
are central to any rethinking of modernism and its ideas of the
primitive. First, while academic ethnographers were generally critical of
the colonial enterprise, most often its methods rather than objectives,
the surrogate informants conceived their work in the field as crucial to

<b></b>

colonial governmentality and as a practical contribution to the
theoretical work of the intellectuals of modernism. They assumed that the
work of ethnographers at major European universities needed the authority
of observations made first hand in the theater of colonialism. Indeed,
surrogate informants cultivated close relations with the leading
ethnographers of primitive cultures. Thus, John Roscoe, who wrote the
first ethnography of the Baganda, was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Fraser
at Cambridge, and Rattray who wrote on the Ashanti, was a collaborator
of E. G. Selignman at Oxford. As agents in the field of colonialism,
the informants premised their authority on their contact with those
Africans who, in Roscoe's words, were "uninfluenced by foreign ideas."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Second, the surrogate informants were the first, in those crucial years
between 1905 and 1922, to promulgate the notion that the mentality of the
primitive was mystical and mythical, outside modern forms of rationality,
and under the hold of fetishism. One could not understand the native
mind or indeed any aspect of native religion and social organization
without understanding the role of the fetish, the explanatory code that
connected everything. Third, as is evident from the sheer amount of
cross-reference, the surrogate informants existed in a cohesive field
of discourse, and thus reinforced the idea of a core set of beliefs
that were uniform across Africa.
<p>
As part of a generational project, adventurers, colonial officers, and
missionaries referred to each others' work and used the parallels they
saw in their respective fields of operation to reinforce the power of
their ideas, to provide the thick description that made their evidence
unassailable. This is why even when artists such as Picasso questioned
colonial practices, they seemed to reproduce the colonialist model
of African societies; they questioned the practice but not the theory
of colonialism. This structure&#8212;the questioning of the practice
and the acceptance of the theory&#8212;tends to be reproduced when we
don't interrogate the idea of Africa in modern art, when, for example,
we forget the brutality that accompanied the arrival of the African art
object to the West, the amount of African bodies that had to be destroyed
so that the objects would arrive safely at the art museum
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Finally, three challenges remain to be addressed in greater detail. The
first one is how to restore the intimate relationship between the
brutality of late colonialism and the emergence of the ideology of
modernism and, the second, to consider more closely the role the surrogate
informants played in making Africa accessible to modernism. The third
one is how to displace Picasso&#8212;as the representative custodian of
high modernism in art&#8212;from the ritualized place that he occupies
in the modern museum.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
It is my contention that we cannot undertake the work
of displacement and de-ritualization without changing the
language of commentary, the allegory of affinity, the contexts
for reading and&#8212;eventually&#8212;our understanding of
perspective and spectatorship. What were to happen, for example,
if one were to exhibit <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> next to
Faith Ringgold's quilt, <i>Picasso's Studio</i> (<a name="3"
href="10.3gikandi_res.html#3"> 13</a>), instead of
traditional Pende Mbuya masks? Or if we examined <i>Woman's Head</i> not
in relation to an indigenous Fang mask but next to <i>Mina ya Nnom</i>
(<a name="4" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#4"> 14</a>),
a bronze sculpture by Leandro Mbomio Nsue, the contemporary Equatorial
Guinean artist, a modern representation of the Fang perspective on form?

After eighty sittings, Picasso gave up "seeing" Gertrude Stein and turned
to the mask as an alternative way of viewing. The significance of this
turn from the human model to the mask is discussed by Michael North in

Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 59-76. For a

This is not to deny Picasso's interested radical anti-colonial politics;

The most notorious instance of this exclusion concerns the Baule artist,
Lela Kouakou, who was invited to participate in a forum on African art
but was allowed to comment only on works from his ethnic region because

that is, those not bound by his "traditional criteria." See Susan Vogel,

<p>
Like such contemporaries as John Ashbery and Barbara Guest, Denise
Levertov expressed "an affinity with visual art," claiming that "looking
at art" was a true and lasting love.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Remembering key moments in her artistic development, she mentions her
early adolescence in London where, motivated by weekly drawing lessons
with a British landscape painter, she frequented the Victoria and Albert
Museum and the National Gallery and became acquainted with the landscapes
of C&eacute;zanne, for which she had a lifelong passion (<i>T,</i>
106). As a novice she was mentored by the art critic and poet, Herbert
Read, to whom she dedicated her first book, <i>The Double Image,</i>
and among her unpublished juvenilia are many autobiographical drawings,
full of humor and wit, which show the encouragement of her mother, who
was herself an amateur artist. In fact, so strong was this affinity that,
as a young girl, she dreamed of being both an artist and a poet&#8212;as
well as a ballerina.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Thus, it is not surprising that, when she settled in New York City
after World War II, her friends included artists associated with
the Jane St. Gallery, such as Nell Blaine, in whose sketching group
she participated, as well as Albert Kresch, Leland Bell, Louisa
Matthiasdotter, and, a little later, Howard Fussiner.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
From the beginning, she turned in her poetry to the materiality of the
visual arts to express spiritual energy and force. As she put it in an
early poem, addressing artists in both media:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Incise, invent, file to poignance;
<br />
make your elusive dream

<b></b>

<br />
seal itself
<br />
in the resistant mass of crude substance.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet, the ekphrastic impulse, the desire to write poems about specific
paintings, did not become strong until <i>A Door in the Hive</i>
, after her spiritual quest had resulted in a turn toward
Roman Catholicism in the early 1980s, inspired in part by the active
opposition of radical clergy members to oppressive political regimes
in Latin America. In this book, Levertov continued the work of social
protest and spiritual contemplation evident in earlier poems written in
response to the atrocities of World War II and the Vietnam War. In fact,
the longest poem in this book, "El Salvador: Requiem and Invocation,"
combines these two impulses. It is the libretto for an oratorio about
the martyrdom of Archbishop Oscar Romero and three nuns. Their sympathy
with the struggles of the native poor led to their murder by right
wing death squads aided by the American government in what could be
construed as a continuation of earlier American foreign policy which
Levertov opposed. In this book she included four poems about works of
art and/or visual artists in the context of a perceived analogy between
"the journey of art and the journey of faith."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
Levertov's poems about works of art occur also in the context of her
ongoing concern about how political resistance is to be expressed
in lyric poetry. As Alicia Ostriker has written, distinguishing "the
poetics of postmodern witness" from confessional poetry, some poets
after World War II have reacted to Theodore Adorno's famous declaration
that there can be no poetry after Auschwitz with renewed determination
to continue the struggle with the self that is also the struggle with
what Auschwitz stands for&#8212;"not only the Holocaust but also the
ongoing concatenation of horrors scarring twentieth-century history."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
They have done so, as Ostriker puts it, "by avoiding a poetics
<i>purely</i> of the self," on one hand, and by refusing to abandon the
lyric "I," on the other, lest they deny a consciousness "that desires,
suffers and chooses," and thus provides an ethical and political model
for the reader.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Ostriker does not include Levertov's ekphrastic poems in her discussion,
choosing instead long poems by contemporary poets who employ the
fragmented structures and polyglot allusions associated with Eliot,
Pound, and Williams while regaining the autobiographical "I" rejected by
these exemplars of high modernism. Although Levertov solves the formal
problem in a different way in her ekphrastic poems, the main issue she
struggles with is the same: how to mirror and transcend the confusion
and angst of a person caught in a world of catastrophe. Thus, Ostriker's
designation, "the poetics of postmodern witness," is applicable.
<p>
This essay will focus upon Levertov's poems about works by five visual
artists, Anselm Kiefer, Chaim Soutine, Jean Duvet, Eduardo Chillida, and
Emmanuel de Witte, the contemplation of which helped her to bridge the
gulf between a despairing political awareness and an "imagined destination
of faith" (<i>NSE,</i> 257). I will explore the ways in which Levertov
employs ekphrastic poetry, the genre in which "texts encounter their
own semiotic 'others,'" to negotiate the ground between self, world,
and divinity that is <i>her</i> version of postmodern witness.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
By turning to these "others"&#8212;works by visual

<b></b>

artists with whom she feels allied&#8212;Levertov avoids indulgence in
private malaise and indirectly expresses concerns about the limits of
poetic language, her own medium. When we read these poems in sequence we
find that her initial focus on the relative poverty of words (a coded
medium) contrasted with the more direct power of visual experience
shifts to a focus upon perspective, an attribute of both arts. This
shift ultimately yields a poem, "The Composition," based on de Witte's
"Woman at the Harpsichord," a painting from a golden age in Western
culture, in which Levertov celebrates de Witte's ability to embody a
timeless ideal of peace even as she laments the distance between then
and now. In this poem Levertov expresses "ekphrastic hope," in that the
estrangement of the image/text division is overcome by the evocation of a
"a 'still moment' of plastic presence through language."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Yet her awareness that such an evocation is metaphoric, momentary,
and burdened by the tragic weight of history, infuses this poem, and
indeed the whole sequence of poems about paintings, with existential
and religious pathos. Also, in these poems, Levertov serves as an
intermediary between works of art and her audience of listening or
reading others by converting fixed scenes into poetic dramas that we
"see" in the mind's eye and thus experience vicariously.
<p>
We find Levertov's growing desire for a focus that is not merely
confessional in the prefatory note to her 1978 volume, <i>Life in the
Forest,</i> where she introduces a group of poems inspired by Cesare
Pavese, with the following words:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Pavese's beautiful poems are about various persons other than himself;
though he is a presence in them also, their focus is not autobiographical
and egocentric, and in his accompanying essays he speaks of the concept
of suggesting narrative through the depiction of a scene, a landscape,
rather than through direct recounting of events as such. The poems I
had been moving towards were impelled by two forces: first, a recurring
need&#8212;dealt with earlier by resort to a diarylike form, a poem long
enough to include prose passages and discrete lyrics&#8212;to vary a
habitual lyric mode; not to abandon it, by any means, but from time to
time to explore more expansive means; and second, the decision to try to
avoid overuse of the autobiographical, the dominant first-person singular
of so much American poetry&#8212;good and bad&#8212;of recent years.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Levertov's turn to ekphrasis was another instance of this impulse. It
was also a means of distancing herself from the threatening historical
reality of London before and during World War II. The art museum has
been called "the shrine where all poets worship in a secular age"
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
and in the poem, "Winter Afternoons in the V. and A., pre-W.W.II,"
Levertov remembers seeking a respite from the unceasing rain in the
"darkening afternoon streets" within the "lofty and vast halls" of the
Victoria and Albert Museum.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
She writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Here was history
<p>
as I desired it: magical, specific,<br />
jumbled, unstinting,

<b></b>

<p>
a world for the mind to sift
<br />
in its hourglass&#8212;now, while I was twelve,
<br />
or forever.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<div align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
[<i>CIB,</i> 48]
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
In that poem the shoes of the girl in the museum "made no sound," and
Levertov chooses a mysterious relationship between speech and silence
as the theme of the first poem in <i>A Door in the Hive,</i> the book in
which a cluster of her poems about paintings appear. It is an invocation,
"To Rilke," in which she recalls a dream in which the poet stands at
the prow of a boat in a state of receptivity, "all voice, though silent."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
He is about to take the passengers on a "needful journey" (<i>DIH,</i>
3). That this need is for an experience of divinity is evident in the
last poem in the collection, a variation on a poem in <i>The Book of
Hours,</i> also inspired by Rilke, in which he distills his quest for
an unmediated and intimate encounter with the heart of the universe.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
In Levertov's variation of Rilke's poem, the speaker wishes to be part of
"the vast mosaic&#8212;temple, eidolon," to be "imbedded in its fabric, /
as if, once, it was from that we were broken off" (<i>DIH,</i> 107). In
a different form, her ekphrastic poems also express this desire for a
religious encounter unmediated by words.
<p>
<i>A Door in the Hive</i> is divided into six sections. In her notes on
its organization, Levertov conceives its emotional curve as beginning in
artistic quest and modulating into life journey and religious quest. She
places in the second section poems about "world pain" from a variety
of perspectives.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
This is where the oratorio about El Salvador appears and her first
ekphrastic poem, "The Book Without Words," inspired by a painting by
Anselm Kiefer, follows immediately after it. Levertov described her
admiration for Kiefer's work in a letter to James Laughlin written after
she saw a Kiefer show in New York: "Kiefer is very impressive&#8212;the
link with Paul Celan is more than superficial, I feel. . . . the images
he creates are powerful and convey something about the 20<sup>th</sup>
century as no other <i>visual</i> art has done."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
She refers here both to Kiefer's <i>Margarethe and Sulamith</i>
paintings, which draw on the poetic evocation of the Holocaust and the
death camps in Celan's poem, "Fugue of Death," and to Kiefer's view of
the dilemma of the artist in the twentieth century in such paintings as
"The Book" (1979-85)," the source of her own poem. For if, as I mentioned
earlier, Adorno's proscription left artists with an aesthetic ethics of
visual absence and poetic silence, Kiefer's work explicitly thematizes
that dilemma. Born in Germany in 1945, Kiefer is not only driven by
explorations of a specifically German identity in the postwar world,
but also by the question of what it means to create in the aftermath
of fascism and genocide. In Kiefer's work "the very act of creating,
and the very fact of being an artist, is always bound up with, or
founded in, its place in the present, a present shaped by the legacy
of historical trauma."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Levertov was clearly interested in the critique of European culture
that Kiefer's painting depicts, and she was probably also drawn to his
reinvention of traditional forms, particularly landscape and history
painting. As Simon Schama points out, "What he did was to collapse the one
into the other, exactly reversing abstraction's metaphysical obligations
to push the implications of painting beyond and through the painting."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<b></b>

Kiefer rejected the "uncoupling of painterly process and its ostensible
objects" characteristic of some forms of abstraction with their implied
insistence that "the only interesting subject left for art was art"
(<i>LM,</i> 124). Where "Abstraction prized lightness, flatness, the
airy, and the cerebral. . . . Kiefer turned back to German expressionism,
for the raw texture, the gritty materiality, of historical truth"
(<i>LM,</i> 126). His paintings returned compositional lines back to
their narrative function. This formal position is analogous to Levertov's
rejection of the captious wit of language poetry, notwithstanding
the related political goals of its advocates. Certainly, in her poem,
"The Book Without Words," she responds to Kiefer's compression of form
and narrative, subtly employing point of view to interpret his use
of perspective.
<p>
When we first look at this painting, we are immediately struck by the
weight of the forged lead book in the center of the foreground (<A
NAME="1" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#1"> 1</a>). We
tend <i>then</i> to see details of the destroyed landscape around it,
composed of acrylic, emulsion, and shellac on canvas. In the body of
her poem Levertov reverses the order of this visual experience and
thereby intensifies the relationship between re and ground. She
begins by placing herself inside the painting&#8212;on the horizontal
line near the top&#8212;the "verge" of a "limitless ocean" (<i>DIH,</i>
40). The threatening "gray waves gnash / their teeth of foam" directly
in front of her (<i>DIH,</i> 40). Behind her is "the barren plain, /
seamed, fissured," composed not of earth but of "cinders" (<i>DIH,</i>
40). From this foreclosed position, the "dark and darkening" sky appears
to "bear down," and the nature of the future is uncertain at best. Instead
of offering "the ultimate direction" for a sea-voyage, the huge wordless
book "levitates, close to the hiss of spume, / / immutable, desolate"
(<i>DIH,</i> 40). It has no place on the burned ground. In her view it
is a symbol of empty, failed civilization

<b></b>

and/or of traumatized historical memory: no matter how they are
manipulated its contents are "unresonant" . . . "void upon void"
(<i>DIH,</i> 40). Levertov also employs stanza length and enjambment
to reinforce her interpretation of Kiefer's painting and to bring its
meaning home to us emphatically at the end. Reading the poem is a little
like riding the waves: the units of sound gradually increase until we come
to the last two lines, abrupt full stops: "You have come to the shore. /
There are no directions" (<i>DIH,</i> 40). As if to distinguish human
potential from the shame of the historical record, Levertov placed at the
end of this section, "On the Mystery of the Incarnation," a contrasting
poem about the word of God incorporated in the life of Christ.
<p>
If Kiefer records historical trauma and collective guilt in this painting
and in others in which he takes as his subject, "Germany's now absent
other, the Jew" (<i>AK,</i> 3), the same could be said of the paintings of
Chaim Soutine, the subject of the second ekphrastic poem in Levertov's
book. Except here her subject <i>is</i> that Other. For Soutine's
Jewishness has always been central to the interpretation of his work.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
This Lithuanian-born, shtetl-bred artist was one of the group, including
Chagall, who settled in Paris at the beginning of the twentieth
century, in flight from the menace of ill-treatment and racial hatred
that promised to grow worse. During World War II, like many Jews in
occupied France, he hid until he could hide no longer. Severely ill
with what may have been a perforated ulcer, he made his way from his
hiding place in the French countryside to a Paris hospital, where he
died in 1943. In the aftermath of the war, his life and art came to be
seen as a reflection and portent of the tragic events of contemporary
history. He became known for his ability to depict the pathos of everyday
life, its suffering and anguish, and for the intensity of his religious
longing. Levertov's poem reflects both of these interpretations. Titled
"Soutine (Two Paintings)," it is a verbal composite of two works,
"Still Life With Herrings"  and "Red Stairway at Cagnes" (1923-34)
which, in Levertov's view, epitomize the artist's interior drama
(. <a name="2" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#2">2</a>
and <a name="3" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#3">3</a>).
<p>
The essence of that drama, for Levertov, is an implied link between the
abject and the sacred. Moving back and forth, in the first stanza, between
Soutine's boldly expressive images of hunger, loss, desperation, and
unbridled desire in each painting, she dramatizes their connection. With
the repeated conditional phrase, "As if," she conveys the dream-like
way in which the "desperate things" in both paintings&#8212;the "forks"
and "red steps"&#8212;are sublimations of Soutine's feelings of being
rejected and outcast (<i>DIH,</i> 54). "Avid," "famished," "clutching,"
they nevertheless resist the restraints and negation imposed on his
subjectivity by the increasingly hostile outside world, represented here
by desiccated mythic symbols of life and love&#8212;"dead scrawny fish,"
"dead-white plate," and "abandoned cup" (ibid). In two apostrophes, "O
desperate things," and "O grey void," Levertov acknowledges Soutine's
increasingly noxious situation in a world devoid of humane or even
human content (ibid). The second stanza focuses on the second painting
alone. Here Levertov underscores Soutine's desire to take possession
of even this intolerable landscape: the skepticism of the leaning,
"wavering" houses, expressed in a rhetorical question, "and what could
there be / up there / to fulfil desire?" does not undercut nor deter
the fervent urgency of his visionary climb (ibid). His gesture is that
of an inspired mystic. In her notes on the book's organization,

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 526]</b>

Levertov explicitly recognizes the religiosity of Soutine's art. She
places "Soutine (Two Paintings)" in a third section of poems that is
"overtly religious," commenting that it reintroduces the theme of artistic
quest in that context ("NOT").
<p>
Raymond Cogniat has compared Soutine's visionary message to a reading
of the Apocalypse of St. John, "in that it makes us feel that we are
experiencing an agonizing obsession with and affirmation of catastrophe
couched in the form not of a probable future but of a visible, present
reality."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
He writes that Soutine's paintings have "the brilliance and intensity of
medieval stained glass windows" (<i>S,</i> 68). In fact, Levertov also
may have felt this connection: the next ekphrastic poem in this book,
"A Woodcut," was inspired by an engraving in the <i>Apocalypse</i>
series by Jean Duvet, whose works provide "an artistic odyssey through
the worlds of late Gothic, Renaissance and Mannerist styles."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Born in Dijon in 1485, the same year as Luther, whose faith he
was to follow, Duvet lived in a period when there was considerable
French resentment toward Rome despite major attempts to consolidate
the Counter-Reformation forces. To avoid religious persecution, he
moved first to Geneva and, in his final years, to Lyon, a center of
French Protestantism and the graphic arts, noted for its erudition and
liberal thought (<i>MU,</i> 25). Here, at age 77, Duvet produced the
<i>Apocalypse</i> plates, his last and major work. Its chief source was
the D&uuml;rer woodcut "Apocalypse" of 1498. A man of many skills and
interests, including theology and probably alchemy, Duvet established his
own way of faith and his final images are "illuminated by a . . . sense
of the isolation of man before God" (<i>MU,</i> 25). Saint John, Duvet's
patron saint as well as the patron saint of printers, was viewed as
one of the first alchemists because of apocryphal accounts of his
transforming the pebbles on the riverbank to gold. Some art historians
see the concept of the Christian alchemist as an aspect of Duvet's
experience of the "Apocalypse" entirely in keeping with the intensely
personal nature of his art (<i>MU,</i> 43). Levertov's poem, based on the
engraving titled "The Angel Shows John the New Jerusalem," reflects this
independent, personal aspect of Duvet's vision; she condenses the first
part of the story depicted by the engraving and focuses on the second.
<p>
Duvet's composition is divided into two chief areas: the upper, curved
section is occupied by the heavenly Jerusalem, while the lower part
shows the haloed Saint John on the island of Patmos (<a name="4"
HREF="10.3hollenberg_res.html#4"> 4</a>). His annunciation
takes place within a rustic structure of apple trees, especially suited
for the theophany. While in ecstatic slumber there, he is approached by an
angel who tells him that he will take him to see the New Jerusalem. The
angel's staff points upward toward the holy city. His elevation to a
mountain top, from which he sees the heavenly Jerusalem, is shown at the
upper left where he kneels at the foot of the pointing angel. The handsome
city, inspired by architectural prints of the Renaissance, is before him
with its many angel-filled portals and throngs of saved souls who gaze
up at the miniscule re of the Lord at the top left of the plate. In
front of the central gate, an angel with a rod is measuring the city, and
Saint John reappears first on the right walking in the clouds, recording
the angel's measurements in a book. The seashore at the extreme right
may represent the sea and earth which will vanish from the Evangelist's
vision during his spiritual elevation. The chain of clouds crossing the
plate reinforces the barrier between new and old (<i>MU,</i> 290).

<b></b>

<p>
In the first stanza of her poem, Levertov places us almost directly into
the upper half of this engraving. She describes John walking through
the clouds "above the earthly orchards" (<i>DIH,</i> 67), writing as he
walks. The "river's moored boats and conversing swans," which John has
passed, warrant only her cursory attention (ibid). Instead of dwelling
on John's annunciation on Patmos, in the lower half of the plate, she
describes the scene at "burnished Jerusalem" in more detail, noting the
"upward-gazing" throng of the blessed, some of whom even lean their
arms on a balustrade "to dreamily scan implicit horizons / level with
their celestial vantage point" (ibid). This focus on the adoration of the
blessed presages Levertov's interest in John's ecstatic state of mind and
its effect on his behavior. In the second stanza, she embellishes Duvet's
vision, imagining John dizzy with a blissful confusion that appears to
increase his range: he looks every which way&#8212;"upward, outward, /
back at the angel (now behind him), downward, inward&#8212;" (ibid). Most
interesting, his spiritual elevation has caused him to dispense with his
old means of record-keeping: though his ink-bottle appears at his hip,
his notebook has either "vanished" or been "discarded (ibid)."
<p>
This poem appears in the fourth section of <i>A Door in the Hive</i> along
with another ekphrastic poem, also about dramatic shifts in perspective,
titled "The Sculptor (Homage

<b></b>

to Chillida)," about the work of the contemporary Spanish sculptor. Here
Levertov is inspired by this artist's entire <i>oeuvre</i> as well by
the particularity of sculpture itself. For "Heraclitus's maxim that
conflict is the father of all things applies to sculpture more than to
any other branch of the arts. The sculptor is in conflict with space,
which he usurps and appropriates to his own ends, and with matter,
from which the nascent form must struggle free."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Levertov may also have felt a bond with Chillida's hybrid spiritual
heritage, since she considered herself both Jewish-Christian and
Anglo-American. Born in 1924 in San Sebastin, the capital of a province
in the Basque country, a region divided between France and Spain,
Chillida claims origins that are legendary, even mythological. "He
is very close to nature, in which he worships occult forces and
the power of the elements," and he has a special feeling for metal,
"allegedly introduced into the southern valleys of the Pyranees by
the first blacksmith, Tubal Cain . . . 3000 years before our era"
(<i>C,</i> 6). His sculptures "have a very close affinity with their
material and acquire from it not only their plastic qualities, but also
their symbolic and elemental character." Iron takes on the form of the
unknown, "becoming the tuning-fork of unseen vibrations and the 'comb
of winds'" in one sculpture (ibid). Chillida also speaks eloquently
about his goals as a sculptor. On the wall of his studio is the saying,
"'A cloud of birds in the sky is better than a single one in the hand,'"
which he considers a challenge to achieve the impossible, something
which lies beyond the form (<i>C,</i> 7). He says he is interested in
the space created by the shapes, "'which dwells in them and is all the
more effective when it works in secret. I might perhaps compare it to
the life-giving breath which causes the form to swell up and contract and
makes visible that inner psychic space which is hidden from the outside
world'" (ibid). He compares sculpture with music: "'Sculpture and music
exist in the same harmonious and ever developing space. The volume of
musical sound fills the silence with tension; similarly there could be
no volume in sculpture without the emptiness of space'" (<i>C,</i> 8).
<p>
Chillida's comments about the relationship between sculptured form and
"inner psychic space" is analogous to Levertov's reflections about the
relationship between speech and silence in her ekphrastic poems. In her
tribute to Chillida, she begins with the psychological feat he performs
in his work, which she gives a Jungian twist by using the word "shadow"
in the first two lines: "A man who lives with his shadow / on equal
terms"(<i>DIH,</i> 69).
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Jung used the term "shadow" to refer to that part of the collective
unconscious that has the most frequent and disturbing influence on
the ego because "its nature can in large measure be inferred from the
personal unconscious."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The next four lines, which in their pattern on the page imitate the
tension she describes, also draw on Jung's ideas. He thought the shadow
posed a moral problem for the whole ego-personality because "no one
can become conscious of [it] without considerable moral effort. To
become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the
personality as present and real."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
In lines seven to eleven, Levertov implies that the transmutation
Chillida achieves is a result both of active will and of receptivity to
his materials: he is the one who acts, of course, but he also understands
the proclivities of the iron and stone he works with. In his hands,

<b></b>



<blockquote>

iron accepting rapture, moving,
<br />
returning satisfied to its purpled
<br />
black density, secretly curved.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
And he "permits stone / to acknowledge the inward void it compresses"
(ibid). Her last two stanzas refer to his "Comb of Wind" group (<A
NAME="5" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#5"> 5</a>) which,
she imagines, were inspired by the sea, which she personifies, as well as
by the wind. In her extrapolation, Chillida has made combs for the sea's
"rushing tresses." These sculptures are "new gestures lifted / to the
wind, new spouts" from which the enlivened water leaps, "shouting" (ibid).
<p>
Other poems in <i>A Door in the Hive</i> also refer to specific works of
art, as well as attributes of the artist's vision, desire, and perceptual
process. For example, in "Wings in the Pedlar's Pack," Levertov compares
her father's experience of spiritual flight from Judaism to Christianity
with that of his countryman, Marc Chagall. In "Nativity: An Altarpiece,"
she refers to an anonymous church artifact, positing that in this piece
the "wondering animals" recognize the spiritual significance of Christ's
birth before the wise men or the sleeping shepherds. In "Ikon: The
Harrowing of Hell," she draws on the tradition of devotional painting in
the Eastern Orthodox Church to interpret Christ's descent into the realm
of the dead between the time of His Crucifixion and His Resurrection when,
according to Christian belief, he brought salvation to the souls

<b></b>

held captive. In this poem, written during Lent, she extends this
religious idea, imagining the difficulty of Christ's task to be not
only his rescue of the souls in Limbo, but also his painful return to
life, where he must "walk / the world again" and patiently await the
acts of human generosity that indicate communion and humble repentance
(<i>DIH,</i> 106). In "The Life of Art," she analyzes the ecstasy of even
a momentary change of perspective. Using the medium of "carnal paint" to
stand for all artistic media, she claims that "the borderland" between
one's medium and "fictive truth: a room, a vase, an open door / giving
upon the clouds" is the desired place to live. It is an "immeasurable,
elusive" psychological state, "an equilibrium" attainable sometimes,
"when the attention's rightly poised," during which one feels "opulently
received" into the world of the painting, and one almost sees "what
lies beyond the window, past the frame, beyond . . ." (<i>DIH,</i>
85). However, the poem in which she most fully expresses this boundary
experience is "The Composition," in her next book, <i>Evening Train</i>
, published after her final move to Seattle, an environment that
reminded her of her European home. Here ekphrasis enables her to fuse
social and spiritual concerns with issues of form.
<p>
The poem's title&#8212;"The Composition"&#8212;prompts us to see the
links between pictorial and poetic structure. As the epigraph indicates,
it was inspired by "Woman at the Harpsichord," a famous example of Dutch
genre painting in the mid-seventeenth century by Emmanuel de Witte,
an artist associated with the Delft School, who specialized in painting
church interiors. The painting depicts domestic life during what is often
considered a "golden age" of Dutch culture, the period after the United
Provinces of the Netherland, the first republic in Europe, had become
a major power and intellectual center, despite its small size, in part
because of its advanced shipbuilding industry, financial innovations,
and social organization. By this time most of the population in its three
most powerful provinces lived in small to medium-sized towns. While the
other states of Europe remained primarily rural, the Netherlands was
becoming a nation of townspeople, predominantly middle class.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Yet the particular bourgeois nature of Dutch society needs some
explanation. As Simon Schama has written, "At the center of the Dutch
world was a burgher not a bourgeois."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
The burgher was a "citizen first and <i>homo aeconomicus</i>
second. . . . the obligation of civism conditioned the opportunities of
prosperity" (<i>ER,</i> 7). This distinction is important to Levertov
both in her poem about the painting and in a letter explaining her
choice of subject.
<p>
"The Composition" is dedicated to the French poet Jean Joubert and the
American artist Howard Fussiner, both Levertov's contemporaries. Levertov
had included translations of fourteen of Joubert's poems in an earlier
book, <i>Oblique Prayers</i> , including a poem based on a painting
by Holbein. She chose to open this selection with "Wind Script," a poem
expressing the vulnerability and diminishment of language in the face
of the "weight of blood" in recent history: "Words are vulnerable: /
rain, fire, the errant hand, / confusion&#8212;all can assail them. . . ."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Joubert also deplored the prevalence of fracture and obliquity as
poetic techniques in contemporary poetry: "Then there are left only
splinters of language, / fallen letters, gray tatters / like voices
far across the valley, / which echoes fracture. And sometimes nothing"
(<i>OP,</i> 49). Her epigraph

<b></b>

acknowledges Howard Fussiner because he was a close friend with whom she
had been talking about paintings for many years. Fussiner remembers that,
on one occasion they had talked about the particular formal qualities
that made this painting of de Witte's a greater work than the average
genre painting, how it surpassed the depiction of mere anecdote.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Further, in a note to the poem, Levertov distinguishes her interpretation
of the depicted scene from that of the art historian, Witold Rybscinski,
whose book <i>Home: A Short History of an Idea</i>, she had read.
<p>
In his interpretation, Rybscinski focuses on the res in the foreground
of the story de Witte depicts, the woman playing the harpsichord
and the man listening in the curtained bed near her (<a name="6"
HREF="10.3hollenberg_res.html#6"> 6</a>). Rybscinski detects a
hint of adultery beneath the surface of this idyllic domestic scene. He
notes that closer inspection reveals that the woman is not playing
for herself alone, but also for a man on the bed behind the curtains,
whose clothing is fully visible on the chair. He writes, "The hilt of a
sword that is barely within the picture and the casual fashion in which
the clothes have been flung on the chair . . . hint, in a delicate way,
that this may not be the woman's husband."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Since marital infidelity was frowned on in Holland, he sees the other
re in the painting, the maid sweeping the floor in the distance,
as part of a cautionary allegory suggesting "Cleanliness is next to
godliness."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Levertov's poem conveys a different story which she asserts is "equally
valid." She begins with the view "two rooms away,

<b></b>

seen through the open door," where she imagines that the servant girl
also listens to the music the young wife plays.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
By beginning with the view in the distance, Levertov calls attention to de
Witte's skillful use of perspective in this painting. She is also attuned
to the evocative contrasts between light and shadow in his work, to the
significance of the color red, and to the meanings of the wife's music
making. In the painting, the direct recession into depth is balanced
with forms spaced at rhythmic intervals from side to side. Zones of
space are layered and interrelated by a continuous interplay of solid
and void. This complex design is mirrored in Levertov's doubled point of
view in her poem. Although at the outset she stands outside the painting,
looking in through the doorway, to the extent that she identifies with
the servant girl, "timing the strokes of her broom to the music's crisp /
golden wavelets," she is also inside the painting, looking out. Levertov
notes the particular quality of the sunlight filtered through the windows
and the patterns of light and dark it makes on the floor:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->. . . Autumn sun
<br />
and shadows well-defined overlay the floortiles,
<br />
antiphonal transverse strips over squares
<br />
of white and black . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<div align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
[<i>ET,</i> 24].
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
She underlines the predominance of the color red, "red, / red is the
lord of color here," repeating that "a glowing Indian red" is the color
of the draperies, bedside carpet, ceiling beams, elaborate hanging lamp,
a chair, and "above all, / with its canopy, valance, ample curtains, / the
big four-poster" bed (ibid). In the context of this sequence of ekphrastic
poems I have selected, we are reminded of Soutine's "red steps," and that
this color often connotes violence and blood as well as fire and passion,
as in the sentence, "he was caught red-handed." But in this interior,
although Dutch colonies in the Americas are suggested by the phrase
"Indian red," Levertov stresses domesticity. The man's sword is cast on
the chair; he is "snug" in bed listening and not hunting and killing,
or even trading. De Witte's use of this provocative color is not the
desperate response to rejection and catastrophe we find in Soutine,
Levertov suggests, but rather a "brave resplendent red," related to
the "twang and trill" of the music, possibly a piece by Monteverdi,
"ringing out" from under the wife's fingers (ibid). In fact, with such
words as "antiphonal" and "counterpoint," words that refer both to
the compositional lines in the painting and to the musical qualities
of a harpsichord composition, Levertov turns the painting's reference
to music to her own meta-artistic purpose (ibid). Through de Witte's
"austere counterpoint of forms," the sentimental content of the painting
is purified and sublimated by its transposition into the world of music;
space and sound commingle (ibid). There are several subtexts here, she
implies, not only social ones, but possibly an aesthetic one as well. In
the shift in aesthetic thinking that marked the Romantic period to come,
art is prized less as an imitation of reality, as it was earlier when
the <i>ut pictura poesis</i> analogy held sway, than as an expression
of the human spirit.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Consequently, in place of painting, music became the art perceived to

<b></b>

have the most profound affinity with poetry during the Romantic period. By
referencing both arts in this way Levertov detaches herself from her
modernist predecessors and contemporaries who stress the impersonality
of art. Instead, she makes art an analogue of the artist it expresses,
and encourages our identification with the artist's point of view.
<p>
Levertov clarified the salutary aspects of the Dutch golden age she
perceived in this painting in a letter to Howard Fussiner and David
Eberly, defending it against their observations that de Witte's handling
of the servant girl could imply elitism and that she might be idealizing
and sentimentalizing his view of class structure. Levertov comments that
"Americans are particularly liable to a lack of historical perspective
on such an issue" since they are "brought up to identify the concept of
democracy with that of egalitarianism."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Levertov explains that Americans forget that their kind of democracy
offers "(theoretically) equal <i>opportunity</i> not <i>equality,</i>"
and that this unexamined egalitarianism "had the effect of undermining
the working-class pride which (until recently) sustained European labor
unions; a pride which wanted better conditions but didn't even dream
of changing <i>class</i>, and did not desire it" (<i>LFE</i>). She
continues: "Just as it is easy to sentimentalize a situation by
idealizing it, so it is easy to sentimentalize by placing it in a
negative light, such as assuming (by implication not in so many words)
that all labor is alienated" (ibid). She goes on to explain that,
in fact, at this time in Holland, "general prosperity" combined with
"habitable architecture" and "liberality of social atmosphere made the
lives of servants, and of women in general, much less oppressive than in
many other periods" (ibid). Most important, she points out that in her
poem, she "did not claim that that society was Utopia, in the sense of
being <i>the ideal</i>" but rather a representation of what she perceives



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
as a historical moment that was an 'apex of civilized joy,' i.e. different
from an exclusively <i>personal</i> moment of joy (such as a surge of
'animal spirits,' . . .)  in being made possible, and being <i>a part
of</i>, a historical, economic, architectural, material context. The
painting records (but not merely as anecdote!&#8212;records in the
character of its <i>composition</i>) a joyful scene involving primarily
a couple, but participated in to some extent by the maid . . . which
is at the same time (like the painting itself, so that the painting
which records is itself part of <i>what</i> it records) a manifestation
of a civilization: European civilization at a peak which has not been
surpassed and probably will not be matched. . . . Definitely not Utopia
because the merchant riches of that society derived in part from trades
abroad involving oppressed workers in oppressive societies&#8212;including
slavery. But <i>domestically,</i> relatively exemplary.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->

<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
That Levertov was interested in the linkage between issues of power and
social governance and issues of form not only in Holland in 1660 but in
contemporary America is clear when we consider that <i>Evening Train</i>
also includes a section of poems titled "Witnessing From Afar," many of
which respond explicitly to America's involvement in the Gulf War. The
achievement of "peaceful joy" shown in this painting reflects a dream of
social justice partially realized in the Dutch golden age, but always and
everywhere a desideratum. Levertov's comment in her letter to Fussiner
and Eberly that

<b></b>

this joyful scene is recorded not only in the content of the painting
but in "the character of its composition," reminds us that she employs
ekphrasis in the service of a similar dream (ibid). The awareness of
difference inherent in this genre, particularly the desire to connect
with an "other," informs her poem's theme and structure. It is obvious in
the overt connections Levertov makes across class boundaries, between
the servant girl and the young wife, and across gender boundaries,
between the happily married man and woman, both of which are in the
"human scene" she depicts in the first stanza. These are expressed in
a verse paragraph that is flowing, conversational, and also reflective,
wherein the speaker addresses herself as well the audience.
<p>
The desire for connection is also evident in the second verse paragraph,
shorter and more urgent, in which the speaker addresses her audience
more directly:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
<span style="margin-left: 10em; margin-bottom:0;">But if
<br /></span>
the same scene had been painted differently&#8212;
<br />
not only with other colors, but from another
<br />
distance, perspectives differently disposed, more curves,
<br />
less play of severe rectangles if it had been
<br />
a composition that lacked this austere
<br />
counterpoint of forms which evoke,
<br />
in brave resplendent red, the very
<br />
twang and trill and wiry
<br />
ground bass of the notes ringing forth
<br />
under her fingers&#8212;if it had been
<br />
reduced to anecdote&#8212;we'd never have known
<br />
that once, in eternity,
<br />
this peaceful joy had blessed an autumnal morning.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<div align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
[<i>ET,</i> 24, 25]
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Levertov supposes a comparison between de Witte's painting and other
depictions of the same subject, which if "painted differently&#8212;not
only with other colors but from another / distance, perspectives
differently disposed," would be less powerful. The phrase "another
distance" (heightened by the line break) suggests not only other genre
paintings of de Witte's period but of other historical periods as well,
including our own. It also reaches toward a timeless realm of no past
or future which is associated with divinity. Levertov's aim here is
connection with the eternal, or at least with de Witte's ability, through
his painting, to preserve forever the aura of this glowing, domestic
interior. She employs the "still moment," a literary topos in which
poetry imitates the visual arts by "stopping time, or more precisely
by referring to an action through a still moment that implies it"
(<i>CR,</i> 40). The realization of her goal is, of course, impossible,
given the ephemeral quality of human life and the fundamental temporality
of poetry as structures of sounds in time.
<p>
The distinction between temporal and spatial modes, aural and visual
media, are familiar oppositions of semiotics. W. J. T. Mitchell has
pointed out that they put a special pressure upon the ekphrastic
encounter. Since the visual work can never really be made present by
the poem, it must be "conjured up as a potent absence or a fictive,

<b></b>

ral" presence (<i>PT,</i> 158). In fact, the evocation of just such
a potent absence or ral presence is central to Levertov's thematic
purposes here. Her emphasis on the act of composition itself, in which
matter is trans-substantiated by artistic form, is important to her,
especially during this period in her life, because it is analogous to and
derivative from the Christian belief in the "real presence" of incarnate
divinity in the Eucharist.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Earlier she had based her ideas about "organic form" on "an intuition
of an order, a form beyond forms, in which forms partake, and of which
man's creative works are analogies, resemblances, natural allegories"
(<i>NSE,</i> 68). Although she had drawn on Gerard Manley Hopkins's
concepts of "inscape" and "instress" to formulate this concept, she
had couched this Roman Catholic poet's sacramental view of the world
in Platonic language. However, by the time these ekphrastic poems were
written she was a practicing Catholic, and though still frequently
wracked by doubt, she had written other poems, inspired by passages of
the Gospel or the lives of saints, that she described as examples of
"do-it-yourself-theology" (<i>NSE,</i> 249). Perhaps most important, she
had, through this poetry, "worked through to a theological explanation"
of the theodicy problem&#8212;God's nonintervention in "the global
panorama of oppression and violence"&#8212;by newly experiencing the
implications of human choice. As she put it, "God's nature, as Love,
demands a freely given requital from that part of the creation which
particularly embodies Consciousness: the Human" (<i>NSE,</i> 251). The
"imagination of faith" acted as "yeast" in her life as a writer, and
composing poems became "work that enfaiths" (<i>NSE,</i> 257,255).
<p>
Levertov's awareness of the difference between de Witte's surpassing
vision in this painting and that of more mundane genre painters in
his time, as well as her knowledge of the gap between his social
context and our own, infuses "The Composition" with existential and
religious pathos. She repeats the word "if" three times, stressing the
conditional nature of his achievement (<i>ET,</i> 24, 25). The phrase
"reduced to anecdote" may refer not only to the stories told in other
genre paintings but to our contemporary tendency to dismiss religious
beliefs as mere myths or stories. Also, her words, "once, in eternity,"
introduce an important note of irony. The historical understanding that
coexists with the insistent otherworldliness of Levertov's desire here
only makes the desire more powerful as a form of postmodern witness. The
"still moment" achieved through this poem's expression of ekphrastic
hope has a radiance that is enhanced by the tragic knowledge behind
it, which Levertov calls our attention to in her phrase, "we'd never
have known." This is a knowledge amply attested to by the other poems I
discussed as well. Whether immersed in the tragedies of twentieth-century
history, like Kiefer and Soutine, or expressive of transformation, like
Duvet and Chillida, all of these poems, like the works of art which
inspire them, resist political domination in forms that are clearly
accessible to her audience. Although Levertov has grown increasingly
conscious of the darker levels to which human beings can descend and
to the vulnerability of language, she continues to draw from a deep
well of religious and humanist value. Her poetry remains answerable to
"what should be" as well as to "things as they are," as Seamus Heaney
put it recently, arguing eloquently for the power of poetry, even at
its most desolate, to "strengthen the individual's moral sense," as well

<b></b>

as his "feeling of personal dignity" and "trust in human solidarity."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Thus, she provides an ethical and political model for her reader. In
these ekphrastic poems, in the company of visual artists whose vision
she shares, Levertov maintains faith in human possibility. As she wrote
of her early experience of paintings in a museum, in a poem which
foreshadows her creation of comparable verbal structures: "Here was
history / / as I desired it" (<i>CIB,</i> 48).

Mitchell identifies three characteristic phases of realization
accompanying ekphrasis. The first he calls "ekphrastic indifference,"
which grows out of a commonsense perception that ekphrasis is impossible;
the second is "ekphrastic hope," in which this impossibility is overcome
in imagination or metaphor; the third is "ekphrastic fear," when we
sense that "the difference between verbal and visual representation
might collapse and the rative, imaginary desire of ekphrasis might
be realized literally and actually" (<i>PT,</i> 152-4).

<p>
The January  issue of  included a special
section, "Eliot and anti-Semitism: the Ongoing Debate," featuring Ronald
Schuchard's essay, "Burbank with a Baedeker, Eliot with a Cigar,"
in which he argued that the correspondence between T.S. Eliot and
Horace Kallen&#8212;a Zionist and philosophy professor at the New
School&#8212;contained evidence vindicating Eliot of the charge of
anti-Semitism. Followed by responses from several distinguished critics,
this section largely debated whether or not evidence supplied by the
Eliot-Kallen correspondence exonerated Eliot of the charge.
<p>
In the following short-essay/responses, modernist scholars extend the
debate beyond the question of whether or not Eliot was anti-Semitic
to consider how the (widely debated) relation of Eliot to Semitism
foregrounds aspects of modernism, literary history, and Jewish
intellectual history, including reflections on the current situation
in Israel.

<p>
<i>The life of images has taken a decisive turn in our time: the
oldest myth about the creation of living images, the fabrication
of an intelligent organism by artificial, technical means, has
now become a theoretical and practical possibility thanks to new
constellations of media at many different levels. The convergence of
genetic and computational technologies with new forms of speculative
capital has turned cyberspace and biospace, the inner structure of
organisms, into frontiers for technical innovation, appropriation,
and exploitation&#8212;new forms of objecthood and territoriality for
a new form of empire. In AI, Stephen Spielberg registers this change by
telling a story about the invention of an image that is, quite literally,
a "desiring machine." David, the contemporary answer to Pinocchio,
is a robot boy with dreams and desires, and with an apparently fully
elaborated human subjectivity. He is programmed to love and to demand
love, a demand that becomes so obsessive (he is in competition with his
real human "brother" for the love of his mother) that he is rejected and
becomes an orphan. To the question, "What do pictures want?" the answer
in this instance is clear: they want to be loved, and to be "real."</i>
<p>
<i>The genius of AI is not in its narrative, which is full of clunky,
implausible moments, but in its vision of a new world and its</i>

<b></b>

<i>new objects. David is a perfectly photogenic, adorable simulacrum of
a boy who is loveable and endearing in every way. The filmic point of
view encourages us to identify with him throughout, and to despise his
mother for rejecting him. Yet underlying the sickeningly sweet fantasy
of mother-son bliss (a utopian resolution of the Oedipus complex?) is the
horror of the double, the encounter with one's own mirror image rendered
autonomous, a horror that even the robot boy is capable of feeling when
he sees scores of his own duplicates on the assembly line, ready to be
packaged for the Christmas shopping season. The fantasy of AI, then, is
a kind of extreme exaggeration of the uncanny, when the old, familiar
phobia or superstition is realized in an unexpected way. This fantasy
was, of course, always already predicted from the moment of the creation
of Adam from the red clay of the ground, the creation of the first
drawing with the red earth of vermilion, the casting of the Golden Calf
from Egyptian gold. In our time, the materials are organic substances,
proteins, cells, DNA molecules, and the shaping, casting procedures are
computational. This is the age of biocybernetic reproduction, when (as
we suppose) images really do come alive and want things. What follows
is an attempt to sketch out a thick description of this moment, and to
assess some of the artistic practices that have accompanied it.</i>
<p>
The current revolutions in biology and computers signified here by the
images of the double helix and the Turing Machine (. <a name="1"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#1">1</a> and <a name="2"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#2">2</a>) and their implications
for ethics and politics raise a host of new questions for which the
arts, traditional humanistic disciplines, and Enlightenment modes of
rationality may seem ill-prepared. What good is it even to talk about
the human if a humanist like Katherine Hayles is right in arguing that
we live in a post-human age?
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
What is the point of asking the great philosophical questions about
the meaning of life, when we seem to be on the verge of reducing this
most ancient question of metaphysics to what Giorgio Agamben has called
"bare life," a matter of technical means, a calculable chemical process?
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
And what about the ancient mystery of death in a time of neomorts,
indefinitely extended comas, and organ transplants? Is death now
merely a problem to be solved by engineering and adjudicated by
lawyers? What is the structure of scientific and technical knowledge
itself? Is it a set of logically validated statements and propositions,
a self-correcting discursive system? Or is it riddled with images,
metaphors, and fantasies that take on a life of their own, and turn the
dream of absolute rational mastery into a nightmare of confusion and
uncontrollable side effects? To what extent are the widely heralded
technical innovations in biology and computation themselves mythic
projections or symptoms, rather than determining causes? Above all,
who is in a position to reflect on these questions, or rather, what
disciplines have the tools to sort out these issues? Do we call on the
artists or the philosophers, the anthropologists or the art historians,
or do we turn to the proponents of hybrid formations like "cultural
studies?" Do we rely on the genetic engineers and computer hackers to
reflect on the ethical and political meaning of their work? Or do we
turn to the new field called "bioethics," a profession that requires
fewer credentials than we expect from a hairdresser, and which is in
danger of becoming part of the publicity apparatus of the

<b></b>

corporations whose behavior they are supposed to monitor&#8212;or as
in the case of George W. Bush's Presidential Council on Bioethics,
a front for the reassertion of the most traditional Christian pieties
and phobias about the reproductive process?
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
I can not promise clear and unequivocal answers to these questions,
a set of dialectical theses on the order of Walter Benjamin's 1935
manifesto, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." I
can offer, however, a target for inquiry, the concept of "biocybernetic
reproduction." The questions, then, are as follows: what is biocybernetic
reproduction? What is being done with it by way of critical and artistic
practice, and what could be done?


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Biocybernetics
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Biocybernetic reproduction is, in its narrowest sense, the combination of
computer technology and biological science that makes cloning and genetic
engineering possible. In a more extended sense, it refers to the new
technical media and structures of political economy that are transforming
the conditions of all living organisms on this planet. Biocybernetics
ranges from the most grandiose plans to engineer a brave new world of
perfect cyborgs to the familiar scene of the American health club, where
obese, middle aged consumers are sweating and straining while wired up
to any number of digital monitors that keep track of their vital signs
and even more vital statistics&#8212;especially the number of calories
consumed. It is not limited to the pristine lab

<b></b>

populated with white-coated technicians and electronically controlled
media, but encompasses the world of the messy, chaotic computer station,
destructive viruses, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
<p>
I adopt the polysyllabic tongue-twisting term "biocybernetics" rather
than the more compact "cybernetics" in order to foreground a fundamental
dialectical tension in this concept. The word "cybernetics" comes
from the Greek word for the "steersman" of a boat, and thus suggests a
discipline of control and governance. Norbert Wiener called cybernetics
"the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the
machine or animal." "Bios," on the other hand, refers to the sphere
of living organisms which are to be subjected to control, but which
may in one way or another resist that control, insisting on "a life
of their own." "Biocybernetics," then, refers not only to the field
of control and communication, but to that which eludes control and
refuses to communicate. In other words, I am questioning the notion
that our time is adequately described as the "age of information," the
"digital age," or the age of the computer, and suggesting a more complex
and conflicted model, envisioning all these models of calculation and
control as interlocked in a struggle with new forms of incalculability
and uncontrollability, from computer viruses to terrorism.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
The age of information might better be called the age of mis- or
dis-information, and the era of cybernetic control is&#8212;if my
daily newspapers are telling me the truth&#8212;more like an epoch of
loss of control. In short, far from being technically determined in
any straightforward way by computers and the internet, the digital age
spawns new forms of fleshly, analogue, non-digital experience, and the
age of cybernetics engenders new breeds of biomorphic entities, among
which we must number intelligent machines such as "smart bombs," and
those even more intelligent machines known as "suicide bombers." The
final result of the smart bomb and the suicide bomber is the same,
namely, the creation of a biocybernetic life form, the reduction of a
living being to a tool or machine, and the elevation of a mere tool or
machine to an intelligent, adaptable creature.
<p>
In invoking the concept of the "bios" as a zone of resistance and
incalculability, I do not posit some reservoir of "vital forces" that
stand against the mechanical and rational operations of cybernetics. My
aim, rather, is to observe that within the very heart of the cybernetic
the bios rears its head in very concrete forms&#8212;most conspicuously
in the computational virus&#8212;but also in subtler forms such as the
decay of information found in the phenomenon of "Lossy compression."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
I also stress the two-way operation of the disintegration of oppositions
between the mechanical and the organic. It's not simply that living
things become like machines, but that machines more than ever behave now
like living things, and that the line between hardware and software
is increasingly entangled with a third zone that might be called
"wetware." At the more global level of macroorganisms, it is impossible
to ignore the emergence of a biocybernetic paradigm in the work of
computer researchers such as Alberto Laszlo-Barabasi, who remarks that
"internet researchers are like doctors trying to re out what their
patient looks like." "Redundancy in the network" has reached a complexity
"that resembles what biologists have found in living organisms," while
(on the other side) "some biologists hope that such studies [of the
internet] may help them find

<b></b>

clues to the deeper mysteries of nature."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Internet artists such as Lisa Jevbratt take quite seriously the metaphor
of the Internet as a living organism. Jevbratt, in fact, believes that
it is a <i>dying</i> organism, and her work is devoted to making visible
its vital processes and pathological tendencies.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
It might be useful here to put biocybernetics in the larger theoretical
and historical framework of semiotics and iconology (the study of signs
and images). From this broader perspective, the relation of the "bios"
and the "cyber" is a re-writing of the traditional dialectics between
nature and culture, human beings and tools, artifacts, machines, and
media&#8212;what we used to call the whole "man-made world." It also
reenacts the ancient struggle between the image and the word, the idol and
the law. The cyber-steersman is the digital code, the alphanumeric system
of calculation and iterability that makes language and mathematics the
controlling instruments of human rationality, from cunning calculation
to wise estimation. As Northrop Frye once noted, the real gift to man
on Mt. Sinai was not the moral law, which was already known in oral
tradition, but the semiotic law, which replaced pictographic writing
systems with a phonetic alphabet, analog writing with the digital.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The Cyber is the judge and differentiator, the one who rules by writing
the code. Bios, on the other hand, tends toward the analogical register,
or the "message without a code" as Roland Barthes described it in the
context of photography.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
It is the domain of perception, sensation, fantasy, memory, similitude,
pictures&#8212;in short, what Lacan calls the Imaginary. Traditionally
these categories stood in stable hierarchies: reason, the logos. The
Symbolic was supposed to rule, and the image was relegated to the
sphere of emotions, passions, and appetites. That is why admonitions
against idolatry and fetishism are so often associated with accusations
of materialism and sensuality. But here is the curious twist in our
time. The digital is declared to be triumphant at the very same moment
that a kind of frenzy of the image and spectacle is announced. Which
is it? The word or the image? Raymond Bellour notes that "all French
reflection for half a century has been drawn between the pincers of
the word and the image," a pattern that he traces in Lacan, Deleuze,
Barthes, and Foucault. Bellour compares this weaving of word and image,
discourse and re, fantasy and the law to a "double helix" of signs
and sensations that constitutes the evolution of new media and new
"image species" in our time.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
As Bellour's metaphor of the helix suggests, the word-image
dialectic seems to be reappearing at the level of life
processes themselves. An image of this appearance is provided
in a film still from <i>Jurassic Park</i> (<a name="3"
href="10.3mitchell_res.html#3"> 3</a>), in which a
velociraptor is caught in the projector beam of the park's orientation
film, its skin serving as a screen for the display of the DNA codes
that were used in cloning the creature from fossil traces of living
tissue. This image provides a metapicture of the relation of digital
and analogical codes, the script of DNA and the visible organism that
it produces.
<p>
I will spare you a detailed argument that something like biocybernetic
reproduction is indeed the technical and scientific dominant of our age,
that biology has replaced physics at the frontiers of science, and that
digital information has replaced the physical quanta of mass and energy
as dominant forms of imagined materiality. Anyone who has read Donna
Haraway on cyborgs, or watched science fiction movies over

<b></b>

the last twenty years cannot fail to be struck by the pervasiveness of
this theme.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Films such as <i>Blade Runner,Alien,The Matrix,Videodrome,The Fly,The
Sixth Day,AI,</i> and <i>Jurassic Park</i> have made clear the host of
fantasies and phobias clustering around biocybernetics: the spectre
of the "living machine," the re-animation of dead matter and extinct
organisms, the destabilizing of species identity and difference,
the proliferation of prosthetic organs and perceptual apparatuses,
and the infinite malleability of the human mind and body have become
commonplaces of popular culture.
<p>
The contrast between the mechanical and biocybernetic model is vividly
illustrated by the "new model" cyborg of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
<i>Terminator 2</i>. Schwarzenegger plays the role of a traditional
robot, a mechanical assembly of gears, pulleys, and pistons driven by a
computer brain and the most advanced servo-motors. He is faced, however,
with a new model terminator composed of "living metal," a shape-shifting
chimera that is a universal mimic, capable of taking on any identity. By
the end of this film, we are prepared to be nostalgic for the good old
days of mechanical men who could express regret for their inability to
cry, and to feel horror at the new re of infinite mutability and
mutation, remorselessly pursuing the extinction of the human species.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
I will state it as a bald proposition, then, that biocybernetic
reproduction has replaced Walter Benjamin's mechanical reproduction as
the fundamental technical determinant of our age.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
If mechanical reproducibility (photography, cinema, and associated
industrial processes like the assembly line) dominated the era of
modernism, biocybernetic reproduction (high-speed computing, video,
digital imaging, virtual reality, the internet, and the industrialization
of genetic engineering) dominates the age that we have called
"postmodern." This term, which played its role as a place-holder in

<b></b>

the 1970s and 80s, now seems to have outlived its usefulness, and is
ready to be replaced by more descriptive notions such as biocybernetics
(although even as we move toward this more positive description, it will
be important not to forget the project of postmodernism to go beyond
narrow notions of technical determination toward reconstructing the
entire cultural framework of an era).
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Benjamin and Biocybernetics
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
If we pursue the question of biocybernetics in the spirit of Walter
Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,"
then every term needs to be re-examined. "Art" or "Kunst," as Benjamin
already saw, does not merely signify the traditional arts of painting,
sculpture, and architecture, but the entire range of new technical media
(photography, cinema, radio, television) emerging in his time. The "work"
itself is highly ambiguous as to the art object (the "Kunstwerk"), the
medium of art, or the very task (the work as "Kunstarbeit") to which
the arts ought to be committed. "Reproduction" and "reproducibility"
mean something quite different now when the central issues of technology
are no longer "mass production" of commodities or "mass reproduction"
of identical images, but the reproductive processes of the biological
sciences and the production of infinitely malleable, digitally animated
images. What does it mean when the paradigmatic object on the assembly
line is no longer a mechanism but an engineered organism? And how is the
life of this organism altered when the medium in which it thrives is
a fusion of digital and analogical codes, the "eyewash," as Friedrich
Kittler puts it, of the apparent sensuous output, and the stream of
alphanumeric ciphers that lies beneath it?
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
I focus here on three consequences of the new mode of biocybernetic
reproduction, each of which has its counterpart in Benjamin's analysis
of mechanical reproduction, which I will posit as three categorical
claims: first, the copy is no longer an inferior or decayed relic of the
original, but is in principle an improvement on the original; second,
the relation between the artist and work, the work and its model, is both
more distant and more intimate than anything possible in the realm of
mechanical reproduction; and third, a new temporality, characterized by
an erosion of the event, and a vertiginous deepening of the relevant past,
produces a peculiar sense of "accelerated stasis" in our sense of history.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
First, the issue of original and copy entailed in
"reproducibility." Benjamin famously argued that the advent of
photographic copies was producing a "decay of the aura"&#8212;a
loss of the unique presence, authority, and mystique of the original
object. Biocybernetic reproduction carries this displacement of the
original one further step, and in doing so, reverses the relation of
the copy to the original. Now we have to say that the copy has, if
anything, even <i>more</i> aura than the original. More precisely, in a
world where the very idea of the unique original seems a merely nominal
or legal fiction, the copy has every chance of being an improvement or
enhancement of whatever counts as the original. The digital reproduction
of sounds and visual images, for instance, need not involve any erosion
of vividness or lifelikeness, but can actually

<b></b>

improve on its original material. Photographs of artworks can be
"scrubbed" to remove flaws and dust; in principle, the effects of aging
in an oil painting could be digitally erased, and the work restored
to its pristine originality in a reproduction. Of course this would
still constitute a loss of the aura that Benjamin associated with the
accretion of history and tradition around an object, but if aura means
recovering the original vitality, literally, the "breath" of life of the
original, then the digital copy can come closer to looking and sounding
like the original than the original itself. Indeed the miraculous
programming framework of Adobe Photoshop even preserves the "history"
of transformations between original and copy so that any transformations
can be reversed.
<p>
This point becomes even more evident when we think about the manipulation
of <i>genetic</i> copies and originals. Cloning is a process which,
in principle, is meant not only to produce an identical twin of the
original organic tissue or organism, but to produce an improved and
enhanced copy. Our children or our cloned descendants will give the
phrase "she is the image of her mother," a new meaning, with the implied
promise that the child's genetic makeup will have been "scrubbed" of
the flaws that made the parent a less than perfect specimen. The film
<i>Gattacca,</i> whose title is composed of the four letters of the DNA
molecular code, provides a vivid imagining of the brave new world promised
by this process of an ever-improved copying of life-forms. Eduardo Kac's
experiments with transgenic artworks promise to produce surprising
new organisms by creating a web site which responds interactively to
"hits" from visitors by producing mutations in micro-organisms. Kac's
experiments in splicing rabbit DNA with jellyfish protein are designed
to produce a rabbit that glows in the dark, a copy that has more aureole,
if not aura, than its original.
<p>
The second consequence of biocybernetics concerns the transformed
relation between artist and work, work and model effected by new tools
and apparatuses. In a striking analogy, Benjamin contrasts the era of
manual and mechanical reproduction with the res of the magician and
the surgeon, the painter and the cameraman: "The surgeon," says Benjamin,
"represents the polar opposite of the magician. The magician heals a sick
person by the laying on of hands; the surgeon cuts into the patient's
body. . . . Magician and surgeon compare to painter and cameraman. The
painter maintains in his work a natural distance from reality, the
cameraman penetrates deeply into its web."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
In the age of biocybernetic reproduction, two new res have appeared
on the scene. The cameraman is replaced by the designer of virtual
spaces and electronic architectures, and the surgeon adopts the new
techniques of remote, virtual surgery. The surgeon operates at an
unnatural distance from the patient's body, performing his gestures in
a remote location, such as another room, or perhaps even from another
country. He moves his hands inside of data gloves like a shaman making
passes over a virtual body, removing a virtual tumor with sleight of
hand. He is able to rehearse his movements on a virtual body many times
before the actual operation takes place. The digital miniaturization
of his movements allows him to cut deeper and finer than any operation
conceivable in traditional manual surgery. Similarly, the cyber artist
operates simultaneously within a closer and more distant relationship
to the real. In

<b></b>

the case of a performance artist like Stelarc, the materiality of the work
is the artist's own body, subjected to prosthetic surgeries that graft
on additional limbs, while the actualities of performance may involve
wiring the artist's body up to remote locations in other countries,
so that an interactive performance may be conducted in which spectators
control the movements of the artist's body.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
The relationship of artist-to-work-to-corporeal reality is thus made
more intimate than ever, at the same time the artist's subjectivity
is simultaneously dispersed and fragmented across the circuitry of
prosthetic limbs and remote control spectatorship (<a name="4"
href="10.3mitchell_res.html#4"> 4</a>).
<p>
But it is above all the sense of temporality that is transformed in the
age of biocybernetics. The very notion of an "age" defined by technical
determination has a different feel at the threshold of the twenty first
century. Benjamin wrote in the uneasy interim between two world wars
that had raised the technologies of mass death and extermination of
civilian populations to unprecedented heights, a time of crisis and
immediate danger punctuated by irreversible catastrophes and dramatic
technical innovations. We live in a time that is best described as a
limbo of continually deferred expectations and anxieties. Everything is
about to happen, or perhaps has already happened without our noticing
it. The ecological catastrophe of Don DeLillo's <i>White Noise,</i>
is a non-event. The Gulf War, according to Jean Baudrillard, did not
take place (although he has conceded that September 11<sup>th</sup>
very likely was an event of some sort, but

<b></b>

exactly what sort is still to be worked out). The human genome&#8212;the
very "secret of life" itself&#8212;is decoded, and yet everything
remains the same. The heralded new computer you bought last week will be
obsolete before you learn to use it properly. The simplest conceivable
mechanism for rationalizing political life with a decisive, calculable
event (namely, a "free election") turns out to be not so simple, and
the leadership of the world's most powerful nation is determined by a
debate about whether human hands or machines should be trusted to count
the vote. Needless to say, the human hands lost.
<p>
Even war, the most dramatic and defining historical event human beings can
experience, turns out in our time to take on a radically indeterminate
and nebulous shape. As I write, the United States is in a state of
war, but a new kind of ambiguous, undeclared war in which the enemy
is nowhere and everywhere, without a definite territory or identity,
located in faraway places like Afghanistan or Iraq, but living among us
in Florida, hiding in caves and secret bases, or dwelling in the open,
driving their mini-vans to the mall, like "sleeper cells" that can awaken
without warning to unleash plagues and destruction. The onset of this war
was experienced as a wrenching, visceral catastrophe of mass death and
destruction, and as a media event suffused by unreality and disbelief. The
conduct of the war will range from espionage, to diplomacy, and commando
raids to full-scale preemptive wars. It will be a war without a front,
a back, or a middle, a war of indefinite and probably unattainable
objectives. It already has established a permanent state of emergency
designed to consolidate the power of a single political party, and indeed,
of a small faction within that party. To call this a new form of fascism
is not to engage in name-calling, but to call a situation by its true name
<p>
Meanwhile, at the same moment that terrorism is being defined as the
greatest evil of our age, the most popular movie of our time is a
film called <i>Matrix,</i> which glorifies a small band of hacker
terrorists determined to bring down the entire world economic and
political system because they resent the fact that computers are
controlling human life. We live in a very peculiar time, in which more
media circulate more information to more people than ever before, and yet
when the phenomenon of "disconnection" has never been more dramatically
evident. Polls of the American electorate show widespread discontent
with practically every major policy position of the ruling party, at the
same time that its leader continues to enjoy unprecedented popularity,
and his party rolls to one victory after another. Every pundit expresses
wonder at the "disconnect" that plagues American public consciousness
(if such a phrase still has any meaning), and every analysis of this
"consciousness" suggests that it has become so irreconciliably divided
that Americans appear to be living on two different planets.
<p>
Walter Benjamin's prediction that the human race might be capable of
viewing "its own destruction as an aesthetic experience of the first
order" has come true in a long-running series of apocalyptic disaster
films.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The scenes broadcast from New York on September 11, 2001, had, as
many observers noted, been anticipated numerous times by Hollywood,
and it was even suggested that the terrorists timed the second plane's
collision with the south tower of the World Trade Center in the full
expectation that hundreds of video cameras would capture the event live,
and broadcast it over and over again around the world.

A Paleontology of the Present
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Every present moment has to define itself against some notion of the past,
and ours is no exception. Benjamin noted that modernity and mechanical
reproduction seemed to bring along with them a revival of primitive and
archaic formations: that modernist painting, for instance, was riddled
with traces of fetishism, and that modern cinema was fulfilling the
ancient dream of a universal hieroglyphic language that would repair the
damage done at the Tower of Babel. Our time has its share of fascination
with primitive pasts, and the new literalizing of the living, desiring
image is, as I've tried to show, the occasion for numerous revivals of
archaic and pre-modern fantasies about the creation of life. But now
our sense of the revived past is even deeper than the time-frames of
archaeology and anthropology. Now paleontology, the study of ancient
extinct life-forms (most notably the dinosaur), looms as the temporal
framework for the some of the most innovative achievements in art,
media, and technology. The still image of the raptor from <i>Jurassic
Park</i> (<a href="10.3mitchell_res.html#3"> 3</a>), like
a petrified fossil extracted from the stream of living time, captures
the paradox of biocybernetics perfectly. With its skin lit up with the
DNA codes that brought it to life, it is a dialectical image of the
most up-to-date and the most ancient forms of life&#8212;a technically
engineered organism <i>and</i> a world dominant creature that predates
the advent of mammals. Fused here in a single gestalt are the inseparable
but contrary twins of biotechnology, constant innovation and constant
obsolescence, the creation and extinction of life, reproductive cloning
and the annihilation of a species.
<p>
Art historian T. J. Clark has recently written about the modern era,
the time of Benjamin and Picasso and Lenin, as an era so remote from
our present as to require an "archaeology" to understand it.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
My own view is that the present is, in a very real sense, even more
remote from our understanding, and that we need a "paleontology of the
present," a rethinking of our condition from the perspective of deep
time, in order to produce a synthesis of the arts and sciences adequate
to the challenges we face. Artists such as Robert Smithson, Allan
McCollum, and Mark Dion, who have pioneered the introduction of natural
history themes into their art practices, have given us some guidance in
thinking about the task of art in relation to issues of deep ecology and
the spectre of extinction. Smithson saw his <i>Spiral Jetty</i> both as
a cosmic hieroglyphic, a product of modern earth-moving technologies,
and a geological trace, like the footprints of the dinosaurs,
spiraling into a "deep time" which makes our own historical and even
archaeological time-sense seem brief and shallow by comparison. Allan
McCollum brought painted concrete castings of dinosaur thigh bones into
the classical atrium of the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh to evoke the
way in which America's sense of the past has&#8212;at least since Thomas
Jefferson&#8212;simultaneously evoked the classical past of Greece and
the Roman Empire, and the even deeper past of a natural history that
links our nation's past to the fate of the giant erect reptiles that
once ruled the world (as America does now). Mark Dion'sinstallation
<i>Dinos R U.S. : When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,</i> inquires into
the obsession of typical American first-graders with extinct creatures
that dominated the world 70 million years ago. Why is it that the most
familiar, most highly publicized animal group on the planet

<b></b>

earth at this time is a group of creatures that have never been seen
outside of museums and movies?
<p>
The first conclusion of such a paleontology of the present might be
summed up by Fredric Jameson's remark that "it is now easier to imagine
the death of the human species than the end of capitalism." In Walter
Benjamin's time, the greatest accumulations of power were located in
the nation-state, the collective life-forms symbolized by Hobbes's
Leviathan. Adorno called the dinosaur a monument to the monstrous total
state, but in our time, it has become a re for a new monster, the
multinational corporation, locked in a Darwinian struggle of survival of
the fittest, in which new strategies of downsizing, flexibility, and rapid
adaptation (the virtues of the Velociraptor) have replaced the emphasis
on giantism of the old corporate giants (the power of the T. Rex).
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Any critique of this mode of production, then, that does not address the
corporation as life-form and Kunstwerk, and multinational capitalism
as its habitat, will miss the outer frame of this subject. Capitalism
is now the only game in town, a second nature that operates by and
appeals for legitimation to the impersonal, Darwinist logic of a first
nature that is red in tooth and claw. It is not merely that biotech
corporations are rapidly appropriating the copyrights to genetic codes
of newly engineered species of plants, animals, and foodstuffs, or that
they will soon be copyrighting human genes and farming human embryos,
but the deeper fact that these corporations are themselves biocybernetic
"forms of life," collective organisms that must destroy or devour their
rivals in order to survive. If cybernetics is the science of number
and computation, it is perhaps the perfect modus operandi for the
new-model corporation based in speculative finance capital (as distinct
from innovative, entrepreneurial capital), exemplified by the dot-com
bubble and the fabulous accounting procedures that made Enron appear
to be so profitable. (The Enron "partnerships" that were designed to
gobble up debt and improve the parent company's balance sheet were,
significantly, called "Raptors"). Standing over against these legitimate
or "normal" corporate entities, of course, are their dark counterparts,
the cartels of terrorism and international crime organizations, complete
with private armies and legitimate "front" operations. As Hyman Roth
said so prophetically to Michael Corleone in <i>Godfather II:</i>
"Michael, we're bigger than General Motors."

<!--_a-head-->
The "Work" of Art
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
What, then, is the "work" of art in this era? What is its task in the
face of biocybernetics, and the new corporate and physical bodies it is
spawning? The sheer volume and variety of new artistic production that
deals with the themes and issues of biocybernetics makes any summary
very difficult indeed. When I wrote the first draft of this essay in
the fall of 2000, a single show at Exit Art Gallery in New York was
able to assemble twenty artists who had something to say or show on this
topic. Since that time, scores of exhibitions and shows explicitly on this
theme have been organized. There is little agreement on what exactly the
"theme" in question is. For some artists, such as Janet Zweig, it appears
to be an eternally recurring issue, one that is continuous

<b></b>

with the first artistic imitations of life, the legendary cave
paintings of Lascaux. Zweig transfers hand-painted copies of these
cave paintings onto the side of a spool of computer tape imprinted
with the genetic codes of similar animals, as if to say that the
relation of the bios and cyber has always been with us (<a name="5"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#5"> 5</a>). Others treat genetic
technologies as the content of traditional media like painting and
sculpture. Alexis Rockman's <i>The Farm, 2000</i>depicts a soybean field
that, according to the artist's instructions, "is to be read from left to
right. The image begins with the ancestral versions of internationally
familiar animals, and moves across to informed speculation about how
they might look in the future."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Laura Stein's <i>Smile Tomato</i>carries the notion of genetically
altered fruits and vegetables to its logical extreme. If we can engineer
produce to maintain its fresh appearance (if not its taste) indefinitely,
why not design fruits and vegetables with smiley faces?
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Ron Jones's human-sized rendering of the genetic structure of cancer (<A
NAME="6" href="10.3mitchell_res.html#6"> 6</a>) in the
mode of Jean Arp's abstract sculptures reminds us of the very specific
role that sculptural modeling has played in genetic research<b>.</b>
The double helix structure of DNA has been compared to a Constructivist
monument, and biologist Robert Pollack (one of the pioneers of DNA

<b></b>

research) describes "the leap from DNA to protein" as a "transit from
line to shape, from signifier to signified . . . as if each sentence in an
encyclopedia were folded into a unique origami sculpture that carried its
meaning in its shape. . . . Bent, knotted, and folded, a cell's protein
sculptures look like the animals in Alexander Calder's wire circus."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Sculptural magnification is also at issue in Bryan Crockett's
<i>OncoMouse,</i> "the first patented transgenic lab mouse," which gives
the engineering of designer laboratory animals a grotesquely monumental
treatment. Crockett justifies the human scale of his 6 foot tall mouse
by linking it to the Christ re, calling it <i>Ecce Hommo Rattus,</i>
the principal sacrificial animal in the rituals of cancer research.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps the most disturbing and provocative sort of biocybernetic
art, however, is work that does not attempt to represent the genetic
revolution, but to participate in it. Eduardo Kac's installation,
<i>Genesis 1999,</i> is a "transgenic artwork linked to the internet,"
an interactive work that translates visits or "hits" on the installation's
website into instructions for random genetic mutations of microorganisms.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Transgenic art is, in Kac's words, "a new art form based on the use
of genetic engineering techniques to transfer synthetic genes to an
organism or to transfer natural genetic material from one species into
another in order to create unique living beings." Kac's most notorious
work is a rabbit named "Alba," produced by splicing jellyfish protein
with rabbit DNA. Alba is thus engineered to be a fluorescent rabbit,
though reportedly her "aureole" is only visible if one parts the fur
and examines the skin under a special light. There is, in addition,
a problem with actually exhibiting Alba, since the French government
lab that engineered the rabbit has declined to release it to the artist.

<b></b>

<p>
Kac's work dramatizes the difficulty biocybernetic art has in making its
object or model visible. In looking at the <i>Genesis</i> installation,
or hearing about the synthetic rabbit, one takes it on faith that the
work exists and is doing what it is reported to be doing. There is, in
a very real sense, nothing to see in the work, only documents, gadgets,
black boxes, and rumors of mutations and monsters. Perhaps this is the
point, and Kac's work is best viewed in the context of conceptual art,
which often renounces visual payoff. The object of mimesis here is
really the invisibility of the genetic revolution, its inaccessibility
to representation. The real subject matter, then, becomes the idea
of the work and the critical debate that surrounds it as much as its
material realization. In response to the predictable objection that the
work is a kind of irresponsible "playing" with genetic technologies,
Kac's equally predictable response is that purposeless play is at the
heart of the aesthetic gesture as such
<p>
A more pointed, simple, and direct use of conceptual art strategies
is offered by Larry Miller's <i>Genomic License</i> project, which
plays upon the patenting of animal and plant breeds by extending the
notion of commodification and property rights to the personal genes of
human beings. Miller copyrighted his own DNA in 1989, and has continued
the project since then of distributing genetic copyright forms as, in
his words, "a contribution to "Genesthetics," or art works that link
art, science, theology, and capitalism. A related project is <i>The
Creative Gene Harvest Archive,</i> part of an ongoing work by artists
Karl S. Mihail and Tran T. Kim-Trang entitled <i>Gene Genies Worldwide
Corporation.</i> This project, advertising itself as the "the cutting
edge of art and genetic engineering," aims to compile an archive of the
genes of "creative geniuses" in an attempt to improve the human species.
<p>
The blank irony and deadpan humor of these projects seems to leave any
critical perspective to the spectator. One art project that stands out for
its explicitly critical approach to biocybernetics is an internet-based
artists' collective known as Rtmark. One of the most notable productions
of this collective is <i>Biotaylorism 2000,</i> a half-hour automated
PowerPoint presentation designed by Natalie Bookchin of Cal Arts. As a
web-based entity, Rtmark presents itself as a new mutual fund designed
to highlight the risks and opportunities of biotechnology corporate
partnerships which are "scavenging the Third World and the interiors
of bodies for valuable genes." Rtmark links the contemporary race to
commodify the human genome with earlier state-sponsored programs in
racial eugenics and the rationalization of industrial processes known as
Taylorism, the subjection of every biological process to calculation and
control. Bobbing and weaving between deadpan humor, feigned enthusiasm
for the glorious profits to be made in biotech futures, and mordant
historical reminders of the questionable past of biocybernetics, Rtmark
has managed to insert itself into the corporate culture of biotechnology
as a kind of resident virus. The collective has, on occasion, even been
mistaken for a legitimate mutual fund, and has received invitations
to trade shows and to private consulting sessions with biotechnology
startups hungry for venture capital. Their proposals to make dazzling
profits on world hunger and designer babies sound very attractive in a
conversation riddled with optimistic projections about feeding the poor
and improving the lives of everyone. Rtmark has also developed a

<b></b>

new software application entitled <i>Reamweaver</i> (the name is a
spin-off on <i>Dreamweaver,</i> one of the leading hypertext programs for
the creation of websites). <i>Reamweaver</i> targets existing websites
such as the Celera Corporation or Monsanto, analyzes their content,
and automatically weaves a parodic, counter-web site in which the images
of corporate hype are systematically undermined. And it does all this,
Rtmark promises, while you sleep!
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Clearly there is no consensus on artistic strategies in
biocybernetics. And there is a real question about how well this art
can find a place in the traditional spaces of the gallery or museum,
given its invisible, often technical content; this question is coupled
with considerable uncertainty about what sort of medium or form it ought
to employ. Biocybernetics has probably found its best medium in the
cinema, where horror and science fiction provide spectacular images and
narratives of bio-dystopias (like the worlds depicted in <i>The Matrix</i>
or <i>Gattacca</i>).
<p>
However, some artists have found ways, in my view, to compete with
the effects of cinema within a more or less traditional gallery
space. Consider the work of Damien Hirst, whose experiments with "vitrine
art," the art of the glass box that preserves the biological specimen,
from the pickled shark to embryo to the bisected cow, have drawn so much
attention. In a recent work entitled <i>Love Lost</i> (<a name="7"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#7"> 7</a>), Hirst presents us
with a massive, ten foot high vitrine filled with water and live fish
swimming around a gynecological examination room. The room contains,
in addition to the examination table with its stirrups, a computer
station. The whole scene is rendered as if all the objects have been
underwater for a considerable period of time, as if we were looking at a
scene from a sunken city, a lost civilization like Atlantis. Hirst stages
one of the critical scenes of contemporary biocybernetics, the control
of women's bodies and reproductive processes as an archaic "lost world"
whose meaning is to be interpreted by the forensic imagination of the
spectator. Indeed, when I first saw this work at the Gagosian Gallery in
New York, spectators were swirling around it obsessively, like the fish
inside the tank, inspecting and interpreting every detail, as if they were
detectives or archaeologists inspecting the scene of a crime or disaster.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Antony Gormley's <i>Sovereign State</i> (<a name="8"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#8"> 8</a>) is the most
concentrated sculptural rendering I have seen of the dystopia of
biocybernetics. A mathematically expanded concrete casting of the artist's
own body lying on its side in a fetal position with large rubber hoses
attached to the body's orifices, the sculpture suggests that draining
and drinking, output and input are all tangled together in an image
of waste products recycled as food. This is a re of the neomort,
neonatal, or comatose human body, as if in suspended animation, like a
cryogenic incubator keeping someone alive until the next millennium; or
(if wired to a virtual reality network) one could imagine it as the exact
counterpart of the human inhabitants of <i>The Matrix.</i> As the title of
the piece suggests, Gormley's sculpture portrays absolute sovereignty, the
subject at one with itself, in harmonious, self-enclosed equilibrium. It
further enacts the reduction of bios to zoe, the living form to bare life.
<p>
I conclude by returning to the image of the digital raptor from
Spielberg's <i>Jurassic Park.</i> Like Gormley's <i>Sovereign State,</i>
Spielberg's image captures the dream of

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 498]</b>

biocybernetics, but carries it to the final illusion. This dream is not
just the indefinite maintenance of a life-form in perfect self-regulating
equilibrium, but the resurrection of extinct life with cybernetic
codes. The dream of control over life, its reduction to calculable
processes, is here projected as the ultimate fantasy: not just the
conquest of death (as in the biocybernetic myth of <i>Frankenstein</i>),
but the conquest of <i>species</i> death by cloning the DNA of extinct
creatures. This fantasy of cybernetic control is, of course, exactly what
the film's narrative puts into question. At the moment of this film still,
the raptor has just broken into the control room of the dinosaur park, and
is looking to devour the controllers. The DNA codes which express mastery
over the reproductive processes of extinct animals have unleashed flesh
and blood creatures who have taken over their own means of reproduction.
<p>
The digital dinosaur is a biocybernetic updating of the oldest myth about
the creation of life, that life begins with the word of god, and the word
is made flesh, a corporeal image of the creator&#8212;an image that, as
we know, inevitably rebels against its creator. Biocybernetics is about
the attempt to control bodies with codes and images with language. The
analogy between biogenetic engineering of organisms and digital animation
of graphic images is perfected in this re, as if someone had hit the
"reveal codes" button to expose the digital basis of both the creature
itself, and its cinematic representation. Perhaps this, then, is one
task of art in the age of biocybernetic reproduction, to reveal the
codes and expose the illusion of the ultimate mastery of life. Another
task would be the elaboration of what I have called a "paleontology
of the present," a discipline that would begin by acknowledging that
contemporaneity is perhaps even more mysterious to us than the recent or
distant past, and that would proceed by insisting on the connectedness
of all forms of life, a project that might put cybernetics to work for
human values. Still another task is the re-articulation of what we mean
by the human, by humanism, and the humanities, an inquiry in which all
the things we have learned about "identity" and identity politics in the
postmodern era would be applied to the ultimate question of <i>species</i>
identity. Finally, there would be the question of the image, and the
Imaginary, itself. If we are indeed living in a time of the plague of
fantasies, perhaps the best cure that artists can offer is to unleash
the images, in order to see where they lead us, how they go before us. A
certain tactical irresponsibility with images might be just the right
sort of homeopathic medicine for what plagues us.
<p>
<p>
Walter Benjamin concluded his meditation on mechanical reproduction
with the spectre of mass destruction. The dangerous aesthetic pleasure
of our time is not mass destruction but the mass creation of new, ever
more vital and virulent images and life-forms. The epithet for our times,
then, is not the modernist saying "things fall apart," but the even more
ominous slogan "things come alive." Artists, technicians, and scientists
have always been united in the imitation of life, the production
of images and mechanisms that have, as we say, "lives (and desires)
of their own." Perhaps this moment of accelerated stasis in history,
when we feel caught between the utopian fantasies of biocybernetics
and the dystopian realities of biopolitics, between the rhetoric of the
post-human and the real urgency of universal human rights, is a moment
given to us for rethinking just what our lives, and our arts, are for.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Repugnance is often an emotional bearer of deep wisdom, beyond reason's
power fully to articulate it. Can anyone really give an argument fully
adequate to the horror which is father-daughter incest (even with consent)
or having sex with animals or eating human flesh, or even just raping
or murdering another human being? Would anyone's failure to give full
rational justification for his revulsion at these practices make that
revulsion ethically suspect? Not at all. In my view, our repugnance at
human cloning belongs in this category.

The notion of digitization as a universal solvent has been a commonplace
in media studies, from Marshall McLuhan's vision of an electrified
global village, to Friedrich Kittler's claim that "any medium can be
translated into any other" in the age of computers. See <i>Gramaphone
Film Typewriter</i> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999),
2. This sort of statement underestimates the effects and difficulties of
translation. The age of cybernetic "communication" and "translatability"
would be better described as an electronic Babel in which every device
requires an intermediate device to speak to every other device. I'm happy
to see, in this regard, that new media theorists like Lev Manovich are
now rejecting the digital as a master term, but I'm not reassured by
Manovich's substitution of the "programmable," since that only raises
the dialectical problem of the unprogrammable. See <i>The Language of
New Media</i> (Cambridge, Mass. : MIT Press, 2001).

The robot boy, David, of Spielberg's <i>AI</i> is thus much more
disturbing than the new model terminator, whose skills never enlist
audience sympathy, even in his moment of spectacular "melt-down,"
when he morphs rapidly through all the personas he has adopted during
the film. Perhaps the most terrifying moment in the film is when the
Terminator impersonates the voice of the son, and then the body of his
mother, playing both sides of the Oedipal drama that structures <i>AI.</i>

One could debate whether Benjamin intended "mechanical" reproduction
in its strictest sense; the key word in the title of his essay could
also be translated&#8212;or even transliterated&#8212;as "technical,"
not mechanical. This translation has now achieved a kind of independent
authority, however, and in any case the claim that we are dealing with new
forms of "technical reproduction" (biocybernetic rather than mechanical)
would still obtain.

It seems clear that postmodernism has now become a historicist, period
term for the era beginning with the 1960s and ending somewhere around
the fall of the Berlin wall, roughly 1968-1990. My sense is that it
had its greatest leverage on historical thinking in the 1980s, when it
served as the rallying point for numerous projects in the critique of
politics and culture.

in the literature on Benjamin and in other contexts. The problem of the
copy is perhaps most famously theorized in Baudrillard's concept of the
simulacrum, and the problem of temporality has been discussed extensively
by Fredric Jameson. For a recent treatment of this issue, see Jameson,

Evonne Levy raises an interesting question about Laura Stein's tomato
in relation to the artistic tradition of idealization. The notion of
an idealizing function for the artist, as a perfecter and improver of
images (and perhaps of life-forms) seems to be displaced by work of
this sort by an idealization of the biological scientist, who works
to improve species through genetic engineering. Does this mean that
the artist now is mainly consigned to counter-images of idealization,
in which the "improvements" promised by genetics are critiqued, mocked,
and satirized by the artist? Or is there still room for a positive role
for the artist in the age of biocybernetics?

Recall here Walter Benjamin's claim that Atget photographed the empty
Paris streets "like scenes of a crime" . Hirst does something
similar, I suspect, with enigmatic installations that elicit a forensic
response from the beholder. What Hirst's "pictures" want, then, is
precisely a decoding, a tabulating of clues, traces, and indices that
lead the spectator to the construction of a scenario or narrative.

Rethinking Eliot, Jewish Identity, and Cultural Pluralism

<p>
Since first publishing my essay, "'It is I who have been defending
a religion called Judaism': the T.S. Eliot and Horace M. Kallen
Correspondence" , I have grown even more convinced that Eliot's
relation to both living Jews and Judaism as a cultural entity within
the West was far more complex than what Anthony Julius presents in
<i>T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism and Literary Form</i> .
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
At the time, I sought to challenge what I then regarded (and still do)
as Julius's tendentious and overdetermined insistence not only that
Eliot's strongest poetry is sustained by deep currents of anti-Semitism
but that he never recanted from the ideology apparently reflected in that
work. Though I admired many aspects of Julius's superb close readings
and appreciated his cogent exploration of the nexus of fascism and
literary modernism, I couldn't help but notice that Julius's argument
for a career based on an aesthetic of "energetic ill will" was based
on very early works such as "Sweeney," and "Burbank" (<i>EAL,</i>
138). By neglecting much of the poet's greater achievements, Julius
insisted that an anti-Semitic ethos was at the foundation of the most
important work. In spite of being deeply hurt by the cruel imagery as
a young reader of Eliot's early poetry, I have long been impressed by
the critical arguments championed by Peter Ackroyd and others that the
poet's conversion to Anglicanism engendered a significant break with
his anti-Semitic animus.
<p>
Though long suspecting that Eliot was something more than an unrepentant
fascist and anti-Semite, I had always found the evidence of this debate
(on either side) a bit thin. Imagine my surprise when just a few weeks
after laying Julius's book aside,

<b></b>

while conducting research on American Zionism at the American Jewish
Archives in Cincinnati, I discovered the yellowed but well-preserved
sheets of correspondence between T.S. Eliot and Horace M. Kallen,
a Jewish American philosopher, sociologist, and Zionist polemicist
who was a prolific and widely read author; these pages quite literally
spilled onto my lap. It was an eerie experience to realize I held in my
hands the original documents, and it obviously took quite a bit longer to
determine what it all added up to. In many ways, I have been reflecting
on that moment ever since.
<p>
By the end of the day, I knew I was studying documents that (especially
in the enduring absence of any published correspondence after the year
1922) had the potential for greatly raising the stakes and enhancing the
scope of the often shrill debate over Eliot's anti-Semitism, to which
Julius was only the most recent contributor. Over the next few days, I
noted that the correspondence, which extended from 1927 (and according to
Ronald Schuchard there are probably missing letters from much earlier)
through at least 1960, encompassed two exciting threads. Besides the
fact that the letters reveal the evolution of Eliot's surprisingly
nuanced thinking about cultural difference and multiculturalism in the
post-Holocaust years, they also contain a lively exchange about the
role of secularism in American culture. These are the issues that form
the previously unknown and exciting parameters of what Eliot actually
thought about the subject of diversity&#8212;and the position of Jews
in Western culture.
<p>
Perhaps I should begin with the implications of the most charged phrase
of what was often a lively debate, when Eliot candidly concluded after
many years of engaging with Kallen's thought that: "It is I who have
been defending a religion called Judaism." Just what did Eliot mean by
that unlikely formulation? To understand that, we need to come to terms
with his interlocutor's own struggle to define the relevance of Jewish
civilization to modernity. Born in 1882 in Berenstadt, a village in the
German province of Silesia, Kallen arrived in the United States at the age
of five when his father became the rabbi of an Orthodox congregation in
Boston. For years the father and the secular-leaning son were estranged
and at Harvard, Kallen formed paternal attachments to men such as George
Santayana, Barrett Wendell, and William James. While an entering freshman,
Kallen's feelings toward Judaism and his own Jewishness were largely
negative; however, James influenced him to think about the problem of
difference in culture and Wendell encouraged him to think about the
powerful currents of Hebraic elements in American literary, political,
and social thought. Although Kallen remained antagonistic toward the
Jewish religion, he spent decades as a committed advocate for an ethnic
identity based on Jewish secularism, Zionism, and Jewish culture.
<p>
It may startle many readers to know that by 1915 Kallen had already
coined the term "cultural pluralism" as a direct challenge to both
nativism and the prevailing paradigm of the melting pot ethos, blazing
the trail for the charged cultural debates of the late twentieth century
and beyond. For Kallen, American society was to be bound together in an
"orchestration" (a key Kallen trope) of difference, a vibrant federation
of ethnic groups. He seems to have arrived at this point in "Judaism,
Hebraism, Zionism," a 1932 essay, through thinking about how the long
ages of Jewish marginality might contribute to a dynamic way of thinking
about American democracy:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Culture . . . constitutes a harmony, of which peoples and nations are
the producing instruments, to which each contributes its unique tone,
in which the whole human past is present as an enduring tension, as a
background from which the present comes to light and draws its character,
color, vitality.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A decade later he had refined the idea with sufficient lucidity to
demonstrate that the proliferation of diversities within America which
troubled so many was actually the mortar that would cement the nation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The American way of life may be said to flow from each man's inalienable
right to be different. . . . The consummation is Cultural Pluralism. For
its diverse and ever-diversifying members are united with one another
in and through their differences, and the singularity of our culture
is the orchestration of those manifold differences&#8212;e pluribus
unum&#8212;into the common faith.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Kallen's liberal reading of the motto "e pluribus unum" boldly
asserts the necessity of including the hyphenated individual in the
American union. As Stephen Whitfield observes, in this legitimization of
ethnic difference, "the individual could be anchored in a continuous
and comforting fabric of institutions that enriched the larger
community. Kallen was the pioneer theorist of resistance to the ideal
of homogenization."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
It has often been remarked that every anti-Semite has his pet
Jew. Over the years, the venomous Pound (whose unquestionably political
anti-Semitism I would never deny) cultivated a number of individual
literary Jews, from Louis Zukofskyto Allen Ginsberg, especially those
he felt had in some way repudiated or radically distanced themselves
from their Judaism. But this is certainly not the case with Eliot, as
Ronald Schuchard recently demonstrated in these pages, drawing from my
own earlier analysis. There is no more compelling instance of Eliot's
compassionate humanism than the evidence these letters contain of
Eliot's concern for Jewish refugees and his activism on their behalf
(which included meetings with Jewish philanthropists) during World
War II. In later years, though he was often severely challenged by
Kallen's radical secularism&#8212;as when the latter sent Eliot a
copy of his 1954 tome <i>Secularism is the Will of God: An Essay in
the Social Philosophy of Democracy and Religion</i>&#8212;the tone of
the correspondence remains highly collegial as if the two were engaged
on a journey of mutual inquiry. For instance, in response to Kallen's
statement that "It is the will of God that religion and ecclesiastical
affairs should not enter into the functions of the state, especially
into Public education," Eliot responded by asking "what meaning"
Kallen attached to "God" (18 March 1955). Less than two weeks later,
musing on the conflict between sharply conflicting belief systems in a
modern democracy, he gently remarked that "the line dividing tolerance
from indifference, and the line dividing faith from bigotry, may be so
fine as to be almost invisible" (2 April 1955). But Eliot was also an
admirer of the Jewish American's <i>The Book of Job as a Greek Tragedy</i>
where Kallen argued that "God" was little more than "the social soul of
which the institutions of society&#8212;economic, political, aesthetic
and ritual&#8212;are the body. As psychologists know, for every change
in the body there is a corresponding alteration of

<b></b>

soul. The idea of divinity therefore has a history which may be considered
as a function of the history of the society that entertains the idea."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
It is clear that both men were painstakingly articulating their beliefs in
relation to the genocide and destruction of the previous decade. Hence,
in Kallen's thinking, the secular contract was a "sacred" guarantee of
peace and tolerance between divergent religious groups, and he once told
Eliot that "the chief point of divergence between us is that while I
acquiesce in the right of others to their supernaturalism, I do not give
it a privileged position" (10 November 1955). Secularism would prevent any
one religion from oppressing minority faiths. For his part, Eliot never
lost an opportunity to stress the role of religion in culture, even as he
distanced himself from his once monolithic espousal of Christianity. In
a letter written in November 1955, he argues against Kallen's model of
ethnicity or race to affirm religion's primacy in civilization: "what I
call culture seems to me more important than race. . . . A culture can,
to all appearance, survive for some time the religion without which it
would not have arisen: but I do not believe that it can continue forever
if the religion dies."
<p>
On Christmas day in 1955, Eliot wrote to Kallen in America,
expressing his eagerness to get hold of a copy of Will Herberg's
<i>Protestant-Catholic-Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology,</i>
a pioneering work that articulated what then appeared as a bold
affirmation of pluralism by arguing for an "American Religion"
based on the fundamental subdivisions of Judaism, Protestantism,
and Catholicism. Eliot admired the Jewish writer's attention to the
"plight" of modern secular humanity; namely the paradox that postwar
America was at once intensely materialistic and engaged in a national
religious revival dependent on its "triple melting pot" and even seems
to have drawn from Herberg's sense that a political culture devoid of
religious beliefs and institutions presented an existential threat to
Jewish life in his incessant debates with Kallen.
<p>
In his later years, Eliot (notorious for severing long-term relationships
on the pretext of the merest perceived slights), whose enduring friendship
with Kallen included social and professional visits to the latter's New
School, seemed to have grown increasingly anxious about offending Jews
who increasingly sought to engage him in epistolary dialogue, and he
often recounted his exchanges with strangers to Kallen. On more than one
occasion in the mid-1950s he states his fervent desire that the "Jewish
faith survive," and in the shadowy aftermath of the European barbarity, he
wrote to one Dr. Harry Cohen, "I believe that the contribution which Jews
have made in the Western world has been, in modern times, in proportion
to the degree of development of the culture of the country in which Jews
are found . . . the more developed the civilization of a country, the
larger has been the Jewish contribution" (10 November 1955). The point,
of course, is not whether this was a staggeringly original observation
(it wasn't), but rather, Eliot's comment reveals not only that he had
clearly reached a point where he thought tensions between Jews and
Christians were damaging to civilization as a whole but also that he
affirmed a unique role for Judaism as a dynamic faith bestowing its
wisdom to the West. Precisely because of this conviction he remained
opposed to what he saw as Kallen's reductive advocacy of the ephemera
of Jewish culture, so that

<b></b>

at a typical impasse he declared to the Jewish psychologist, "You know it
seems to me that you have been defending a religion called the American
Idea and that it is I who am defending a religion called Judaism"
(2 April 1955)&#8212;a point that Kallen never contested. But the
minutiae of these exchanges is not nearly as important as the evidence
they provide for what has long been an attractive, if not sufficiently
substantiated, sense among many critics that throughout the 1950s Eliot
was making progress in shifting from a once-cherished ideal of cultural
homogeneity toward the kind of diversity espoused decades earlier
by his teachers William James and John Dewey. Richard Shusterman is
representative of this argument which began to emerge in the late 1980s,
observing that Eliot came to recognize that "diversity and disagreement
are not necessarily evils that must be overcome. They can provide a more
satisfying variety and richness of experience, and can moreover serve
as a productive tension to stimulate thought and progress."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p align="center">
* * *
<p>
Interestingly, the rabbis, of various denominations, with whom I have
shared these findings, have concurred with Eliot that the uncritical
embrace of "ethnicity" has only exacerbated the unmooring of Jews from
their religion. Kallen had spent so many years advocating a secular
Zionism that he grew to be callously dismissive of both Reform and
Orthodox belief.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
In the present moment, "ethnicity" (even when it is wedded to a
political ideology like Zionism) seems a fragile vessel to contain the
rich totality of the Jewish prophetic tradition. As Stephen Whitfield
observes, in the early generations of Jewish American culture,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the associational patterns, the bonds of intimacy in workplace and
neighborhood, the direct links to the Old World&#8212;all were strong
enough to honor the claims of ethnicity, in the absence of religion. . . secure enough to keep intact a community from which a culture
could emerge. By the end of the century, however, that identity has
destabilized, so that the boundaries between Jews and others have mostly
been obliterated.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
When one imagines the fate of an American Judaism without the vicarious
anchors of Zionism and the Holocaust, Eliot's long view of the more
sustaining values of religious life seems compellingly prescient.
<p>
Eight years after first encountering this startling correspondence, I
remain impressed by both the duration and affectionate nature of Eliot
and Kallen's unusual friendship. To encounter Eliot's writing lengthy
letters to his Jewish friend, even on Christmas day, and more often
than not signed "affectionately"; or Kallen's concluding of his with
Hebrew inscriptions such as <i>Shalom u'vracha</i> ("Peace and Blessings
Upon You") and, during one of Eliot's late illnesses, <i>Hazak</i>
(God's command to Joshua, "Strengthen Thyself") is to witness striking
evidence of their bond. But I am more impressed by what the letters tell
us about the transformation of the writer who, in the infamous <i>After
Strange Gods</i> (later condemned by the poet himself as the work of
"a very sick man" [1934]), had denounced "free-thinking Jews." Eliot's
refusal to be ingratiating is

<b></b>

perhaps the greatest evidence of his sincere engagement with Kallen's
Jewish identity. Like Julius and many others, I deeply regret that Eliot
never took a public opportunity to clarify matters or to repudiate what
some rightly regard as deeply wounding imagery. I have not been arguing
that these letters provide definitive proof of anything more than that
Eliot had a more inquiring and receptive mind than his most hostile
critics seem willing to acknowledge, and that he grew to be quite at ease
in accepting the likely prospect of enduring cultural differences. But
it remains quite possible that one day something odious will spill onto
someone else's lap in a musty archive that will overturn much of what I
have been arguing. In this regard, I will confess to feeling particularly
uneasy about Valerie Eliot's apparent reluctance to publish any of her
husband's correspondence. She has been coldly indifferent to the urgent
pleas for access to this material made by numerous Eliot scholars who
have dedicated long careers to creating a more complete portrait of the
poet's intellectual life, and one has to wonder why. For many long months,
she refused me permission to publish any portion of what I had discovered,
even though I demonstrated to her just how favorable the contents of the
Eliot-Kallen correspondence was to her husband's legacy. (I only received
permission to quote directly after the enthusiastic intercession of the
poet Seamus Heaney who immediately recognized the value of the letters
and graciously prevailed on his contacts at Faber and Faber.) Still, the
letters tell me this at the very least; that throughout his adult life,
Eliot was a thoughtful and sensitive correspondent with a Jewish-American
intellectual who held pronouncedly different views and that he was
a modest enough man to allow the latter's thoughts to enlarge his
own. These letters offer eloquent testimony to the evolution of the
poet's consciousness and his apparent determination to come to terms
with Jews&#8212;and Judaism as a living tradition.

Struggling to articulate a solid, poised identity out of the centuries of
fragmentation and exile, Kallen consistently argued that Reform Judaism
was too "detached from Jewish life," whereas traditional faith was overly
reliant on "a supernaturalism [that] cannot maintain itself against a
practical intelligence which wrests her secrets from nature." Advocating
"Hebraism" over the "Judaistic" religion, he insisted that the latter must
be replaced with the "animating ideal" of Zionism which would reintegrate
secular, cultural, and communal forms. See <i>Judaism at Bay,</i> 74, 77.

The Idea of a Jewish Society

<p>
In the Gregorian year 2000, Rosh Hashanah dinners were politically
intense in Jerusalem. An unwelcome visit to Muslim shrines by Ariel
Sharon (then leader of the Knesset opposition) was followed, only hours
before the festival began, by violence. At the time, I was finishing my
first year as a citizen of Israel and was taken aback to find a member
of Ehud Barak's government, a re of international prestige, at the
New Year's dinner I was attending. I naturally hoped the minister could
tell us things we had not heard on the news and that he could offer a
sense of what the government might have in mind to do. But the minister
had questions of his own. Is it not true, he asked, that those elected
to parliament in Scandinavian countries are required even today to
swear allegiance to the state and the state church? Why could not Arabs
elected to the Knesset be required to swear allegiance to Israel as a
specifically Jewish state? The minister feared development, not only of
an Arab fifth column in Muslim/Christian areas of Israel like the Galilee,
but also a pro-Palestinian bloc in the Knesset. I do not remember at this
distance how much history the minister was offered that evening, but I
did not say aloud what I was thinking. It was the oath of allegiance to
the Established Church that had kept elected Jews (Lionel de Rothschild,
notably) from sitting in the House of Commons for much of the Victorian
era, and here was a member of the Jewish state parliament wondering
aloud whether Jews should not demand a likewise impossible oath of Arab
Muslims and Arab Christians. So far as I know, the minister in the end
proposed no such oath to the cabinet. But the fact of his raising its
possibility&#8212;even under pressure of High Holy Day violence in the
Holy City&#8212;had me thinking about . . . T. S. Eliot.

<b></b>

<p>
Or rather, I was thinking about the ironies of history and naming them, as
a shorthand, T. S. Eliot. For here was a state founded by free-thinking
Jews for free-thinking Jews. Its founders had not conceived it as a
place even for religious Jews, though accommodations were made for
them; and certainly not as a place for non-Jews. A Jewish state was,
even the Soviets agreed, an obligation after Auschwitz. No gentile
state&#8212;given history&#8212;could trust itself to guarantee Jews
so much as a right to breathe. So like Aeneas and his band, returning
from a Troy in ruins to an Italy the goddess Venus said they came from,
Zionists and refugees with no obvious place to go arrived at a piece of
land they did not want to know was inhabited. "Now what?" has been the
question ever since.
<p>
Whether Israel is a real democracy is not the issue. (A columnist in
<i>Haaretz,</i> the most distinguished Israeli newspaper, wrote recently
of the prime minister: "Sharon, the man with the balls of steel, has the
leadership vision of a blind goat.") At issue is a problem more Eliotic:
At what point does diversity begin to attenuate identity? Can a Jewish
state, in other words, be both free-thinking (inclusive, pluralist,
liberal, secular) and meaningfully Jewish? The answer that Israeli
governments have consistently supplied or implied since 1948 has been
Eliotic as well. I would go so far as to suggest that Israel may be the
country that most fully embodies what Eliot hoped the modern world might
be and, moreover, the culture in which the word <i>modern</i> appears to
mean most nearly what he meant by it. Israel offers something like the
mix of homogeneity and "friction" (the population is more than eighty
percent Jewish, but the Jews split into mutually disdaining factions)
that Eliot argued will characterize any flourishing culture.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
The continual outcry from Sephardim, including politically powerful
Sephardim, against the undue influence of the Ashkenazi elite testifies
to Israel's having the kind of "graded society" that Eliot consistently
favored (and continued to advocate even after he endorsed democracy in
the wake of World War II).
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Eliot never argued for theocracy and Israel is not one, but the rabbinate
is a cultural and political force here (the Sephardi and Ashkenazi
chief rabbis are employed by the government; synagogues and yeshivas are
subsidized by secular taxpayers; large numbers of yeshiva students are
exempt from military service). The Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties,
which have ministers in every cabinet, ensure that aspects of Jewish
law are enforced (however haphazardly) by the state.
<p>
It is said that the large secular parties, left and right, are held
ransom by their needing Knesset votes from small religious parties to
form governments, but the details are more complex&#8212;and complex
in ways that Eliot might have appreciated. Beginning with the founders
of the state, secular Jews have been unable to find ways of asserting
the Jewish identity of Israel without reference to religious tradition,
and they have sometimes viewed the state in messianic terms. Even without
rabbinic pressure, the secular majority might insist that public education
include Jewish religious content, and it seems that nonreligious Jews
are as opposed to permitting Christian proselytization&#8212;it is
forbidden by law in Israel&#8212;as is the rabbinate itself. Secular
Jews are pleased, in my experience here, when their beliefs are seen
to coincide with Jewish religious tenets (Israeli vegetarian literature
presents as prescient the rabbinic

<b></b>

and biblical concern with animal welfare). I have seen nonreligious
Jews exhibit contempt at the ultra-Orthodox refusal to recite
hallelujah psalms on Israel Independence Day; and the irony goes,
ironically, unnoticed. Some of Eliot's best polemic concerned the piety
of atheists. He was touched by the Christian simplicity of Bertrand
Russell's belief in gentleness ("St. Augustine did not believe more")
and made likewise rude remarks about Joyce, Nietzsche, Baudelaire,
Voltaire, and other post- or anti-Christians.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
In Israel, an equivalent polemic would have no point. The relation
between the nouns <i>Jew</i> and <i>Israel</i> is more like the relation
between <i>Christian</i> and <i>Christendom</i> than like that between
<i>Christian</i> and <i>Europe.</i> The title of Eliot's essay "Why
Mr. Russell Is a Christian" was a clever provocation. An Israeli version
("Why Mr. Grossman Is a Jew") would be neither clever nor provocative;
it would be otiose or inane.
<p>
As for myself, let me add immediately, the mix of homogeneity and
friction in my new home is uncomfortable. I have learned in my almost five
years here that I am more American&#8212;more Californian&#8212;than I
suspected, that diversity (and divergence from norms, any norm) are for
me, simply, needs. The argument made by communitarians, against thinkers
like Habermas, that liberal culture is too "thin" to sustain worthwhile
communal life is an argument less easy to make if you have lived with
real cultural thickness. In practice, a "thick" culture is one composed
of neighbors&#8212;people who regard themselves as family, with a right
to disapprove (emphatically, if sweetly) the degree and sort of your
conformity to convention. I have yet to attend a wedding, funeral, or
circumcision in Jerusalem at which a well-meaning friend or colleague
has not questioned some aspect of my comportment or the clothes that I
have chosen to wear. The poet who could formulate the phrase "menace and
caress" (<i>The Dry Salvages</i> I: 31) would know with some exactitude
the feelings that are, on such occasions, stirred. I wonder, in fact,
how much Eliot, who is said to have worn green pancake makeup to London
dinner parties to achieve who-knows-what effect, would have suffered under
a Christian and communitarian order of the kind he claimed to desire. I
suspect he would have taken to reading Bakunin or Tzara and hung up the
bowler hat. I suspect, also, that the debate between communitarians and
pluralists has gotten nowhere in the United States because everyone on
both sides is ambivalent. As Eliot said, there is no culture that can
satisfy all human needs simultaneously.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
(I spend a lot of time on airplanes.)
<p>
Identity is not the only human need. But identification with established
groups seems, increasingly (and in my view, for the worse), to be among
our primary desires. There is no sense my rehearsing recent history in the
Balkans, Rwanda, Congo, the former Soviet republics, the Islamic world,
and almost everywhere else&#8212;identity is not only not dissipating
as a need, it is reasserting itself with a vengeance. Carl Schmitt,
on the far German right, held that "people can only be unified against
other people," and the reflex is to reply: then let them not be unified.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
The attempt to liberate Western thought from its tendency toward
either/or exclusiveness is a postmodern project I esteem. In its service,
I would not mind abandoning traits of communal identity (and thus unity),
even were the result what Eliot called "thin soup."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
(Consomm&eacute; has, after all, its uses.) The trouble is that the
process of self-dilution seems not to affect the

<b></b>

need for enmity&#8212;the enmity that underwrites identity&#8212;on the
part of others. The final dissolution of an adversary's identity may be
aggressively pursued.
<p>
An implication of <i>The Tradition of Return,</i> the first book I
wrote about modernism, was that an obsessional desire for return to less
diluted states of a culture can follow on its aggressive liberalization.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Some modernists, like Eliot, felt that an effort was required to
bring about such a return in the West; others, like the author of
<i>Ulysses,</i> felt the return had come to pass autonomically. In either
case, "the way forward" was thought to be "the way back"&#8212;and
<i>modern</i> meant, for this sort of modernist, a renascence of the
renaissance of antiquity.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
I warned, in concluding that book, that liberalization or dilution
may draw an equal and opposite reaction; Heidegger and Pound felt
that armed force was required to set matters back on track. Zionism,
like the paleomodernism with which it was contemporary, defined itself
as in much the modernist sense revivalist. Official Israel remains
obsessed with <i>nostos</i>&#8212;Hebrew place names are restored (or
made up), biblical sites are excavated and glorified (at the expense of
less ancient ruins: "Roman <i>tchotchkes,</i>" as a colleague refers
to them). I live in a neighborhood of Jerusalem called the Greek
Colony. From the window as I write I can see the Greek consulate,
an International Style-cum-Deco structure in a neck of town rich in
Bauhaus architecture. Some Bauhaus architects escaped the Nazis and
did remarkable work in Jerusalem and especially Tel Aviv. The local
classicism is Judeo-modernist and distinctly post-refugee. Wet laundry
hangs from gracefully off-center windows, or along elegantly curved
banisters; potted geraniums and ivy obstruct cubist stairways. And the
effect belies the image of modernist classicism as unlivable and cold,
unlovable, and hard. Postmodernist architecture has made scant headway
in Israel because the modernist buildings have been made (in the Yiddish
sense) <i>heimisch.</i> It is not for nothing that so many academics
averse to modernism are also averse to Israel. My own sense is that
Israel is disliked more as a modernist state by postmoderns than as a
Jewish state by anti-Semites.
<p>
The modernist desire for return to a prior, less diluted state of culture
involved displacements and, as Eliot came to acknowledge, injustices.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Injustice to middles&#8212;to what comes between distant pasts and
revolutionary returns&#8212;is endemic to the process. Eliot confessed
in postwar essays to having written, earlier in his career, unjust
accounts of the Romantics, Milton, even Shakespeare: he explained
that he had thought their canonization, alongside Homer, Vergil,
Dante, would produce a taste for consomm&eacute;. Behind the culinary
metaphor was a philosophical argument about which I have written at
length elsewhere, an argument that&#8212;if applied to culture and,
moreso, politics&#8212;can motivate an exclusionary urge.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
The philosophy is radical, but its social consequence reactionary:
"since reality is conventional, and truth determined by conventions of
language&#8212;it was necessary to maintain a rigorous and exclusive
vocabulary in order to have truth or reality at all." The problem with
adding terms from one vocabulary&#8212;one rival vocabulary&#8212;to
another is that doing so "threatens the continuity and even the existence
of reality."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Pluralists now act as if this argument had never been raised or
as if it has by this time been transcended, though versions of it
continue to be made and applied by pragmatists like Stanley Fish,
some Wittgensteinians, and

<b></b>

most Kuhnians. Our pretending that the problem is behind us, or has no
implications for war and peace, has left Sharon, Arafat, and Bush to
answer philosophical questions that have defeated, not only Eliot, but,
in my view, Wittgenstein, Kuhn, and pragmatism as well.
<p>
There is urgent, incomplete work to pursue, and intellectuals defer
responsibility by quarreling with each other, ad hominem and to no
result. The urgent question Eliot failed to answer ("unity and diversity,"
he named it) may be over our heads as well, but perhaps not if we begin
by confessing bewilderment. Intellectuals outside the academy are better
at honesty than we are intramurally (they are not paid, as academics are,
to hold ground and till fields). Solzhenitsyn, for example, by reputation
an anti-Semite, has published a study of Russian-Jewish relations in which
he takes the stance: I want a genuine conversation, a reconciliation,
with Jews before I die. The response outside Russia had been minimal to
Solzhenitsyn's first volume, so I arranged to have two chapters translated
into English and published in <i>Common Knowledge</i>&#8212;the journal
I set up to stare enmity (not enemies) down.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
I find Solzhenitsyn's critique of Russian Jewry (my maternal family is
from Russia) stimulating. But I am not optimistic that the international
dialogue Solzhenitsyn wants, given the glory to be won in battle with
him, will not become an opportunity for recrimination. Still, here and
there, mostly within walking distance of where I now live, there are
groups of Christians and Jews, Muslims and Jews, Muslims, Christians,
and Jews, who pursue honest discussions they hope may lead, eventually,
to edifying conclusions. The relationships among the monotheisms and
their proponents are intricate and troubled, have been radioactive
for centuries, and demand a sustained attention that neither secular
nor religious thinkers have shown them until recently. The Vatican
Curia came, it appears, to this conclusion first. The Catholic Church,
since the death of Pius XII, has abandoned supersessionism, affirmed the
Jewish covenant as irrevocable, and sought a serious exchange with Jews
(and more lately, Muslims) at the level where incommensurability seems
to lurk: theology. But Rome has met with no equivalent response.
<p>
As for the academic community, I am aware of numerous, quietly productive
connections maintained between Western (Christian, Jewish, secular)
and Muslim scholars. But the boldest recent development, and improbably
the most promising, is the appearance of Edward Said's <i>Freud and
the Non-European.</i>
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
There, a myth contrived by a Jew (the most famous free thinker in
the era of <i>After Strange Gods</i>) is deployed in the service of
fusing horizons&#8212;Jewish with Arab horizons. Said's book imagines
a shared Middle Eastern milieu that dates back before either Judaism
per se or Islam. <i>Moses and Monotheism</i> is perhaps not the best
place to begin the dialogue, that process of fusion; though the choice
of Freud, a kind of Zionist, a trustee of the Hebrew University,
as chief fuser makes an agreeable irony. It is Said's method that
inspires hope. His looking to modern hermeneutic principles to resolve
a dilemma that others would solve by imposing pluralism, forcefully,
on the whole Middle East is a step in the direction of health. Rival
milieus&#8212;coherent vocabularies closed (to quote Eliot quoting
Bradley) on the outside&#8212;can be immiscible or even incommensurable:
their continuity or even contiguity requires the establishment of a
credibly shared history.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<b></b>

Hence Said's appreciation of Freud's myth of Moses the Egyptian learning
monotheism at the pharaonic court. But hence, also, the story's inutility
(it has at best the status of midrash). As George Steiner says, Freud's
was a myth aimed to remove a "lightning-rod" from the Jews before the
Nazis could strike them for burdening mankind with monotheism.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Said could have achieved the desired result, however, with recourse
to no text but the Hebrew Bible. He could have explored in detail
passages in the Torah where non-Israelite precedents of Israelite
religion are acknowledged explicitly (Gen. 14:18-20, Exod. 18:9-27,
Num. 22:8-24:25). The least dubious, the most believable, route to
a shared milieu would be the obvious one: Islam and Christianity each
developed, historically, with reference to Judaism; and the rabbinate, as
I suggested recently in <i>Common Knowledge,</i> could come to recognize
them both as "Israelite monotheisms."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
The Christian church has from early days referred to itself as
Israel. Instead of blaming the church for appropriating that birthright,
Jews could acknowledge and take pride that traditions of intelligence
and splendor, Christianity and Islam, have adapted Hebrew Scripture and
spread versions of its morality throughout the world. But an ecumenical
theology so inclusively grand entails a rhetoric for which there is no
respectable audience. Though ours is said to be a time of globalization
economically, it is intellectually (and on the whole, culturally)
the heyday of "local knowledge."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
It would be too much to claim, therefore, that Ishmael has embraced the
faith of Isaac, and Esau the faith of Jacob. It would be utopian to say
(as I would frankly like to say) that the peoples now resident in the
Holy Land are all Israelites, in some unthinkably wide sense, and belong
together here. But this much I believe we can say, and reading Eliot
can help us to say it: What we have on this stage of history is a family
reunion&#8212;thus far a tragedy. Aunt Agatha has not made an appearance,
and no one else knows how the Furies are transformed into Kindly Ones.
<p>
<i>The Family Reunion</i> failed, Eliot conceded, because he had tried,
in writing it, to reconcile ("adjust" was his verb) too much heterogeneous
material: "I cannot make it cohere," Pound likewise confessed, meaning
not just his <i>Cantos</i> but the world.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Oddly, Eliot's failure stemmed from his rejection of a foundational
Christian principle, and he rejected it on explicitly Pharisaic
grounds. Within a year of his reception into the Anglican Church, he
dared write: "The spirit killeth, but the letter giveth life"&#8212;an
inversion of St. Paul's inversion of Judaism.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Despite the implied philo-Semitism, Eliot's remark (directed against
those who saw liberalism as the spirit of Christianity) was a step toward
his conclusion about free-thinking Jews. Paul's subordination of letter
to spirit made the Judaic components of Christianity&#8212;Judaism shorn
of most law and custom&#8212;assimilable by gentiles. The preference
for specific detail over spirit, significance, or abstracted value
is proverbially Jewish (anti-Semites call it "particularism"), but
when that preference is taken up by gentiles, it is exclusionist with
respect to Jews. (Solzhenitsyn's critique of Russian Jewry hinges on
the attendant ironies.)
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Today, however, Jews constitute a majority in their own nation-state,
and the Arab minority in Israel neither wants assimilation nor is
being offered a full chance. The situation here is by no means unusual
internationally (and has taken more violent forms in southern

<b></b>

Europe and central Africa). Even if the Palestinian right of return (to
Israel proper) is abjured, a million of Israel's citizens will still be
Arabs. Peace will depend, here as in most places, on the reconciliation
rather than the separation of hostile groups.
<p>
A means of reconciliation ("conflict resolution" is no substitute)
is not now in serious development. A means that could be
developed&#8212;it is still on the books&#8212;is the one associated
with St. Paul. Multicultural fusions and ecosystems become thinkable when
the spirit of culturally specific beliefs and practices is extracted and
credited, then matched up with the gist of other cultures. Universalism,
Pauline or otherwise, runs against the grain of recent thinking,
which takes it as naive and thus laughable, or as imperialist and thus
oppressive. But critics of the argument for local knowledge have a point
in faulting contextualists for lending aid and comfort to Balkanization.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Both contextualism and universalism have had ill effects in
practice. Pluralism, which seems to combine these two approaches to
diversity, succeeds only in some places or only for so long. A Fourth
Way, however, may be inchoate. Theoretical work on the ambivalence
that persists within closed contexts, and historical work that shows
how permeable the closure of such contexts is and always was, have
brought us closer to solving the problems Eliot raised; though still
not close enough. The defense of pluralism against its adversaries,
against the dead by polemical means and the living by force of arms, is a
distraction. The job that most needs doing now is commensuration&#8212;of
alien contexts, discourses, cultures.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
And that job will be accomplished solely, if at all, by the process
(to quote Eliot one last time) of "quiet co-operative labour."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

and no one conflict, envy or fear will dominate. . . . The universality
of irritation is the best assurance of peace" (132-3). On conditions for

play off against other gods and thus win open spaces for their own aims,
is 'the most monstrous of all human errors'. . . . In his late work,
<i>Moses and Monotheism,</i> Freud ascribed the commission of this 'error'
to an Egyptian prince and seer of the scattered house of Ikhnaton. Many
have wondered why [Freud] should have sought to shift from his own
people that supreme weight of glory. . . . He was trying to wrench the
lightning-rod out of the hands of the Jewish people. It was too late. The
leprosy of God's choice&#8212;but who chose whom?&#8212;was too visible
on them" (37, 39).

camera eye (the limitation, the original liar); yet lyre sings to the
mind so immediately (the exalted selectivity, one wants to forget that
its string can so easily make puppetry of human motivation)."

<p>
Just what is it that makes Rosenquist's paintings from the 1960s look so
contemporary, so appealing? The artist himself claimed a look of nostalgia
for the objects he depicted, such as fifties Fords and Franco-American
spaghetti, whose industrial orange aura served as his Proustian madeleine:
"I felt it as a remembrance of things."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
It is only with the passage of time, in the aftermath of the 1980s
commodity and media deconstructivists (Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger),
and some-time pornographers (Jeff Koons and David Salle), that we can
see the prescience

<b></b>

of his take on mass culture in the late modern period. Like his
contemporary Gerhard Richter, Rosenquist appropriates readymade
photographs and brushes them back into paint, exposing the limits of
the camera by literally blurring the truth of what it sees. From the
surface of Richter's low- definition grisailles hovers the anemic memory
of post-World War II Germany. By contrast, Rosenquist's rainbow-sherbet
vision is firmly cast on the 1950s American landscape emptied out by
the overabundance of things. It trades in the currency of appearances
manufactured by the camera&#8212;the "bordello without walls"&#8212;in
the promiscuity of advertising and the selling of self image.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist's pictorial essays on media sex, lies, and history parallel
the prophetic writings of Marshall McLuhan, whose influence has similarly
been neglected by the art history academy and recent artists alike. Since
the 1980s, media critics have appropriated Frankfurt School theories
of the dehumanizing "culture industry" or the dystopic "simulacrum"
of French post-structuralists.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
McLuhan, like Rosenquist, avoids the value judgments of European
literati, with their understandably elitist reactions of despair and
cynicism. Instead, these two North American pragmatists explore the
fascination and inevitability of the mass media with critical awareness.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
They share the same technique of paradoxical juxtaposition (aphorisms
and collage) punctuated by erudite references (James Joyce and
Marcel Duchamp) as survival strategies against the numbing forces of
technology. Both gleefully subvert the vulgarity and the clich&eacute;
mentality promoted by advertising copy. Non-sequential splicing
of text and canvas ruptures otherwise seamless perception; passive
thinking erupts with racing thoughts and phrases uttered tongue in
cheek. <i>"</i>Look Alive" one of Rosenquist's titles prescribes.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
One of his pervasive verbal visual puns, (based on advertising
slogans and military jargon), it alludes to the function of his
paintings. <i>Look alive</i>: hurry up, look lively, revivify your
vision, dulled by the relentless onslaught of images. See through
appearances and make the metaphorical leaps if you want to get with
the picture.
<p>
In the numerous references to art history that pop up in Rosenquist's
oeuvre, none is more revealing than <i>Sightseeing</i> of 1962. An
homage to Marcel Duchamp, in both the spirit and the letter, it depicts
a cropped view of the word fully registered by the title. The letters
on top, partially readable as "SIGHT" are filled in with the artist's
self-referential rose motif (Rose for Rosenquist). Underneath, the letters
"EE<i>"</i> (following "S") are framed in wood as a picture within a
picture. They block full visual access to cracked glass underneath&#8212;a
clear reference to Duchamp's iconic <i>The Bride Stripped Bare by Her
Bachelors, Even (1915-23) ,</i> also known as <i>The Large Glass .</i>
Sightseeing is a modern phenomenon of speed and mass tourism&#8212;a
view through the small glass of the camera&#8212;which paradoxically
blinds one's real understanding of another culture. But Rosenquist, like
Duchamp, is also a master punster, playing off literal and rative
meanings. Sightseeing: to see sight, to focus on vision, to see twice,
a double take, to have insight.
<p>
Zooming in on seeing, Rosenquist aligns himself with the on-going game
of perception, not the end game legacy of Duchamp's readymade (a legacy
inherited by Andy Warhol). Rosenquist continues to expose the voyeurism
and the violence of the gaze,

<b></b>

but now as it is specifically perpetrated by mechanical and electronic
means. The predatory and phallic fantasy of professionals taking pictures,
writes Susan Sontag, "is named without subtlety whenever we talk about
'loading' and 'aiming' a camera, about 'shooting' a film."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In one of his most unnerving constructions, <i>Bedspring</i> Rosenquist
ties the fragment of a women's face (painted on canvas and based on
photographic reproduction) to the edges of a bed frame, implying a
sadistic binding and stretching of the female body. The "coils" and
"frame" are twine and wood, painted to resemble metal. Bed is what
springs to mind when a man sees a "looker" (slang for a good-looking
woman). Yet as viewers of the work we are disoriented by the off-center
composition of the facial fragment and left with the disturbing
contemplation of a disembodied eye that springs back at us with the force
of our own gaze. That a painting stretcher (see the frame's corner keys)
doubles as the structure of a bed frame, implicates the scopophilia of
high art, as well as the camera, in the modern western tradition.
<p>
The Rose of Rosenquist is also a hybrid of Rrose Selavy ("Eros&#8212;that
<i>is</i> life"), Duchamp's female alter ego. And while sometimes a rose
is just a rose, Rosenquist's choice of self-representation confounds any
attempt to bifurcate his vision in sexist opposition. In the history of
art, Rosenquist's velvety flowers fall between the veiled symbolism of
Georgia O'Keeffe and the open celebrations of Judy Chicago. Who can look
at his lushly painted layers of deep red petals without carnal knowledge,
without recognizing the archetype of female sexuality (both innocence and
experience)? In <i>Sightseeing</i>, note the dark center of the rose,
pictured smack in the middle of the center of the letter "H" as in
"Hole". It is the only rose viewed straight on. Here we have another
form of sightseeing, that of the peep-hole, a particularly male view of
the female sex. Recalling Duchamp's metaphor of the hinge, Rosenquist's
paintings open onto, rather than close off, interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Rosenquist differs from Duchamp, however, in fundamental respects:
he returns painting to the eye and the craft, reinvesting the medium
of oil on canvas with sensuous force. And unlike the overtly cerebral,
secretive Duchamp, Rosenquist is a populist and a showman, the guileless
artist in the paper suit.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist remains understudied by comparison to the attention lavished on
Warhol and Lichtenstein (not to mention the proto-Poppers, Jasper Johns
and Robert Rauschenberg). The reasons are many. The major contributions
of queer and gender studies have played to the advantage of Warhol, and
secondarily to Lichtenstein, whose soft-spoken, reserved demeanor and
"artsy" subject matter gave off a tentative masculinity.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Rosenquist and his work, by contrast, exude a traditional male
heterosexuality energy. In scale and subject, he is "painting with two
balls," in an age where feminist approaches have indicted demeaning
representations of women as they have been constructed by the masculine
gaze.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Understandably, Rosenquist is sensitive to being misinterpreted over
the subject of sex in his images.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
But there it is, looming large. Mistakenly viewed as misogynist, his work
is actually a systematic exposure of gender stereotypes&#8212;feminine
<i>and</i> masculine&#8212;in advertising during the baby-boom era. In
Rosenquist's images of the 1960s, the Mechanical Bride is stripped bare,
as are the Bachelors of Madison Avenue, even.

<b></b>

<p>
Rosenquist also proves to be the exceptional re in a movement
usually characterized as cynical or politically non-committed. Warhol
and Lichtenstein appropriated readymade visuals and drew out their
banality through serial repetition and standardized techniques. Their
subtle alterations and ironic interjections served to distance, rather
than clarify, their personal stance, resulting in an ambiguous position
between complicity and critique.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Be it emotionless ennui, or camp melodrama, Pop, it is said repeatedly,
is all about surface. Yet Rosenquist's work has apparent depth,
especially in the fluid passages of monochrome that lull the eye into a
pleasurable stupor only to be jolted by equally illusionistic renderings
of shiny chrome and mouth-watering citrus. His anti-linear narratives,
based on shifting viewpoints and scale, interspersed with fragments of
seemingly unrelated but oft-repeated images, are oblique but not opaque.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Societal violence, the loss of identity, the ennui of suburbia,
are all messages not so subliminally imparted through the stylized
image relays of his painted medium. Rosenquist's interviews and
parlance&#8212;an aggregate of disjointed stories, a mix of earnestness
and dissembling, and passages of incoherence shot through with framed
exactitude&#8212;match the effects of his paintings. If Warhol and
Lichtenstein represent the cool attitude of Pop, Rosenquist is its
hot-blooded exemplar.
<p>
Rosenquist's work of the early 1960s carries profound messages about
America in the Cold War period, of the predicament of democracy when image
dominates over substance, the visual over the literate. Much has been made
of Rosenquist's training as a billboard artist, which was instrumental
in his insider knowledge of motivational research in the advertising
industry. But the scale and compositional devices of his work also point
to the influence of Mexican mural painting, with its compelling imagery
of churning machines and capitalist greed, and its pointed commentary on
American imperialism in Latin America. He is a history painter in an age
when rative art is discredited, when didacticism, not obscenity,
is taboo, and when the lie of the camera has rendered suspect all
higher moral ground. No cynic, Rosenquist has asserted his position on
gun control and his distrust of the military industrial complex. His
active protest against the Vietnam war is a matter of record, as is
his recent protest against military intervention in Iraq. His images
capture the history of his times, while acknowledging the changes in
historical consciousness wrought by incessant media coverage and the
leveling of difference between the trivial and the catastrophic. In his
own words, his seemingly garrulous images actually impugn "the power of
the commercial advertising which is in turn related to our free society,
the visual inflation which accompanies the money that produces box tops
and space cadets."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Born in 1933, to Depression era parents ("My parents never had any money"
he recalls) Rosenquist reached maturity in the years of unprecedented
American expansion and material wealth.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
He and his peers saw the collapse of New Deal Liberalism and the demise
of the Old Left during the McCarthy era of the 1950s. Rosenquist's
politics were formed in that moment between the dissident Beats and the
radical SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), between the Fifties
and the Sixties&#8212;the moment of the Left's "missing generation"
(<i>TS</i>, 22-30). The deliberate obsolescence and emptiness of the
objects he portrays evoke the sense of a time gone by, whose values

<b></b>

were irrevocably empty in any event. From a pivotal historical
perspective&#8212;the 1950s seen through the libertine revolt and
political disenchantment of the 1960s&#8212;Rosenquist dismantles
the American Dream with the finesse of one who has painted its
fa&ccedil;ade. Pervaded by anonymity and nostalgia, his imagery
triggers our awareness of the allegorical nature of his enterprise,
of meaning constructed out of the seemingly unrelated detritus of our
commercialized culture. Allegorical impulses, like the shadows lurking in
his diaphanous grays, acknowledge that death&#8212;physical, spiritual,
emotional&#8212;dwells just below the surface.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
The acuity of Rosenquist's media commentary can only be understood by
cross reference to his prime source material and ironic foil: the pages
of <i>Life</i> magazine. As the source collages attest, his works of
the early 1960s derive from photographic advertising images and copy,
fragments of which are then scaled-up and given substance of a different
sort through the materiality of paint. Rosenquist's selections were
archival, since the <i>Life</i> issues dated from 1945 to 1955: "I
just found some old <i>Life</i>magazines and I was, you see, searching
for the look of something. . . . I chose images common enough to pass
without notice . . . things that were a little out of style." It was the
"Populuxe" age when material progress found expression in streamlined,
automated appliances and in the look of speed epitomized by the
jet-inspired Chevrolet tailfin.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Aside from its richness as cultural anthropology, <i>Life</i>&#8212;with
its multi-layered presentation of world news, Hollywood celebrity, human
interest, and the weekly miracles of new items to buy&#8212;provided
Rosenquist with a de facto collage structure. In and of themselves,
the ingenious advertisements were a model of improbable juxtapositions,
used to surprise visually and beguile psychologically. Though his work
is often called surrealist, Rosenquist is but a realist documenting
the everyday surreality of American life, where in-depth coverage of
radiation is followed by ads for lanolin-enriched skin cream, manicured
suburban lawns reap the benefits of jet-bomber engineering contracts,
and one watches high-tech annihilation from the comfort of an easy chair.
<p>
In <i>Life</i>,violence, technology, and sex are systematically
exploited for the mass audience with managerial precision. The magazine's
sensationalism was the specific object of McLuhan's earliest critiques of
the media and the advertising industry. A decade before Betty Friedan, he
debunked the industrial workings of the feminine mystique, the pervasive
and perverse visual intercourse between woman and machine depicted in
the popular press.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Packaged with heterosexual erotic overtones, deluxe automobiles and
streamlined appliances become the objects of the new consumer economy of
desire. In Rosenquist's ribald send-up of the sex and machine cultural
mentality, appropriately titled <i>Car Touch</i>, two motorized
panels in the shapes of front end and back end bop each other as their
fenders meet. Throughout his work Rosenquist presents <i>Life</i>'s
hoodwinked phantasmagoria of housewives posing next to juice-excreting
tomatoes that "ripen from the inside out," as the caption promises.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Despite her generating heat, the 1950s siren in the kitchen is merely
an updated model of the erotic Frigidaire; she dehumanizes women and
threatens men with an impossible standard of performance. As McLuhan
was one of the first to observe, women's sexual attributes are not
associated with her "unique self" but are "merely display objects like

<b></b>

the grill work on a car. . . . They are date-baited power levers for
the management of the male audience."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Legs on a pedestal&#8212;an advertisement for seamed stockings that
introduces McLuhan's essay "The Mechanical Bride"&#8212;display
<i>Life</i>magazine's propensity to disassemble the female anatomy,
a telling analogy to the mechanisms of their own corporate "big team
clicking."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
In Rosenquist's canvases of the early 1960s, female body parts are
ubiquitous. In particular, one sees the fragmentary repetition of
three standard advertising tropes: smiling face, manicured hands,
and legs in stockings, crossed or straight (the trademark of McLuhan's
"Mechanical Bride"). Though the artist claims his "no-images" derive
from an iconographic "nether-land" without any of the associations that
"a crucifix would have," they nonetheless carry symbolic weight. The
expansive female smile (<i>Hey! Let's Go for a Ride, Look Alive,
Silver Skies</i>) is a "ritualistic mollifier," positioning woman as an
audience pleaser, both subordinate to, and approving of, the hypothetical
viewer. Hands&#8212;seen in <i>Flower Garden, President Elect</i>, and
<i>Vestigal Appendage</i>&#8212;are "a sort of offering. . . . they have
to do with advertising," according to the artist. What exactly is being
offered comes to the fore in Erving Goffman's analysis of the erotics of
nimble fingers: "women, more than men, are pictured using their fingers
and hands to trace the outlines of an object or to cradle it or to
caress its surface. . . . or to effect a 'just barely touching' of the
kind that might be significant between two electrically charged bodies."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Proffering irons or a cigarette, Rosenquist's hands embody the dominant
and domineering gender typecasting of the Cold War era: the devoted
housewife and the Hollywood babe (representations of the army butch or
office worker being much rarer).
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
McLuhan's indictment of <i>Life '</i>s pictorial reportage rests on the
sadistic effects of commingling body parts and spare parts, a criticism
made manifest in Rosenquist's paintings by the frequent appearance of
slinky legs chopped off at thigh or knees (<i>Above the Square, Sitting
Around Screaming, Brighter than the Sun</i>). The sense of danger
and erotic charge is further achieved by the razor sharp montage and
the sultry grisaille that mimic the shadowy style and doomed love of
film noir. Rosenquist's slicing and splicing translate the provocative
literary cut-ups of the Beat writer and prose assailant William Burroughs
(whose readings in the Bowery Rosenquist attended).
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
The related paintings <i>Woman I</i> <i>, Marilyn Monroe</i>
 and <i>Woman II</i>  emphasize "click of a shutter" visual
violence in the fragmentary structure of their photo-based collage. The
flashbulb velocity of the composite image also serves as metaphor for
the blinding assault of the media, for the Mechanical Bride, argues
McLuhan, is a powerful reincarnation of Medusa, against which the
collective has no defense, "no mirror of conscious reflection."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
The cosmetically enhanced smiles of <i>Woman I</i> and <i>Marilyn
Monroe</i>are more threatening than usual and allude to the toothy leers
of De Kooning's famous <i>Woman</i>series (1950-55), which was itself
stimulated by the postwar pin-up.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
But Rosenquist establishes his distance from De Kooning's gestural
excitement (and that of the Abstract Expressionist generation) by
cueing us to the impersonal "all come hither but no deliver" essence
of mechanical reproduction that he simulates in paint. The message of

<b></b>

his Marilyn Monroe also differs from Warhol's obsessive depiction of this
movie star and apotheoses of the famous, whether Jacqueline Kennedy or
Elizabeth Taylor. Warhol singles out the media power of these individuals,
even as their actual personalities are effaced by the ad nauseam copying
and smudges of the silkscreen process. By contrast, Rosenquist's painted
collage of disconnected facial features shows the platinum blonde with
red lips to be on a level with the anonymous <i>Woman I</i>and <i>Woman
II</i>&#8212;merely one more product of McLuhan's "Love-Goddess Assembly
Line," a manufactured <i>and</i> replaceable array of titbits and sound
bites. Painted letters of her name share the billing with the fragmented
logo of Coca-Cola. The audience is left unsated and hungry for more of
the same. "Hollywood has always been a supermarket of personality," writes
Lincoln Kirstein in his elegy to Monroe. "As in modern supermarkets, the
comestibles come packed with additives, preservatives and detergents;
and while not immediately lethal, such nourishment has not the savor
that nature intended."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

<p>
With sex as an instrument of power and increasingly mechanical act,
comes the automated drive to danger and destruction. <i>I Love with
You with My Ford</i> embraces technology, love, and death in its own
tripartite composition. The aggressive shifts in scale and focus and
the brutal transition from black and white to garish color adumbrate the
sense of doom. The source collage for the top register, taken from an ad
with the enticement, "Test drive a '50 Ford,"&#8212;shows the standard
female model leaning seductively on the car hood (McLuhan's pairing of
grill and girl). Though repressed in the final painting, this detail
metaphorically returns when the vertical sequence jumps fast into the
act of back seat consummation. Rosenquist makes visual the mythic "loss
of self" in the sexual act by obscuring the individuality of the couple
embracing in a movie close-up style.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
(In the 1950s, Rosenquist frequently painted the faces of Hollywood
stars on billboards.) Most noticeably, we lose our perceptual
bearings in trying to discern the features of the male, whose hair,
ear and undulating folds of flesh assume, as Rosenquist described it,
the incongruous enormity of a whale ("IWJR," 31). The shock of the
brilliant-orange spaghetti at the base of the picture reverberates as an
allusion to the spilled guts or brains of an automobile disaster. "I
thought being explicit about violence wasn't very cool or smart,"
Rosenquist reveals, "If you could suggest terror by metaphor, it was
stronger than showing terror."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
But trauma is soon assuaged when we realize that the content is all
manufactured anyway: the engine is mass-produced, the love is celluloid,
and the food is canned. Like all extensions of man, these technologies
increase work efficiency, while inuring us to over-stimulation
and simulated experience. As Rosenquist has repeatedly expressed,
"It's like being hit on the head with a ballpeen hammer. You become
numb. You're constantly hit upon. . . . So I thought something could
be done in that numbness, that power" ("IWJR," 32; "JR," 29).
<p>
Even when women were outside the home, they were associated with the
machinery at their fingertips. The 1950s saw the rise of the female office
worker, who, like the devoted housewife, provided able-bodied assistance
to the man in charge. The "pushbutton" efficiency of the secretary was
defined by her typing speed and her availability for services after hours.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
In the diptych <i>Pushbutton</i> (1960-61) an oversized fragment of a
woman's lower legs surmounts the predella of a shiny apparatus. The

<b></b>

buttons, however, do not belong to a typewriter, as the contingency of the
fingers pointed down at first suggest. Instead, the artist chose a 1947
advertisement for the then newfangled Philco car radio, whose distinctive
six square button design replaced the cumbersome tuning-dial. Now, with
the flick of a finger, one hand could instantly find the right music,
while the other was occupied with more pressing matters. Indeed, the
gendering of the hand on the right (no nails) confirms that in the office
or in the car, men are at the controls. Rosenquist's handwritten notes on
the source collage for the painting confirms the string of associations:
"driving" "push my button" "what turns me on" "rush."
<p>
Not to be confused with the automatic writing of the Surrealists
(or his personal fantasies) Rosenquist's self-conscious word play
acknowledges how common speech and technological terms are inundated with
a new heterosexualized vernacular. With <i>Hey Let's go for a Ride</i>
,the title is a sexual solicitation, and a women's inviting smile
is literally in the viewer's face. Once the provenance of subcultures,
slang is now universally transmitted through advertising and by the
instant commercialization of culturally transgressive forms.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The source collage for <i>In the Red</i> contains a selling point,
"you serve it," clipped directly from the ad copy for hearty soup. It
allows us to extrapolate on the relationship between the man's state
of dress/undress, signaled by the socks, and the woman's nakedness
in the final painting. The title itself is slang for insolvency,
financial trouble, or being "in the soup," which the image literally
depicts. It is a reminder that despite the media blitz, whole segments
of the population could not afford the material attributes of the
good life. Rosenquist's haunting narrative, with its impoverished,
tinny grays, intimates the actual pressures of "to have and have not"
on sexual and marital relationships.
<p>
The punning title of <i>Pad</i>  simultaneously refers to the
take off and landing area for aircraft and to where one beds down. The
sexual and technological are further linked by the concept of speed,
and brought into exciting proximity by the painting's pairing of United
States Air Force insignia and the glistening tailfin of a phallic
Cadillac. Rosenquist's titles draw us into to a deeper contemplation
of his pictorial rebuses. Yet, on another level, they make us aware
of the complicit relationship between the "straightforwardness" of the
photographic image and the "accuracy" of the accompanying caption. The
age of speed abbreviates communication; it forces instant recognition
and elides deep interpretation, at the same time that it impoverishes
spoken discourse into catch phrases and clich&eacute;s.
<p>
Aside from its role as pure advertising come-on, the thrill of the
automobile radically altered the courting rituals and sexual behavior
of young Americans (<i>PACC</i>, 23). Quick trysts in the automobile
replaced long and highly visible romance on the front porch. Hence
<i>Lanai</i>, whose tropical title intensifies the torpid heat of imagery,
but also puns on the car as the new lanai&#8212;the Hawaiian word for
veranda. Rosenquist's masterpiece on the collision of hot rods and hot
sell, <i>Lanai</i> drips with sensuality in paint, with textures creamy,
silky soft, and viscid above all. Female flesh exudes its artificial
glow in the honey liquid of the peaches and the titillating pink of the
female nude about to take the plunge. The painting climaxes with the
upside-down Buick

<b></b>

Skylark soaring over and spilling seed, a fluid veil of pattern created by
the "applikay" patterns of a wallpaper roller. From the Del Monte fruit
("a peach" being a common slang for a woman) to the kneeling re
derived from the White Rock girl, Rosenquist knows we know that the
metaphors are hardly fresh. As with many of his paintings, the look of
airbrush increases the visual dazzle, while simultaneously alerting us
to the manufacturing of sexual allure. "I wanted to use the tools and
technology of advertising. . . . I had been directed to paint things
hot and juicy, to sell them" ("JR," 29.)
<p>
Unlike the impermeable surfaces of Warhol and Lichtenstein, Rosenquist's
seduce with their tactile, hand-painted quality. His strokes incarnate
both the banality of the mechanical blur and the mystery of a transparent
veil. He foregrounds the media construction of heterosexual desire,
not only in the standardized iconography, but also in the visual
stimulation of all five senses. The sexual puns, both visual and verbal,
are slathered on with references to food&#8212;the tastes and textures of
oral gratification&#8212;in the form of melting butter, luscious fruits,
and dripping ice cream. Cheesecake, after all, is the term for the soft
pornographic, pin-up images of women. Slang is an inherently masculine
form of language, an aggressive release of communication that harbors
inside sexual jokes in its meaning and delivery. Food and sex are linked
by subconscious desires, made manifest in the promotion of pleasure by
advertising images and double entendres of satisfaction guaranteed.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Rosenquist's surfaces allude to the deceiving gloss of magazines and
cosmetic overlays. His brushstrokes do not revel in the butter-cream
icing consistency of a Wayne Thiebaud, but are spread out mundane and
thin, making visible their derivation from mechanical reproduction, from
<i>Life</i>magazine, and not from life itself. The individual painting
surface is eroticized in tension with the industrialized impulse of
the copy, revealing the operation of the commodity fetish underneath.
<p>
The originality of Rosenquists's send-ups and cut ups with regards to
media sex is apparent by comparison to his artistic offspring. The
<i>Celebration</i>ejaculation paintings of Jeff Koons, where melted
cheese spews across the canvas, are made all the more formulaic by
the geez whiz content of the artist's public persona. The body parts
of Rosenquist become merely repetitious and prurient views in Salle's
work, where the grisaille takes on the tawdry, onanistic glare of the TV
screen. Some twenty-five years later, plastic sentiment, visual monotony,
and mere ironic reiteration have sunk in. By contrast to Rosenquist's
critical awakening of our perceptual faculties, here nothing is added
to the expression or revelation of advertising's mechanisms, or what
media critic Stuart Ewen has called the power of "all consuming images."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist is a "jammer," who disrupts the one-way dictates and subliminal
persuasions of the media. He demands depth on the part of the viewer,
interrupting the normal state of habitual non-attentiveness.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Yet he operates in the terms of the electronic age&#8212;not by voicing
opinion in a rational, sequential analysis, but through simultaneous
relay of piecemeal, if precisely, coded information, sensory overload,
and hybrid media sources (painting, text, photography, film). His
aphoristic approach bears closer comparison to the feminist artists
of the 1980s, rather than their male contemporaries; for example the
untitled film stills of Cindy Sherman, which lay bare the

<b></b>

cinematic conventions of female sexuality and withdrawal. Rosenquist's use
of oblique and slightly scurrilous titles that prompt the viewer to fill
the gaps and be aware of manipulation predates Jenny Holzer's more sober
truisms, while Barbara Kruger's expos&eacute;s of advertising culture,
are based, like Rosenquist's, on the jarring effects of collage. Bertold
Brecht's alienation effect&#8212;ripping open the seams of the seemingly
natural&#8212;is adapted from live theater to all-encompassing commodity
spectacle.
<p>
As noted earlier, Rosenquist draws upon advertising images from the
1950s, the decade when mass psychoanalysis was systematically plumbed
by the managerial class. According to Ernst Dichter, the chief promoter
of so-called <i>motivational research</i>, the skilled advertiser had to
"sell his merchandize by associating it with ideas of success, security
and social prestige," overriding actual feelings of sexual inadequacy
and self- doubt.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Rosenquist's <i>The Light that Won't Fail I</i>  acknowledges
the illusory haze of confidence temporarily provided by the cigarette,
as the woman exhales with her head jauntily aloft. Striking a shadowy
silhouette in the lower right, the cigarette in hand reiterates the
sophisticated pose of the film noir temptress. The light will not fail in
seducing either, as we infer from the man in the act of dress/undress
(putting on or removing a sock.) "Believe in yourself!" urges the
original caption of the Philip Morris ad, prompting the selective irony
of Rosenquist's title.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Mundane products made glamorous&#8212;cigarettes, socks, and hair
comb&#8212;promise the attainment of personal goals, but when we see them
isolated from their original contexts and dispersed among simulated human
fragments, such faith in things is revealed as mere pathetic fallacy.
<p>
Dichter promoted his marriage of Freud to commodity capitalism in
books such as <i>The Psychology of Everyday Life</i>  and <i>The
Strategy of Desire</i> . With notorious efficiency, corporations
hired marketing agencies to delve into the collective mind, inspiring a
backlash of media critique and conspiracy theories, most notably Vance
Packard's 1957 <i>The Hidden Persuaders</i>.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Dichter's subliminal erotics and the ad-men's glorification of
domesticity were specifically indicted by Betty Friedan as the root
causes of the debilitating feminine mystique: "They are guilty of
persuading housewives to stay at home, mesmerized in front a TV set,
their nonsexual human needs unnamed, unsatisfied, drained by the sexual
sell into the buying of things."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Intimate with the probing and groping techniques of modern advertising,
Rosenquist made clear his debt to the market researchers and the need to
draw their innovations into the painted medium, if only to reflexively
activate our perceptions.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<i>Blue Spark</i>  incorporates an actual bamboo fishing
pole to visualize the industry's dominant metaphor of "lowering the
hooks"&#8212;to catch the consumer with the right bait and reel in the
"homo boobiens."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
One end of the pole touches the surface of flesh-colored body parts,
which are deceptively alluring, their precise identity ungraspable. The
other pulls back a cloth curtain to reveal the source of the illusions
cast before us: a set of manicured nails (a synecdoche for sexual
seduction) dangles the blue line&#8212;both the shadow of the rod and
the spark that sells.
<p>
That Rosenquist's gaze is not misogynist, but a knowing appraisal of
the mass media, emerges when we look at the larger depiction of sexual
difference in his art. True, women are standardized into objects of
seduction, their faces and bodies violently

<b></b>

decontextualized. Yet men fare no better. It is astonishing to observe
the total lack of a male visage in Rosenquist's works of the sixties,
aside from his specific portraits of John F. Kennedy, Bo Diddley and
Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley. Instead individual identity disappears,
as we see men only from behind or with headless bodies, or with their
facial features deliberately obliterated. Like <i>The Incredible Shrinking
Man</i>of 1953, Rosenquist's strategy of making men invisible functions
as an allegory of masculinity in crisis. What better pronouncement
on the fate of the modern guy than <i>Waves</i> , where he is
depicted as an anonymous blank, as an outsmarted lout who is programmed
to respond to the active solicitations of female imagery. And like the
female, the male half of consumer society is defined by what he buys and
what he wears. In paintings such as <i>Look Alive</i>, <i>In the Red
,</i> and<i>Silver Skies ,</i> Rosenquist's men also emerge in serial
fragments&#8212;most frequently in the guise of socks or trousers, or
to a lesser extent as a suit jacket or uniform&#8212;therein reduced
to businessman or sportsman, one in a series of infinitely replaceable
types. In <i>The Light that Won't Fail I</i> and<i>A Lot to Like</i>combs
and razors appears as the standard apparatus of male grooming, as mass
produced and repressive instruments of uniform hygiene and the clean-cut
look. An equal-opportunity flaneur, Rosenquist perceives the construction
of stereotypes in advertising across gender lines, sparing neither sex
in the media stream from his roving eye.
<p>
Here again, Rosenquist used advertising from earlier <i>Life</i>magazines
to comment on the sell of masculine self-image. The early 1960s was a
period during which moral attitudes and, in effect, "domestic containment"
policies of the previous decade were already being challenged by the
<i>Playboy</i> fantasy of the bachelor's domain and the Beat revolt
against materialist and rigid heterosexual values. During WWII, media
images of half-dressed soldiers and male intimacy abounded, but in the
initial Cold War years, <i>Life</i> propagated the new climate of sexual
panic and homophobia. Photographs of men touching or in suggestive
physical proximity as well as body-flexing poses and male nudity were
drastically curtailed.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
Significantly, in Rosenquist's work, the male body is never depicted
even partially unclothed, or in homosocial circumstances; as sources,
he only chose advertisements for sports and drink, the two forms of male
bonding legitimized by postwar consumer images. His underdepicted men
are painfully alone and isolated, their vulnerability and submission
to authority red by diametrically opposed views: seen from above,
socks at floor level emphasize the awkwardness of undress; seen from
below, pants suggest the submissive upward gaze of a child toward the
father. Socks and pants are common fodder for sexual slang expressing
male virility and orgasm, but in Rosenquist's compositions male
braggadocio, whether visual or verbal, is unrealized by the staid
rendition of ties, cuffs and jackets in boring shades of gray and brown.
<p>
Like his housewife counterpart, the new post-war man was a good
citizen by virtue of role-playing: breadwinner, father, patriot and
consumer. Demagogues and admen implied that any deviation from these
prescribed identities would lead to juvenile delinquency and / or
homosexuality and its "natural" counterpart, communism.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Rosenquist highlights the predicament of white middle-class masculinity,
straight jacketed

<b></b>

by standardized dress and codes of behavior. His paintings of men and
male accoutrements embody sameness and the loss of autonomy through a
repetitive, serial structure. The composition <i>1947, 1948, 1950</i>
, symbolically drained of all color, satirizes the lack of
inventiveness in business attire, in particular the tie, whose sartorial
stricture was the preeminent sign of capitalist patriarchal authority.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist pictures the leveling of personality demanded by the corporate
and military ethos, perhaps unwittingly linking America's institutional
conformism to that of totalitarian governments. His study <i>Up from the
Ranks</i> takes from a 1954 advertisement touting "Presidents of
the Company in the Bell System."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Like the grid composition of a black and white archival photograph
or mug shot, the original ad contained brief biographical copy
identifying the executives, who spent an average of 34 years, we are
told, advancing in upper management. Rosenquist reversed the placement
of the original registers and erased the faces, making them "look like
eggs in a carton." The resulting image brings to mind Stalin's practice
of eliminating individuals in fact and in historical representation:
executed party members were efficiently removed from official photographs
through montage and air brush.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Warhol subsequently used a mug shot as the basis for his mural
<i>Thirteen Most Wanted Men ,</i> created for Philip Johnson's New York
State Pavilion at 1964 World's Fair. The inside joke title refers not
only to the FBI's most wanted list but also the potential objects of
Warhol's homosexual desire.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
By contrast, Rosenquist's washed-out men remain unwanted on every level;
they are "up from the ranks to nowhere," as the artist confirmed.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
Although they bear the attributes of power suits, the corporate seal
of approval, and horny-rimmed glasses, one concludes that the blonde
women masquerading in <i>Life</i> indeed had more fun.
<p>
Rosenquist's <i>Shave</i> brilliantly delineates the fragile
boundaries of the male self. The ritual act of shaving normally affirms
virility, but here the face of the man disappears, obliterated by the
encroaching negative space of the yellow shaving cream, as Rosenquist
specifically intended.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The psychological effect is remarkably similar to <i>Portrait in a
Mirror</i> , the photograph by Surrealist Raoul Ubac of a face
reflected in a corroding mirror. In both works, the reflected image
subverts rather than confirms identity, by dissolving facial features
and contours. As Rosalind Krauss observes (drawing on the mirror stage
thesis of Jacques Lacan), the "disarticulation of the self" by means
of its reflected double "immobilizes the subject in a cat's cradle of
representation." One's own sight no longer constitutes the site of the
self. Rosenquist's choice of gender confirms that not only female, but
also male subjectivity, is constructed by the power of appropriating
gazes, directed from without.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>

<p>
The crises of male identity and the loss of self attributed to the
corporate mentality were popularized in the 1950s by best-selling
nonfiction such as David Reisman's <i>The Lonely Crowd</i>,
William Whyte's <i>The Organization Man</i>  and by Sloan Wilson's
novel <i>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</i> . Sharing a similar
social critique, these authors bemoaned changing American values and
character. Buying power had replaced individualism and having things
compensated for lack of personal agency. In particular, Reisman
articulated the evolution from "inner-directed man," whose

<b></b>

drive was motivated by underlying personal ethics, to "other-directed man"
who was led by the approval of peers groups and the desire to belong. As
opposed to the individualistic thinker of the nineteenth century, who
knew too much, the man of modern industrialized society "never knew who
he was."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
In <i>Volunteer</i> , Rosenquist documents the predicament of "the
volunteer who is puzzled; doesn't know what to do but is willing," as he
wrote on the collage study for the work. The headless man ratively
finds his place in uniform, branded by his green suit and red armband, and
regimented by the belt illusionistically tightened across the perimeter
of the painting's surface. Of the various permutations of men in uniform,
Rosenquist also focuses on the virile athlete. His <i>4 1949 Guys</i>
questions the social status accorded to pure physical prowess, as well
as the commercial practice of celebrity endorsement. The original 1949
advertisement displayed the photographic portraits of "four top men in
American sports" (Lou Boudreau, Ben Hogan, Joe Di Maggio and Jack Kramer),
each promoting the Chesterfield brand: "the one I'm really glad to put
my name on. It's <i>my</i>cigarette."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
In the final painting a looming gun barrel, an ice-cream cone and body
parts efface the original personalities. He upends the traditional role
of attributes in portraiture, since the thing no longer becomes the man,
but the man becomes the thing itself.
<p>
The rugged athletes, army men, and resolute corporate executives assessed
by Rosenquist likewise provided McLuhan with his masculine counterparts to
the mechanical brides. The strong man demeanor and survival of the fittest
mentality were both quaint and hopelessly biological, observed McLuhan,
by comparison to the actual powers behind the media that proffered
these stereotypes: "Real toughness today has shifted from the personal
Darwinian melodrama to the abstractions of logistics, cybernetics
and consumer research. Thanks to the refinements and perversions of
statistical measurement and International Business Machine logistics,
it is now easy for little esthetising gents to be much more powerful
than the Jadwins ever were. Goebbels was much more dangerously corrupt
and destructive than Goering.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist's imagery implicitly acknowledges that corporate
advertising was for decades a male-driven, propaganda machine, but
one of his few images where men and women appear together is highly
instructive. <i>Untitled (Blue Sky</i> as it is appropriately
named, asks the viewer to step into the picture and occupy a role. Two
rectangular panels, oriented in opposite directions, form empty screens
on which we may project our own faces. Below each panel, either trousers
and wingtips or stockings and pumps cue us as to which side we belong,
the masculine or feminine. Yet with a last minute reversal to keep us
on our toes, Rosenquist colors the male half pink and the female, dull
shades of gray, confounding established codes of gender difference. By
rendering the physical gait of the pair otherwise identical, he also
underscores how our expectations are socially constructed. The largely
empty field of the canvas and dumb presence of the rectangles in place
of talking heads, suggests we are all considered blank slates, ready to
be scripted by advertising or editorial blurbs.
<p>
The postwar phenomenon of burgeoning suburbia did much to inculcate
gender stereotypes of doting fathers and devoted housewives. Rosenquist
reserved his most

<b></b>

poignant imagery for the rendition of empty yards and Levittown-like
subdivisions, substituting single photo-based images for his usual
collage cut-ups. <i>Untitled (Two Chairs)</i>, <i>Win a New House This
Christmas (Contest) ,</i> and <i>Front Lawn</i> capture dreary sameness in
subject and style. Visual monotony arises from the methodical absence of
facture and the arresting of the photographic blur in painted form. The
garish glow of soon-to-be-outmoded decor and ad copy promoting dreams
come true betray the mood of quiet desperation. In <i>Growth Plan</i>
the artist paints a collective portrait of the Wonder Bread years,
lining up his subjects with a militaristic discipline redolent of
Alesandr Rodchenko's 1930s photographs of Soviet youth. Rosenquist's
own appropriation of a photographic image accentuates the anonymity
and replicated aura of mass-produced people. <i>Rainbow ,</i> an
uncharacteristically melodramatic image, envisions the release of
pent-up frustrations endemic to 1950s conformity. Broken glass and a
threatening fork puncture the serenity of the nuclear family pictured
in <i>Life</i>and on the TV screen. "Stabbing the meat; blood in the
rainbow," the artist's description on the source collage attests.
<p>
Rosenquist's <i>Nomad</i>, an epic on the itinerant culture of commodity
capitalism, depicts life lived from one "NEW" purchase to another. Fast
food and picnic tables cater to the temporary quality of modern
existence, and home sweet home can be recreated wherever the billfold
opens. <i>Nomad</i> displays an oversized General Electric bulb, a
leitmotif that appears throughout Rosenquist's work. For McLuhan, electric
light represented the most primitive medium of mass communication, one
that nonetheless radically eliminates time and space in human relations to
form the conduit of our "global village." The tribal condition of modern
man, he writes, arises from the disembodied connections of high-speed
technology, which "mingles the cultures of prehistory with the dregs
of industrial marketers, the non-literate with the semiliterate and the
postliterate" (<i>UM</i>, 16). Not coincidently, the tomato sauce in the
lower right of <i>Nomad</i>derives from an ad where the copy reads "Hunt
for the best" (a pun on the Hunt's brand name) Rosenquist's nomadism also
refers to the condition of fine art in the age of mechanical reproduction
and museum spectacle. "The way art is sent around, all over the place. . . there could almost be a suitcase handle on the top of this picture."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<p>
The nomadic image emerged with prints, proliferated with photography,
and exponentially increased with television, whose medium also occupied
Rosenquist in a series of TV paintings that mimic the kinetic flow
and linear waves of the low-resolution screen. The unrivalled power of
television as a vehicle of persuasion&#8212;"the new frontier"&#8212;was
confirmed by John F. Kennedy's campaign for the Democratic nomination
in 1959-60.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
Kennedy became known as the "television President" for his successful
exploitation of the medium, fine-tuning the mass sales pitch begun
in the 1950s when Madison Avenue turned politics into a consumer
business. The Republicans had earlier gained the lead in marketing with
the advertising agency B. B. D &amp; O. Although the Democrats then
hired Norman, Craig &amp; Kummel, the firm that had created the wildly
successful "I Dreamed I Went Walking in my Maidenform Bra" campaign,
Adlai Stevenson lost to the incumbent Eisenhower in the 1956 election.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Stevenson, nonetheless,

<b></b>

had the last word: "The idea that you can merchandise candidates for
high office like breakfast cereal . . . is the ultimate indignity to
the democratic process."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
The Democrats' win in 1960&#8212;a piece of cake, as Rosenquist surmised
in <i>President Elect</i>&#8212;was in no small part due to Kennedy's
talent as poster boy. His image saturated in the media, Kennedy became,
like the junk food and car, another promotional item. "<i>President
Elect</i> is about an empty promise," confirms the artist, "It is
picture of a man advertising himself."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist admits his fascination with the "speed and force" of the mass
media, "the way things are thrust at us, the way this invisible screen
that's a couple of feet in front of our mind and our senses is attacked
by radio and television and visual communications."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
The multifold data torrent that has altered habitual sense perceptions
and cognitive processes gave rise to McLuhan's dictum "the medium is
the message"; the way information is conveyed, rather than its content
per se, constitutes the real power of mass communication. After the
linear thinking of the typeset press and mechanical age, we entered the
non-sequential scattershot domain of images. Rosenquist's cinematic
<i>Horseblinders</i> is a parable of vision in daily experience: how
our lives are governed by forces that we cannot, or choose not to,
see. This wraparound composition demands exactly the peripheral vision
that would be blocked by side-shades or horseblinders. Blind is the
operative metaphor here, appearing in the choice of art historical
sources and information communicated sight unseen.
<p>
A thumbnail pressing a button begins the narrative of simultaneous
disconnect, assaulting the viewer with scintillating images switched
on with intermittent frequency. In a red panel at bottom, a single
telephone cord unfolds in multiple profiles, its movement rendered
like a chronophotograph by Etienne Jules Marey. (Invented in the late
nineteenth century, stop-action photography went beyond the capability
of the naked eye, and was adapted by modern artists such as Duchamp to
picture simultaneity itself.) Large panels resembling faux wood grain
with superimposed ovoid forms paraphrase Max Ernst's <i>Blind Swimmer</i>
paintings , which were specifically inspired by Marey's photographic
studies of aerodynamics.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
These panels are connected to an adjacent watery blue field; "Platex Swim
Caps" was writ large on the surface of a pool in the original photo-based
advertisement. Three arcs of light spring forth as pure energy, and
our eyes jump to the colored wire spaghetti of a spliced telephone
cable. Current and flow energize Rosenquist's <i>Horseblinders</i>,
dazzling our eyes with "Day-Glo" color and blurred forms reflected
helter skelter from the painting's shiny aluminum panels. Recognizable
kitchen appliances situate us in a technologically efficient home,
but the question remains as to how plugged into reality we really
are. "It's about being blind to what's going on," states Rosenquist,
underlining the political dimensions of what seems, at first glance,
to be merely a diversion-filled art.
<p>
McLuhan proclaimed that technology alters "sense ratios or patterns
of perception steadily and without any resistance. The serious
artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity,
because he [sic] is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception"
(<i>UM</i>, 18). The role of the late modern seer, combining conceptual
and traditional fine art practices, is to raise the level of visual
literacy. Rosenquist

<b></b>

cites the avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage as an influence on his own
pictorial strategies. In his <i>Metaphors on Vision</i> Brakhage writes
of the need for "alive perceptibility," for a particular attention to
the false mirror of mechanical reproduced images. After working in the
motion picture industry Brakhage turned to art films that tested the
viewer's capacity for concentration, boredom and shock. With techniques
analogous to Rosenquist's compositions, Brakhage's films make vision
new by playing with soft and hard resolution, gigantism and minutiae,
and intercut camera angles.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
Both artists focus on the fundamental paradox of the photograph: a
mechanical and chemical process that faithfully records nature, so we
believe, even though we know the image can be thoroughly manipulated
and decontextualized. "'To say the camera cannot lie," quipped McLuhan,
"is merely to underline the multiple deceits that are now practiced in
its name" (<i>UM</i>, 192). By transforming readymade photographs into
paint, Rosenquist detracts from the hot instantaneity of the camera
image and slows it down, demanding a cool or distanced analysis of the
truth it purports to represent.
<p>
In addition to advertisements, <i>Life</i>magazine provided Rosenquist
with fodder to expose the alleged realism of the documentary news
photograph. As founder Henry Luce inadvertently acknowledged in his
mission statement, the new picture magazine had less to do with the
reality of life than how perception shapes our reality: "To see life;
to see strange things; to see things thousands of miles away; to see
and take pleasure in seeing; to see and be instructed."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
The last enjoinder reveals the degree to which <i>Life</i> aimed at
building consensus and national identity through the transparency of the
photographic image. The indiscriminate plethora of visuals in <i>Life</i>
blurred the lines between editorial and advertising, instantaneous
reportage and informed interpretation. Moreover the interspersing of ads
and news features revealed the actual traffic (and frequent conflict of
interest) between the free-enterprise system and the democratic process.
<p>
The photograph had grave consequences for the transformation of
historical consciousness: it arrested the temporal duration previously
ascribed to the linear flow of events into instantaneous, unconnected
moments. As Walter Benjamin surmised, the advent of photography turns the
representation of history into a series of isolated frames, suspending
continuity with the past.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
History becomes mere news of the day. The "front page cubism" of the
popular press eclipses time and distance, levels values, and sustains
moral relativism: celebrities become the new role models, and daily
interest stories of little people compete with the actions of military
coups.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Unbelievable horrors are immediately surpassed and forgotten by the
time the next unprecedented tragedy comes along. As another form of
technology, the media builds in its own obsolescence and with it, the
negation of historical memory. Acutely aware of the demise of sustained
analysis in the age of information overload, Rosenquist comments,
"the minute you take a position on a question or an idea, then the
acceleration of technology, plus other things, will in a short time
have already moved you down the conveyor belt" ("TF111," 590).
<p>
Nonetheless, Rosenquist takes his place as a history painter for his
times, in an era when the likes of Picasso's <i>Guernica</i>, with its
black and white oppositions, can no longer

<b></b>

be rendered. Linear narratives and fixed points of view, like the rigid
eye of the camera, have made all perspectives suspect. Conspiracy theories
abound with the potentially falsified evidence of the mechanically
reproduced image. To make his point, Rosenquist critiques from within
the system, through allusion and gradually imparted information, rather
than making didactic pronouncements from without. The enormous scale of
Rosenquist's works, unlike that of any other Pop artist, clearly places
him in the tradition of mural painting and a politicized, public art. He
has mentioned his debt to the Mexican muralists, though the influence
has never been systematically explored ("TF111," 595). Most noticeably,
his style distinctly recalls that of Siqueiros, who employed photo-based
preparatory techniques, spray-gun, and airbrush, as opposed to the
traditionally executed frescos of Rivera and Orozco. Siqueiros also
used aggressive disparaties of scale and peripheral visual activity to
manipulate the viewer's perceptual faculties.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
Gigantic machine parts dominate his proto-Pop iconography of
technology, material excess, and violence. As in his <i>Portrait of the
Bourgeoisie</i> (Electricians Syndicate, Mexico City, 1939-40) Siqueiros
typically placed a menacing conglomerate of gears at center, whose
centrifugal force expands into the viewer's space&#8212;a compositional
device employed by Rosenquist in the projectile lipsticks of <i>House
of Fire II</i> and <i>Swimmer in the Economist</i>.
<p>
By contrast to Siqueiros's murals of class revolution, Rosenquist
paints the post-war world of the atomic bomb. The previous generation
of Abstract Expressionists had also rendered the anxieties of the
nuclear age. Banishing ration, Rothko, Pollock, and Newman depicted
the sublime power of a limitless nature, drawing parallels between
primitive and modern man in the face of unknown or insurmountable
terrors. Dispensing with primordial myths, Rosenquist brings history
painting up to date with specific, if already outmoded images of the
American good life. His works make us confront the superficiality of
consumerism with the profound threat of annihilation. As in the layouts
of <i>Life</i>, where riveting photographs of atomic-test explosions
dovetailed with ads for kitchen gadgets, Rosenquist's imagery encapsulates
the dichotomies of the "pushbutton age." General Electric, Westinghouse,
Chrysler, and Goodyear were all major defense hardware contractors.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
In <i>Pad</i>the pairing of light bulb and airforce insignia visualizes
the political and economic link between household convenience and
automated warfare.The bizarre juxtapositions of tires and heavy
atmosphere, mushroom clouds and hair dryers are not so random after all.
<p>
From deterrent to menace, the specter of nuclear terror undermined the
security wrought by the economic boom of the 1950s and motivated the
generation of the New Left generation.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
Rosenquist acknowledged the direct influence of the Beats, such as
Allen Ginsberg, whose imagery of "sexless hydrogen bombs," pointed to
the underside of the American affluence.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Ginsberg's "Howl"  famously raged against capitalist greed
and its moral destruction of America: "Moloch! Moloch! Robot
apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasures! blind
capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible
madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!"
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
More subtly, Rosenquist unwrapped the governmental packaging of military
might and free enterprise to present the disturbing reality of American
Cold War policy. Take <i>A Lot to</i>

<b></b>

<i>Like</i>&#8212;an ironic retort to the Presidential campaign slogan
"I Like Ike." The rapid-fire sequence of sex and things rendered in
pastel shades and milky-smooth grisaille evokes the material lot enjoyed
during the seemingly benign Eisenhower years. But the visual abundance is
graphically interrupted by the mechanized strokes of hard rain falling
at the bottom rectangle of the canvas. It was painted in 1962, the year
of the Cuban missile crises, during the stand-off between Kennedy and
Khrushchev, when the United States and the Soviet Union almost came to
nuclear blows.
<p>
In the pendant <i>Silver Skies</i><b>,</b> painted that same year,
Rosenquist used a wallpaper roller to leaden the background with "solid
atmosphere" a troubling evocation of radioactive air. The resulting
patterns, like delicate inked script, distinctly evoke the gestures and
vertical columns of Japanese calligraphy. Could Rosenquist's signature
red flower, used here for the first time, possibly refer to the radio
propagandist, Tokyo Rose, or to Ginsberg's radioactive rose? Prompted
by the current crises, <i>Silver Skies</i>and <i>A Lot to Like</i>
looked back to the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, going so far as
to poignantly evoke the imagery of Japanese prints. "Hiroshige rain"
Rosenquist wrote on the bottom of the source collage for <i>A Lot
to Like ,</i> creating an unnerving verbal play between the famous
ukiyo-e artist Ando Hiroshige (1797-1858) and the site of unprecedented
"black rain." In later interviews Rosenquist referred to the umbrella,
not only as protection from fallout, but as an aperture for a view
remarkably like those of famous nineteenth-century, Japanese woodcuts:
"looking out the window and seeing a bright red and yellow atomic bomb
blast, something like a cherry blossom . . . a realistic vision, with
frost or snow on top of it."
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
Rosenquist quotes from among the most famous images of a nation's
self-representation, to mourn its unconceivable destruction.
<p>
By contrast, <i>Life</i> magazine graphically documented the atomic
age from the devastating carnage in Japan to the test explosions in the
South Pacific and Nevada; pictorial essays on mushroom clouds erupting
in the desert sky&#8212;the terrifying and awesome spectacle of the
"atomic sublime"&#8212;occurred regularly through the mid-1950s.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
Rosenquist's <i>Brighter than the Sun</i> takes its title from
Robert Jungk's book on the atomic scientists. Here the legs of McLuhan's
mechanical bride reappear as a new form of bombshell, like the pinup of
Rita Hayworth purportedly stenciled to a bomb dropped on Bikini Atoll
in 1946.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
The omnipresent sexual reference takes on its full <i>noir</i>
significance in the commingling of eros and thanatos, in the explosive
climax of certain death. "More powerful a soap box economy or a
hydrogen bomb?" writes Rosenquist on the source collage, where the
orange and yellow "O" logo of the Oxydol laundry detergent is eclipsed
by the luminous, ultraviolet glow of a nuclear blast. The marriage of
nylon seamed stockings and modern warfare indicts the common economic
underpinnings of the military industrial complex.
<p>
A catchphrase used by Sixties radicals to protest the inhumane workings
of big government, "the military-industrial complex" was in fact coined
by Eisenhower in his 1961 Farewell Address, as a specific warning for
America's future: "This conjunction of an immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total
influence&#8212;economic, political, even spiritual&#8212;is felt in every

<b></b>

city. . . . Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
Under the subsequent Kennedy administration, however, the "unwarranted
influence of the military industrial complex" only increased, a fact
duly noted by Rosenquist in his <i>F111</i>, where in one source
collage stacks of Kennedy half-dollars lie behind the fuselage of
the new military bomber. Rosenquist's monumental response to the
government's preemptive first-strike policy and its covert and overt
operations abroad, <i>F111</i> protests the spending of tax dollars on
death technology. Rosenquist highlights the irony of a war economy whose
material benefits entice the masses and keeps them content. "The prime
force of this thing has been to keep people working, an economic tool;
but behind it, this is a war machine."
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
The gleaming helmet of the "little girl pilot," as the artist calls her,
further links industrial production and military might. The <i>F111</i>
reverberates with the proximity of violence unleashed by distant warfare,
of forces that spare no one, not even innocent children smiling under
shiny hairdryers.
<p>
To return to our opening question, what makes Rosenquist's work so of
the moment? Its continued political relevancy. The reality of nuclear
disaster continues to be upon us, not only in the form of accidents
or potential military confrontation, but in also the dirty bombs of
terrorism. As Rosenquist confirms, "All generations since the first
nuclear bomb was exploded have had to live with that feeling. There
are protests and then they die down. There is nervousness and then that
dies down. There are accidents at nuclear plants and that's shocking,
terrible, and then everyone pretends the problems don't exist."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
In the immediate aftermath of 11 September 2001 (not 9/11&#8212;a
typically high speed, journalistic condensation) Mayor Giuliani
urged New Yorkers to go out and buy, to keep the economy going and
relieve the shock of violence through the reassuring comfort of
habitual consumption. Appealing to Americans' basic instinct for
survival, Giuliani gave new meaning to the phrase <i>shop 'til you
drop</i>. Ultimately Rosenquist's paintings acknowledge the public's
inculcated sense of helplessness, of not being able to see through
to the larger picture, despite the surfeit of information. Blinded by
material comforts and by the conviction that political freedom brings,
we are, in the artist's own words, "like a bug hitting a light bulb
. . . we keep making the same mistakes, over and over again."

"The Brothel-without-Walls" serves as the chapter epitaph on "The
Photograph" in Marshall McLuhan <i>Understanding Media: Extensions of

identify his source for the phrase, p.189: "In a word, photography has
inspired Jean Genet with the theme of the world since photography as a
Brothel-without-Walls." The promiscuity of the camera image is one of
the underlying themes of Susan Sontag's <i>On Photography</i> (1973;

In 1966 Rosenquist served on a panel discussion with McLuhan in Toronto
along with critic Gene Swenson, who recounted their meeting in Gene
Swenson, "James Rosenquist: The re a Man Makes," <i>The Register of
the Museum of Art</i>4 (24 October-5 December 1981), 53-81; part of a
special issue "Gene Swenson: Retrospective for a Critic," The University
of Kansas, Lawrence, 58. Henceforth abbreviated as "TFAMM." The passage
is worth quoting at length because it is filled with clever allusions
to McLuhan's recent <i>Understanding Media</i>  and offers proof
that both Swenson and Rosenquist were very familiar with McLuhan's
theories, his witticisms, and pronouncement style of writing: "He
brought McLuhan a fly swatter with a plastic sunflower attached to one
of its sides. . . . The sunflower swatter politely but firmly refused,
on more than one level, to convey a message through its medium, at any
rate as I understand that phrase; the message it conveyed as a gift was,
shall we say, tropical. 'Nature,' transformed into a plastic sunflower,
was used to decorate and in some sense modernize an old-fashioned pest
killer. Nature, in the form of a rainstorm, once caused the paper suit
to disintegrate in Japan, leaving the artist high and dry."

Rosenquist alludes to Duchamp's influence in Jeanne Siegel "An

[henceforth abbreviated as "IWJR"] where he also recalls attending a
lecture by Richard Hamilton on Duchamp's "glass piece," <i>The Bride
Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even .</i> On numerous other occasions,
Rosenquist mentions having met Duchamp: for example, in Gene Swenson,
"Social Realism in Blue: An Interview with James Rosenquist," <i>Studio
International</i>175 (February 1968), 79; henceforth abbreviated as
"SRIB." Craig Adcock, "An Interview with James Rosenquist," in <i>James

Michael Lobel argues in <i>Image Duplicator: Roy Lichtenstein and the
Emergence of Pop Art</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), 1,
that the esthete Lichtenstein "came to be read as the consummate detached
formalist," and, 23, that he and Warhol "were cast, respectively,
as the good boy and bad boy of Pop art." C&eacute;cile Whiting, <i>A
Taste for Pop: Pop Art, Gender, and Consumer Culture</i> (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1997), 128-32 reads Lichtenstein's public
persona as a renegotiated masculinity &#8212;neither the camp dandy of
Warhol nor the aggressive virility of Pollock,

<b></b>

he represents "both the potentially emasculated" American middle-class
father and the "cerebral, professional" artist. Oddly, despite the title
of her book, Whiting gives no attention to the work of Rosenquist with
its obvious engagement with commodity culture and advertising. On Warhol
see Jennifer Doyle, Jonathan Flatley and Jos&eacute; Esteban Mu&ntilde;oz
(eds.), <i>Pop Out: Queer Warhol</i>(Durham NC: Duke University Press,

the presumed sexual potency and ballsy identity of the Abstract American
painters, and to the subtext that only heterosexuals can make authentic
high art.

In an interview with the artist, Mary Anne Staniszewski, "James
Rosenquist," <i>Bomb</i> 21 (Fall 1987), 29 [henceforth abbreviated
as "JR"] directly addressed the representation of sex in Rosenquist's
pictures: "Do you see your paintings as images of hetero-male desire? In
the Eighties a lot of people might ask those kinds of questions as they
look at your work. Are these paintings directed at a traditional notion
of male desire? Do you ever think about these questions?" The artist
skirted the issue and proceeded to talk about "getting the energy to work"
within the paintings.

Thomas Crow in "Warhol's Saturday Disasters: Trace and Reference in
Early Warhol," in <i>Modern Art and the Common Culture</i> (New Haven:

and disaster have more personal meaning and more social commentary than
are normally credited to the artist.

Here I disagree with Christin J Mamiya in <i>Pop Art and Consumer
Culture. American Super Market</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press,
1992, [henceforth abbreviated as <i>PACC</i>] who argues on page 4
that Pop art "ultimately deflected or absorbed social and political
criticism about consumer culture" because it merely reflected the
system and participated in it through its own marketing practices. In
Rosenquist's case, there is no ambiguity; moreover, Mamiya rules
out the possibility of critique from within, a distinct possibility,
given the minimum demarcation between public and private in the late
capitalist period. Mamiya's claim on page 79 that the work of the Pop
artists shows "no visible transformation from news photo to canvas"
is also questionable. Of course, every generation differs as to what
constitutes a politicized art: Rosenquist's contemporaries and his
earliest champions stressed the ideological dimension of his work,
most notably Lawrence Alloway, "Derealized Epic," <i>Artforum</i> 10
(June 1972), 35-41; Gene Swenson in the interviews conducted with the
artist in the 1960s noted below, and in "TFAMM"; and Lucy Lippard,
"James Rosenquist: Aspects of a Multiple Art," <i>Artforum</i> 4
(December 1965), 41-6. The overt protest of Rosenquist's <i>F 111</i>
is researched by Edward Jerome Adler, "American Painting and the Vietnam

Siegel, "IWJR," 32. "There was more throb, more action, and I begin
to think there was more power and more massive things in advertising
than there was in the intellect of a person making a painting in a
studio. Also, I saw soap boxes being designed in advertising agencies
and they used to pin the soap boxes on the walls to see who would look
at them the most and I thought there's more visual things worked out
there than there is an artist's studio working singularly. . . . "
Most recently, Rosenquist

<b></b>

recollects, "I could paint any kind of advertisement that would sell
something because I had years of experience doing it. I could make
something that would sell a product and make money for somebody. But art
for me is something different from that. . . . And I thought . . . How
can I use the same energy to do something different?" in Paul Taylor,

that in his <i>Handbook of Consumer Motivations</i>, 246, Ernest Dichter
analyses fishing as a sport that "has retained its traditionally masculine
characteristic"&#8212;it represents the "incomparable thrill of the
actual catch," and "a form of mastering the outside world, comparable
to hunting." Rosenquist also used a bamboo fishing pole in <i>Two 1959

<i>Drawing</i> 5 (July-August 1983), 32-3: "When something caught
my eye, I would attach it to the wall. I saw a picture of telephone
executives in a magazine, so I erased all their faces. They looked
like eggs in a carton. It was a kind of autobiographical answer to
'What am I doing here?'" In a recent interview with Julia Blaut, in his
Chambers Street studio, 31 May 2002, Rosenquist said: "I thought it was
a pun. . . . They're up from the ranks to nowhere." Julia Blaut, "James

McLuhan, <i>TMB</i>, 131. McLuhan's observation is worthwhile comparing
to Rosenquist's statement in G. R. Swenson, "The F111: An Interview with
James Rosenquist by G.R. Swenson," <i>Partisan Review</i>32 (Fall 1965),
595 [henceforth abbreviated as "TF111"]: "If a company or institution is
using people like digits and massing them in schools of learning towards
appreciating new ideas and new inventions, I react to that and try to
pose a problem to think in terms of humanity again."

Rosenquist cited in Swenson, "SRIB," 80 in reference to a picture "with
a rug and a hand." The canvas in question may be <i>Taxi</i>
with its fragmented image of a hand running its fingers through the
deep pile of grass, although the "itinerant image of home-sweet-home"
is equally applicable to <i>Nomad</i>. As Gitlin argues in <i>Media
Unlimited</i>, 59 and 107, "nomadicity" is also the condition of the
electronic information age, since we are "never away but always at home";
moreover "the fully equipped nomad, seeking freedom of access at will,
becomes fully accessible to other people's wills."

Rosenquist names the experimental films of Brakhage in "If You Get a

February 2000)," in <i>Parkett</i>58 , 40. Brakhage<i>, Metaphors

realism. . . . what reflects from the screen is shadow play. . . . Nowhere
in its mechanical process does the camera hold either mirror or candle
to nature. . . . it remains a fabricator of a visual language, no less a
linguist than the typewriter." Fred Camper "Brakhage's Contradictions,"

that they shape a new set of attitudes and "wallop the subconscious"
without appearing to do. His finest lines are reserved for <i>Life</i>,
11: "The initial layout consisted of heavy doses of pictorial violence,
mayhem, and death plus equally heavy rations of strip tease (in ads and
news alike), plus a wodge of pseudo-science in the form of pictorialized
'wonders of modern science.' Girlie art remains the heavy staple, but
violence and mayhem have been somewhat reduced and religious art given
a place beside pseudo-science. The twenty million or more <i>Life</i>
readers are not given the same encouragement to think of themselves as
a tight little club of knowing sophisticates as are Timereaders."

In "TF111," 599, Rosenquist states: "To me it's now a generation removed,
the post-Beat young people. They're not afraid of an atomic war and think
that sort of attitude is pass&eacute;, that it won't occur. The Beat
people, like Kerouac and Robert Frank, Dick Bellamy, Ginsberg and Corso,
their first sensibility was of it being used immediately and they were
hit by the idea of it, they were shocked and sort of threatened. Now
the younger people are blas&eacute; and don't think it can happen. So
this is a restatement of that Beat idea, but in full color." The artist
also mentions his personal contacts with the Beats in Staniszewski,

In "TF111," 596, the artist recalls his wallpaper roller technique, used
first in <i>Silver Skies :</i> "I saw the pattern in an elevator lobby
and thought of a solid atmosphere; you walk outside of your apartment
into what used to be open air and all of a sudden feel that it has become
solid with radioactivity and other undesirable elements." In the same
interview Rosenquist goes on, 599, to discuss the umbrella imagery in
the F111, though it is equally applicable to its initial appearance in
<i>A Lot to Like</i>. Swenson asks: "Is that about fallout?" to which
the artist replies, "I suppose the umbrella could be something about
fallout, but for me it's like someone raising his umbrella or raising
his window in the morning; looking out the window and seeing a bright
red and yellow atomic bomb blast, something like a cherry blossom,
a beautiful view of an atomic blast. . . . The umbrella is realistic,
it's a realistic vision, with frost or snow on top of it." Hiroshige's
<i>Fifty-three Stations on the Tokaido</i>was published in 1833-1835

1 The Music-Hall Helps the Cause of Colonialism
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
It is 1903, a year after the black American dance, the Cake-Walk,
arrived in Paris and immediately became as popular a dance as the
Charleston would be in the Roaring Twenties. From the circus to the
music-hall, the Cake-Walk attraction was de rigeur. Across town from
the Moulin-Rouge, at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, Ashanti villagers were
providing an equally popular attraction. A review in the <i>Courrier
Fran&ccedil;ais</i> of the floor show currently at the Moulin-Rouge
defends the genre of the <i>Grande Revue ,</i> accused of incessantly
repeating itself. The "grotesque or charming dances" where the art of
"voluptuousness" reigns is the principal element there designed to give
Parisians an hour of "pure pleasure." The pretty legs, splendid decor,
and lighting may be trivial (<i>l&eacute;ger</i>), but they represent a
specifically Parisian art. This art is epitomized by the Moulin Rouge, and

<b></b>

the Moulin Rouge is known the world over by blacks, whites, Asians,
80 year-olds and virgins: "It's a subject of conversation in Tchad and
in Tanganyika." But that is not the only glory of the Grande Revue: the
Moulin Rouge actually contributes to the cause of colonialism! "You can
be sure that at this very moment, heroic . . . explorers, feverish and
tired, deep in the darkness of Africa and among the grimacing blacks,
see in their dreams, rising on the infested swamps the lights and
gracefulness of the Moulin Rouge. And these strong men find in these
trivialities an influx of courage. . . . The raised skirts contribute a
little, just a little, to discoveries a little more important than the
revelation of pretty legs."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
One institution&#8212;the music hall&#8212;nurtures
another&#8212;colonialism.Read this essay in light of the fact that the
music-halls and their predecessors, the caf&eacute;-concerts, are one
of the primary sites for the influx of African, Caribbean, and black
American newcomers in Paris, on-stage as well as off. Turning around the
idea expressed in the above article, here we will see how colonialism
contributed to the music-hall. The images and fantasies that made up
the extraordinary popularity of "grimacing blacks" in the music-hall,
caf&eacute;-concert, and circus, beginning in the late 1870s with
minstrels and African dancers, had a far greater influence on popular
entertainment between 1878 and 1910 than has previously been thought.

2 The Hysteric and the Savage
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Every time that the Belgian artist F&eacute;licien Rops came to Paris, he
was astonished by the fantastical look of the contemporary Parisian woman,
"who seemed to come from another world, <i>as foreign as a Hottentot</i>."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
As I hope to show here, the distance between the image of the Hottentot
and the persona adopted by white music-hall singers and dancers was
not as far as one might imagine.
<p>
In previous work, I have drawn an analogy between hysterics, epileptics,
and caf&eacute;-concert performance. The startling rise in cases of
hysteria coincided in time with the creation in 1875 of a new genre of
caf&eacute;-concert performer called the Epileptic Singer. Mark Micale
has noted that "around 1878, the name of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
invaded even the popular magazines and newspapers."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The first sensational displays of African dance and of
half-naked black bodies date from 1878 when Zulus danced at the
Folies-Berg&egrave;re. 1878 is also the year that Darwin's theory of
evolution was officially recognized in France. It is a year to which I
will have occasion to return. The simultaneity of these three spectacular
phenomena&#8212;hysteria, Epileptic Singers, and African dance&#8212;all
highly <i>m&eacute;diatique</i> displays of the body in movement which
reached mass audiences, could not help but create some degree of amalgam
in the popular imagination. Journalistic descriptions show that this is
<i>precisely</i> what occurred, and one of the effects was to inspire
a fear of contagion: of gesture, of hysteria, of regression. That is
the crux of this essay: I want to show how the three attractions are
interconnected. By looking at the extremely popular re of the
Epileptic Singer between 1875 and 1907, we can observe the fusing
of the Hysteric and the Savage in the media and in the minds of the
average French citizen. Colonialism and medicine; science and popular
entertainment; the hysteric and the savage.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Celebrity provides a lens for discovering what people

<b></b>

admire, desire, and deride: in short, for what magnetizes them. How much
the celebrity of these performers might have to do with the self-image
of French spectators will be taken up in the last section of this
essay. It is fair to say that the image of the <i>savage</i>&#8212;so
often emphasized in the way people saw cancan dancers, semi-nude chorus
girls, and the Epileptic Singers I am going to discuss here&#8212;was
in fact the <i>predominant</i> re of the sexually desirable woman
in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and in the beginning of
the twentieth. Exotic articles of strangeness, the hysteric and the
African dancer were awe-inspiring, repulsive to some, and sexually
exciting to nearly all. The attraction of the Savage Woman in France
can be dated as far back as the beginning of the century with the
notoriety of Sartjie Baartman, the so-called Hottentot Venus. The
body of the Hottentot Venus was by far the most popularized image of
a black woman in the nineteenth century, from cartoons to the theater,
and the primitive sexual appetites of this black woman were supposedly
displayed most clearly by her buttocks, which constituted the primary
visual attraction when she was exhibited.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
In the vaudeville play, "The Hottentot Venus or the hatred of French
Women," the African woman performs a song and dance routine which is
"a little grotesque." Nonetheless, this image of Woman did not become
a <i>staple</i> of popular entertainment until the 1870s with the
Epileptic Singers. Why? The two reasons were the tremendous popular
interest in Darwinism <i>and</i> in Charcot's hysterics. (<a name="1"
href="10.4gordon_res.html#1"> 1</a>) The text, "Darwin!,"
by Louis de Gramont that accompanies this 1878 drawing by Andr&eacute;
Gill informs readers that "there are few people among the general public
who don't know the name of Darwin, and his ideas are summarized in
one sentence: 'man descends from the ape.'" Darwin himself is jokingly
rumored to be rehearsing for his debut at the circus. We read: "Where
will the magnificence of the Hippodrome end? They're talking about
hiring the celebrated Darwin who would come to furnish the proof of his
genealogy by exhibiting the prestigious agility that he inherited from
his forefathers (the monkeys).&#8212;M. Littr&eacute;, who shares his
faith and the ancestors of the English savant, will assist him in his
exercises." The drawing by Andr&eacute; Gill shows the naturalist jumping
through a hoop called "Credulity," while the author of the dictionary,
Littr&eacute;, holds the second hoop labeled "Superstitions, Errors,
Ignorance." Their heads are on the bodies of orangutans.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
The fascination with the hysterical body's uncontrollable epileptic
contortions coalesced with the fascination for the excess of agitated
movement in African dance. In both cases, the attraction is to the
"animalistic" and the "savage." As Marianna Torgovnick has written,
the primitive is represented as "libidinous, irrational, violent, and
dangerous," res of our own "wild selves" and unconscious drives.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
The characteristics attributed to the primitive are the same
traits assigned to female hysterics in the nineteenth-century,
a correspondence that Sander Gilman has examined in the context of
medicine and criminology. Popular spectacle played a powerful role in
creating, reinforcing, or changing these stereotypes. The Other may
well be the secret self of taboos, of hidden desire, but thanks to
the nineteenth-century media, the spectacular bodies of the Other are
hypervisible. The convergence of primitivism with the connections forged
between neurosis and modernity in the fin de si&egrave;cle suggests that

<b></b>

we situate the emergence of modernity squarely in the cabaret aesthetic
of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, an aesthetic penetrated
by contemporary psychiatric and biological definitions of Low.
<p>
The belly dance first enthralled and scandalized spectators at the 1889
Exposition Universelle, with the vogue for Spanish dancing following
close behind; among the exotic dancers performing in Paris were la
Belle Otero, Mata Hari, Colette and her intimate friend, Polaire. Along
with Mistinguett, Polaire rose to stardom as an Epileptic Singer,
and her popularity eclipsed that of Mistinguett until around 1910. A
close look at Polaire reveals an underlying association with racial
stereotypes, an important, but now lost, component of her appeal&#8212;an
association with not only African women who were exhibited in Paris
in the nineteenth-century, not only with photographs and drawings
of African women that appeared in popular, middlebrow, and highbrow
magazines, but also with black American entertainers beginning with
touring minstrel shows and culminating in the explosion of a new dance
rage in 1902: the Cake-Walk. To what extent did white singers and dancers
incorporate black traits? Were their motives simply exploitative, or was
there a conscious or unconscious identification with black Americans
or Africans? Some answers should emerge in re-examining performances,
memoirs, and interviews. I begin, then, with Polaire's predecessors and
fellow Epileptic Singers, as well as with the African dancers who shared
the spotlight in the same period.
<p>
As noted in <i>Why the French love Jerry Lewis</i>, "nothing was more
modern, more fashionable between 1880 and 1900 than nervous pathology,
whose jerky rhythms and movements define popular song and performance
style in the period."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
In the present

<b></b>

essay, I want first to focus on aspects of the ugly and grotesque that
coincided with the representation of nervous pathology. In 1886, Maurice
Vaucaire called the caf&eacute;-concert "the spectacle of the ugly,
of the obscene, and of the grotesque. . . . it makes one stupid [but]
this idiotic neurosis has its charm."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Another commentator had a more pessimistic view of the deleterious
effects of the caf&eacute;-concert: "we no longer have simply the
caf&eacute;-concert with its raucous and slightly mad familiarity,
but now the <i>caf&eacute;-cancer</i> with its hideous and stinking
leprosy that eats away at us, that devours our society and that threatens
. . . to make our members fall off in putrefaction."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
As emphasized in <i>Why the French love Jerry Lewis</i>, if the cabaret
and caf&eacute;-concert were low culture, that had to do as much
with their direct appeal to the body as it did with the proportion of
working-class spectators in the audience. The aesthetic categories of
High and Low take on an unsuspected perspective when one takes into
account psychological theories of the lower faculties (sensory-motor
functions, automatisms, instinct) that were so widely disseminated in
the period. Songs like "Nervous," "Too Nervous," "Tata's Tic," and "La
Parisienne &eacute;pileptique" were sung by Epileptic Singers, while
"Peas," "The Hole in my Quai" and "I'm a Neurasthenic" were sung by
Idiot Comics like Dranem and Darius M. They were preceded by Paulus, who
invented the genre of the Agitated Singer in 1870. Andr&eacute; Chadourne
wrote in 1889 that "the public is thirsty for these songs . . . it can't
get enough. And cases of pathology like this are met with more often
than one would think" (<i>LCC</i>, 277). These performers, along with
many others in the last quarter of the nineteenth-century in France,
modeled their performance style on the tics, grimaces, contortions, and
convulsive movements and gestures of epileptics and hysterics. Thanks to
phenomenal media attention on hysteria, the great majority of spectators
recognized this source. The extraordinary popularity of Epileptic Singers
and Idiot Comics exactly coincided with the startling rise in cases
of hysteria in Parisian hospitals, feeding into and capitalizing on a
cultural phenomenon which was just getting underway. It is not by chance
that the style fell out of fashion in France in 1907, at around the same
time that Charcot's spectacular version of hysteria was supplanted by
that of Babinski, and hysterics were no longer being exhibited at the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. One of Charcot's successors, D&eacute;jerine,
boasted that the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re hysterics' ward was as quiet
as a monastery. In fact, the epileptiform attack no longer occurred and
actors and singers thus no longer found it of interest to visit and to
observe gesture. The journalist Georges Montorgueil was only one of many
to point to the relationship with hysteria. He wrote, "A good half of
today's hit songs . . . belong to the late Dr. Charcot's jiggling pit for
the agitated. They jerk and tremble. They have gesticulatory hysteria."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Conversely, the theatrical exhibitions of specialists in nervous
pathology inspired analogies with agitated caf&eacute;-concert singers:
Dr. Luys and three colleagues demonstrating the effects of hypnotic
suggestion are compared to "Paulus . . . presenting his most hysterical
women." Indeed, the hysterical subject Esther begins to sing an air
from an operetta when Luys approaches.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
In its restructuring of the body, hysteria became a cultural phenomenon
and created a new form of expression in the arts. More precisely,
the theme of hysteria in popular entertainment produced a novel form
of spectacle. Contained in the unpretentious but nonetheless

<b></b>

extraordinary modernity of this new form of spectacle were the seeds of
Futurism, Dada, and Surrealism.
<p>
For the last quarter of the century, the
<i>chanteuse&eacute;pileptique</i> was one of the biggest draws in
Parisian night-life. The genre was created by Emilie B&eacute;cat at the
Ambassadeurs in the summer of 1875. For the novelist, J.-K. Huysmans,
Mlle B&eacute;cat is "that epileptic doll bleating and twisting her hips
in those inept convulsions that made her a quasi-celebrity." Huysmans
goes on to describe singers who remind him of La B&eacute;cat: they
hold out their "paws" in front of them "that bob up and down like the
imbecilic paws of porcelain monkeys."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Mlle B&eacute;cat was the first (but not the last) Epileptic Singer
to call forth a comparison with the simian species. Her costume as
well as her movements would be imitated by a host of scantily-clothed
young women. The most famous of them was Polaire, "the agitating
and agitated Polaire . . . in a blouse tight enough to bring on the
spasm (of orgasm) . . . the big, voracious mouth. . . . that face of
a ghoul and of Salome. . . . What a coffee grinder and what a belly
dance! . . . Polaire hops around, trembles, quivers, dances with her
hips, pelvis, and navel, mimes all forms of shocks and shaking."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Singers routinely used the word "epilepsy" to describe their style:
when Mistinguett adopted a new persona, she explained that she "was
tired of the daily epilepsy." I have described this performance style
in detail elsewhere.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Here, I want to show that under the clowning and the frothy white
petticoats there was more than a little of darkest Africa. (.<a name="2" href="10.4gordon_res.html#2"> 2</a>-<a name="3" href="10.4gordon_res.html#3">3</a>)

3 The Ugly
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The <i>chanteuse &eacute;pileptique</i> created a style of sexual lewdness
combined with clowning and extreme corporeal contortions and grimaces:
the creation of a female grotesque, to use Mary Russo's term.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Montorgueil wrote that they were "so stupefying, so unexpected! And what
clown-like poses!" Some even adopted the clown's hairstyle with a point
at the top, the same hairstyle that could also be seen on minstrels
performing in Paris. "With the contortions of a strangling chicken,
a woman . . . bleated out a popular song."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
The "nervous" gommeuse, Foscolo, "was not afraid . <i>. . to be
ridiculous, to make herself ugly</i>."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Ugliness made singers distinctive and gave them great physical
presence. Similarly, the can-can dancers led by Nini-les-Pattes-en-l'air
"wagered on an exhibition that is the funniest in terms of ugliness."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Even Yvette Guilbert was obliged to magnify ugliness and freakishness to
draw attention in the beginning, "the bad days when I did my 'Brunin'
number, a horrible pointed wig on my skull. You have to be brave to
disre yourself like that: . . . me, the more I'm ridiculous, the
happier I am."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
(The Phenomenon, Brunin, was an uncommonly tall, emaciated man who
danced in a tutu.) "Mlle Abdala, taking advantage of her exceptionally
skinny physique, made the grimace into an art form."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Montorgeuil wrote that Mlle Abdala was "ahead of her time." Not only
was she "a rascally parody of woman, . . . she uses her charm to make
herself ugly," but if one day, singers decide to exploit "a special
distinctive ugliness" in the manner of Black musicians and dancers,

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 624]</b>

then Mlle Abdala "will be a star of the first magnitude."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
The <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> published a long poem on Mlle Abdala
in 1893.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[She is] a miracle, a prodigy, an artist. She's not like the other
singers that you see everywhere. No. She is a lot rarer, certainly more
<i>bizarre</i>. More than that, if you like, <i>barbarous</i>. Here she
is on stage: it's an apparition that surprises and troubles you, then
hypnotizes your attention. When I saw this crazy woman I thought I was
seeing [something supernatural]. With cynicism and candor, forgetting that
she's a woman, she triples her <i>ugliness</i>. She tortures the mask of
her face, she makes herself as <i>horrible</i> as she can; she ignites
the desire for some fantastic witches' Sabbath. Her neck stretches out,
the head floats above it, the arms resemble <i>the paws of an animal</i>
or anything else you want them to resemble. <i>Her eyes bug out</i>
and <i>hermouth grows bigger to such a point that she can put herfist
into this fearful pit</i>. It is Beauty in Deformity and in excess,
the enormous comedy of <i>lugubriousgaiety</i>.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What Montorgueil saw in Mlle Abdala's ugliness was her resemblance
to the black minstrels who were stealing the spotlight in the fin de
si&egrave;cle; Ponchon's vocabulary reiterates and elaborates on the
analogy, but also underlines the singer's status as prodigy. Prodigy
is the English term for the French "Phenomenon," a category of
performer that will take on new meaning in the wake of Darwinism. The
genre included Siamese twins, giants, midgets, hunchbacked singers,
emaciated comics like Brunin, and the P&eacute;tomane, all of whom
performed in the nineteenth-century caf&eacute;-concert. The taste
for Phenomena existed before the advent of Darwinism in France;
already in 1851 the caf&eacute;-chantant le Grand Concert des Arts,
precursor to the caf&eacute;-concert, hired giants to sing. "Limp,
be one-eyed, extraordinarily thin, fat to bursting, and, in addition,
sing . . . [and] you'll easily earn 1,200 francs a month." The genre
of<i>Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne</i> was at times indistinguishable from
the genre of freak.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
In an 1867 article entitled "Women Phenomena," an outraged journalist
excoriates the American and English equestrian stars, Adah Isaacs
Mencken and Cora Pearl, predicting that this taste for women who were
not only joined to a horse, but whose sexuality was on exhibit would
lead to "Italians climbing a greased pole, which brings us to Lapps and
Hottentots, we will come to that. . . . acrobats, tightrope walkers,
horse-women . . . women with two heads, androgynes, monsters, this is
what we need."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The amalgam of Phenomena and Hottentots should not surprise us: in fact,
performing Africans and black Americans were often viewed as Phenomena,
and it will be important to look at this effect on white singers who
adopted black characteristics.
<p>
The attraction to ugliness is not present solely in popular culture,
but is, of course, an extremely important characteristic of decadent
literature of the last two decades of the century; it is found in
middle-brow magazines as well. In the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>
of 15 August 1897, a prose piece entitled "Ideal Ugliness" delineates the
"peculiar aesthetics brought about by the love of the unexpected and the
horror of banality." A fin-de-si&egrave;cle Parisian is searching for "an
ideally ugly mistress," one in whom a sort of harmony and an irresistible
attraction would emanate from a hideous face." The woman who meets this
description is Darwinesque: "she singularly pleased him by the unexpected

<b></b>

expressions that her simian physiognomy took on, running the gamut of
the different sensations she felt. . . . instead of a lovely smile,
she had a ferocious sneer and contortions of the cheeks." He loves her
"receding forehead, without a brain."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Desire is aroused in women as well; a short piece entitled "The Lover
who makes you Laugh" describes the attraction of "a pretty performer,
a bit crazy," for a comic in a second-rung theater whose grimaces are
rewarded by her kisses. "He is ugly, and yet his physiognomy has nothing
displeasing about it; he resembles a monkey more than a man."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
The ugliness of the singer Mademoiselle Abdala, the contortions of
singers like Paulus and Eloi Ouvrard, and the brainless look of idiot
comics like Dranem were part and parcel of an aesthetics of ugliness,
itself enriched by the fascination surrounding Darwinism. If more proof
of the attraction of this constellation in popular spectacle is wanted,
one could cite a review of Ouvrard by Jean d'Arc: "He's a skinny little
man with . . . no stomach and an unfinished thorax, pointed knees,
angular arms; oh! there are angles everywhere on this runt's body,
something automatic in his gestures. . . . <i>a face that is admirably
simian</i>, crazily planted on top of a package of nerves."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, new forms of the grotesque&#8212;always a magnetic element
in popular spectacle from the Middle Ages on&#8212;re-emerged in
the mid-nineteenth-century as the allure of ugliness in singers and
comics. Minstrels were able to capitalize on this fascination in the
1880s. In fact, black minstrels and the black-face genre dubbed "Les
Exotiques" were becoming so popular with audiences that the journalist
Montorgueil predicted they might one day triumph and singers disappear
(see below). His assessment would prove to be right on the money, as
will become clear when we discover how eagerly white musical singers
seized upon the association with blackness that became part of their
aura. Despite the d&eacute;collet&eacute;, the lavish display of
undergarments and the sexual content of the songs, the erotic appeal of
some of the singers is, as we see, at best a curious one. This essay will
suggest that the attraction of the erotic fused with the comic, extending
even to a delight in ugliness, was at the heart of the popularity of
both black entertainers and of the Epileptic Singers. Certainly, it is
the attraction of novelty. Yet its pleasures are riskier than simply
experiencing the new.
<p>
The mixture of contorted corporeal poses, comical grimaces, and unabashed
sexuality in lyric, movement, and dress may be difficult to understand
today. It had certainly never been seen before on stage. However, if the
combination of grotesque comedy and eroticism was new to the stage, the
very same mix existed in the hysterical attacks of a great many female
patients at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re Hospital. An 1878 case history
of a hysteric describes her curious attack of hysterical chorea:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The face grimaces horribly, [resumes its ordinary expression, and
grimaces again . . . She gets up, walks around dragging her leg and]
then begins the habitual jolts and shaking. Her left leg contracts
and the entire member is taken over by a stamping movement. Finally,
she suffers a fit of manic agitation where she laughs without reason,
gesticulates, jumps and dances. The next day, she is taken over by a
mad fury consisting of grimaces, sticking out her tongue, and bizarre
poses that change every instant."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Chorea, a dance-like mania involving chronic agitation of the members, was
associated with hystero-epilepsy beginning in 1878, just three years after
Emilie B&eacute;cat created the genre of the chanteuse &eacute;pileptique,
and case observations of hysterics and epileptics with chorea in the
<i>Iconographie photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re</i> (such
as the one just cited) and in the <i>Nouvelle Iconographie</i> could
easily have served to describe the performances of those singers. "In
jumping chorea, patients jump in rhythmic fashion, absolutely as though
they were dancing."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Pierre Janet's hysterical patient Rose sings and takes a little bow
after her attack of chorea: "She was a caf&eacute;-concert singer
[before her confinement at the hospital] and she probably thinks that
she's on stage, for she sings very funny little songs for us."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Conversely, Jane Avril was a patient at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
before becoming a star of the Moulin Rouge.
<p>
The can-can, in the view of many commentators also replicates
hyst&eacute;ro-epilepsy. For Jules Claretie, "This epilepsy is to dance
itself what the hideous couplet shouted from the depths of filthy dives
is to song. And it becomes even more atrocious when the epileptic is
a female dancer. Out of Woman's charm, this crazed abandon makes a
hard-to-qualify unhealthy stamping and bizarre bonelessness that recall
the attacks of nervous disease in that period of shaking and convulsions
that science itself has named the period of clownism." He asks, "What
has all this can-can flesh become? In what concierge loges, in what
corners of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re do these quadrille dancers drag
themselves along?"
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
In 1899, novelists and journalists were still comparing the can-can
to hystero-epilepsy. After describing the annual Ball of Madwomen and
Hysterics at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, Georges Montorgueil writes,
"The real Mad Ball is at the Moulin-Rouge, when the quadrille led by
Rayon d'or or la Goulue unleashes that hystero-epilepsy that female
clowns translate into the indecent skirt-raising [of the can-can]."

<p>
Dancing itself was far from being considered an innocent corporeal
expression, and in the 1870s, alienists insisted on the relationship of
dance to hysteria.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Dr. Paul-Max Simon wrote in 1877 that "one put one's nervous system
in unison with the jiggling and stamping of the music of Offenbach,
and one invariably became hysterical and sometimes insane."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The theory of unconscious imitation to which the psychiatrist's
hyperbolic observation is indebted drew on experiments in psycho-physical
stimulus response and experiments in hypnotic suggestion; the unconscious
impulse to imitate directional forces and gesture, psychiatrists
concluded, came from the unconscious. This theory continued to hold
sway in the popular imagination in the early twentieth century. A 1907
song entitled "La Cin&eacute;matomagite," interpreted by the epileptic
comic, Darius M., illustrates it in the context of early cinema:
"When I was employed in the cinema business [as a projectionist],
I quickly caught a strange illness. As a result of watching the films
jiggle and tremble, I can't stop myself from fidgeting; something in
me continually dances. I have ci-ci-ci cinematomagitate. From head to
rump I feel the vibrations. . . . it's the nerves at work."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The effects of this pathology are sexual: "when

<b></b>

I see a [woman's] calf, I can't stay still; my cane stands up from bottom
to top." As is most often the case, the uncontrollable movements inspired
by popular spectacle are tied to libidinous sexual behavior.
<p>
A year after Dr. Simon published the above observation, Parisians were
exposed to several strange new dance exhibitions. As indicated earlier,
1878 was a capital year for

<b></b>

dance and, as a result, for concerns about contagion: it was the year
of the first Exposition Universelle to exhibit an officially sanctioned
African village and to showcase African dancing.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
It was the year that Zulus first danced on Music Hall stages at the
Folies-Berg&egrave;re.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
It also saw the first crest of popularity of the Epileptic Singer,
and it was the first time that case observations of chorea appeared in
the <i>Iconographie photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re ,</i>
then in its second year of publication.
<p>
Concurrently with the appearance of minstrels in France, beginning in
1877, large numbers of Parisians came to the Jardin d'acclimatation to see
the "African Villages," a scientifically endorsed ethnological exhibit.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
The first of these exhibits presented fourteen "Nubians" who had been
transported from Africa along with a number of exotic animals. "Paris
always needs a special attraction. Right now, its curiosity is vividly
transported to the Jardin d'acclimatation."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
This "special attraction," as the journalist writing in
<i>L'Illustration</i> called it, fed Parisians' curiosity with the
spectacle of a group of people going about their daily activities. Their
physical characteristics, their dress and their habits seemed
extraordinarily uncivilized to the casual observer, whose impressions
were soon confirmed by anthropologists. Soon, to add to the thrill of
the attraction, mating rituals and cannibalism were mimed as part of the
ethnological exhibits. Initially sanctioned as scientific, they became
more and more theatrical and commercialized. The "Amazons" of Dahomey
were first brought to Paris in 1891; 800,000 visitors came to see the
tableaux vivants at the Jardin reenacting the fierce battle that French
forces waged against the warriors defending Abomey. A small number of
women fought alongside the men: they were soon to achieve mythic status
as Amazons. West Africans were in fact only presented to the French
"after the exhibits . . . were turned into circus spectacles. The
consequence was that, following the lead of illustrated magazines, the
ethnographic exhibits made certain to show West Africans in a spectacular
and sensational decor. The accent was put on their bizarre costumes,
their ferocity and their savagery in order to attract and entertain
the crowds."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
The exotic animals in captivity displayed alongside the villagers were
not the only unflattering juxtaposition. "Monsters"&#8212;dwarfs and
giants&#8212;were also exhibited at the Jardin d'acclimatation. As
mentioned before, they had already been popular acts in the
caf&eacute;-concert for some time. In fact, among the scientific
studies published in the first issue (in 1873) of the <i>Bulletin of
the Anthropological Society of Paris</i> was Cl&eacute;mence Royer's
study of the so-called Russian Dog-Man and his son (father and son
were exhibited in Barnum's touring circus). The convergence of science
and popular spectacle of course continued into the twentieth century,
with scientists in the fledgling fields of anthropology and criminology
capitalizing on the presence in France of Africans and of physically
different individuals.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
The 1909 exhibit and performance of dwarfs in the Jardin d'acclimatation
furnishes a good example: not only did popular weekly magazines devote
articles and photographs to the exhibit, but the Anthropological Society
of Paris also published an article comparing the dwarfs to Pygmies who
were previously on exhibit. Simultaneously, an article in <i>Comoedia</i>
jokes about the famous criminal anthropologist Alphonse Bertillon rushing
to the Jardin to make anthropometric measurements of the dwarfs' members.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
The attraction of bodily otherness was paramount

<b></b>

in nineteenth-century entertainment, and in the latter part of the century
the attractions based on this appeal were tied to the fears surrounding
the physical malformations and mental deficits of Degeneration.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
With the advance of Darwinism (<i>The Descent of Man</i> was translated
into French in 1872), Haeckel's idea quickly gained ground: for centuries,
in the development of species only the lower forms of mental activity
had existed, and the higher forms were had recently evolved.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
As cases of hysteria and degeneration multiplied, prehistoric
craniums were compared to the craniums of microcephalics and
imbeciles. Evolutionary regression and nervous pathology were not
only considered to be related, but one was sometimes even mistaken
for the other. If, to the average French spectator, the agitation of
"primitive" peoples resembled that of epileptics and hysterics, the
fact that "savages" were major attractions in the same period as the
Epileptic Singers and minstrels no doubt contributed to the assimilation
of hysteria and black performers in the popular imagination. Finally,
a confusion existed in physical anthropology between the craniums
of prehistoric humans and contemporary peoples such as Africans
and Australians. As early as 1888, the secretary-general of the
Anthropological Society of Paris, Paul Topinard, had written in <i>La
Nature</i> that races such as Australian aborigines and Hottentots were
soon to become extinct because of their inability to adapt. Soon after
this article appeared, his reconstitution of primitive life at the 1889
Universal Exposition attempted to demonstrate that contemporary "savage
and barbarous races are the same humans as our European ancestors."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
This confusion also found a home in the theater, as the skull of
a present-day Australian was given a hierarchical place in a row of
skulls presented at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Antoine in 1908 (the year
that the so-called Missing Link was discovered in central France).
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
A 1909 article in <i>Comoedia</i> by the creator of the exhibit at the
theater is worth citing.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every newspaper announced in 1908 that a Monkey-Man (<i>unhomme-singe</i>)
had just been discovered. . . . The Pithecanthropus . . . The missing
link. [The cranium] is perfectly equivocal: tiny indications of the simian
race are undisputable and, nonetheless, to cite M. Manouvrier (of the
Mus&eacute;e Dupuytren) . . . "it's a trueParisian brain!" . . . This
poor cousin who returns from his provincial backwaters after an exile
of <i>50 thousandyears</i> feels quite at home amidst our electric
luxury. . . . Does this discovery corroborate the theory of evolution
(<i>transformisme</i>) concerning the origins of man? . . . Mr. Boule
aligned . . . six craniums in the very same order that I exhibited them
attheTh&eacute;&acirc;treAntoine<b>,</b> that of a chimpanzee . . . then,
in order of merit, Java, Neanderthal, Chapelle-aux-Saints, present-
day Australian, and Homo Sapiens. The orthodox refuse to believe that
there is a missing link. When shown a cranium, they cry: "A degenerate!"
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the scientific search for the missing link was of such keen
interest to the general public that even the craniums became a theatrical
attraction. Judging from the brain, Parisians weren't that far removed
from monkeys after all, particularly Parisians who were afflicted with
Degeneration. Perhaps this explains the extraordinary success of so
many performing chimpanzees in Parisian music-halls. The year that the
missing link was discovered in France, the Grand-Guignol "Theater of Fear"
staged the comedy

<b></b>

"The Little Baboon" and Mistinguett brought her pet monkey on stage,
eliciting the kind of hilarious laughter that she herself had garnered
when she was a chanteuse &eacute;pileptique. The chimpanzees "Monsieur et
Madame X" were "frenetically applauded" at the Olympia in 1909. Darwin's
theory of evolution, more and more discussed in France and manipulated
to fit notions of social hierarchies, offered a scientific explanation
for white superiority. Physical anthropologists were eager to uncover
simian characteristics in Africans, beginning with Georges Cuvier's 1817
report published in the <i>M&eacute;moires du Mus&eacute;um</i>, a year
after the dissection of the body of Sartjie Baartmann, whose movements
the naturalist described as "brusque and capricious, recalling those of
a monkey. . . . She danced in the style of her country."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
In addition to the extraordinary popularity of the "ethnological
exhibits" described above, enormous crowds came to the 1878, 1889
and 1900 Expositions Universelles to see the natives of the Congo,
Dahomey, and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal perform songs and dances. In
1910, the movements of African dance continue to thrill spectators
and to elicit the same comparisons: "The tom-tom is father of
formidable leaps, of stupefying contortions, hilarious grimaces,
frenetic entrechats. . . . <i>The tom-tom is the synthesis of Negro
life</i>. . . . The lanky dancer crouches until he resembles a dwarf,
then he leaps, contorts himself, dislocates his body, grimaces . . . with
the gestures and grimaces of a monkey."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
A journalist in the magazine <i>Fantasio</i> writes that "In Africa,
lascivious dances to barbaric rhythms accompany the meeting of the
sexes. . . . Certain black women here and there are cannibals. But their
charm is only heightened by it, from what one says. . . ."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Posters foregrounding the bare-breasted Amazon warriors of Dahomey
served to advertize the hugely successful play "Au Dahomey" at the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Porte Saint-Martin in 1892. In 1893,
a spectacular show featuring 100 Dahomeyans and 25 Amazons was
presented at the Casino de Paris and attended by <i>2.7 million
spectators</i>, not counting those who went to see other Dahomey
extravaganzas at the wax museum and at the circus. (<a name="5"
href="10.4gordon_res.html#5"> 5</a>) A book review of
<i>The Man with the Glass Eye, Adventures in Dahomey</i> states that
"regrettable incidents have attracted the attention of all French people
to this part of the big, mysterious continent."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
So it was that highly sexualized savages and cannibals populated the
imaginations of the French in the 1880s through the first decade of the
twentieth century. What spectators savored, according to many accounts,
was the amount of flesh bared and the frenzied movements, and this was in
strict parallel to the attraction of the chanteuse &eacute;pileptique. It
should be noted that the spectacle of African Amazons (as well as the
1893 exhibition of Achantis in the Jardin d'acclimatation) coincided
in time with Polaire's rise to fame between 1890 and 1895.

5 Black Venus / White Venus
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
It is 1908: the combination of undress, "excessive movement," agitation,
and obscene gyrations&#8212;previously associated with Epileptic Singers
and now firmly meshed with African dancers and the fantasies surrounding
African women&#8212;is still very much in demand on Paris stages. "A
fashion has taken over, the fashion of the nude. Little by little,
our artists appeared barely belted from the navel to the hips, in the
fashion of

<b></b>

Negresses. . . . painfully contorting themselves. And then another variety
of nude was dreamed up . . . she . . . who presents herself like meat
on the rack. Even the loincloth of the Negro is discarded.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
It is the African woman who springs to mind whenever contorted and
sexual movement is combined with the naked female body. In addition to
characterizations as obscene or animalistic, descriptions of the acts of
Epileptic Singers in the 1890s when the style was at its peak contain
striking analogies to portraits of Africans or black Americans in the
same period. Journalists focus on the singers' "<i>big nostrils</i>"
and big mouth as well as on their <i>d&eacute;colletage</i>and the fact
that they are <i>" d&eacute;-cul-ot&eacute;e on the bottom .</i>"
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Naya is "<i>a little animal</i> with a chignon"; Vanoni possesses "the
<i>furious grace of the American</i>, the gymnastic pantomime of this
<i>unleashed Fury</i>owes something to the Hanlon-Lees."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
She is "<i>The Agitated One</i>."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Can-can dancers, too, carried associations with black women: Andr&eacute;
Chadourne wanted to "stop those horrifying exhibitions of women found
in the worst gutters . . . these Goulues, these Grilles-d'&eacute;gout

<b></b>

who dance on the French stage the kind of dance steps that are unknown
even to the lowest form of savages" (<i>LCC</i>, 311).
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
The commercial attraction of obscenity&#8212;or at the very least, of
sexual provocation&#8212;was central to the Epileptic Singers' rise to
fame as it was to the popularity of the can-can, and it is no less central
to the draw of African women in the eyes of the media. The chanteuse
&eacute;pileptique successfully embodies and capitalizes on Otherness:
loss of control in epilepsy and hysteria, the behavior and language
of a prostitute. Like Africans, they were labeled "animalistically
aggressive." Even in the 1930s, Mistinguett was singing, "I'm looking
for a millionaire, and that's why I walk the boulevards." When she finds
him, she sings, "now kiss me. Harder, still harder, a kiss <i>&agrave;
la cannibale</i>!"
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Yet, singers perform in a way that is grotesque and <i>comical</i>
enough to make the frightening aspects palatable. Later, Josephine
Baker would temper the "man-eating" threat of the highly sexualized
"black savage" by crossing her eyes.
<p>
Scientific theories about sexual deviance were rife in the nineteenth
century, and often preposterous. Sartje Bartman's genitalia, covered by
a loincloth, were the focus of countless fantasies and rumored to be
strangely extended like an apron. Scientific studies of the genitalia
supposedly established links between the sexuality of the black woman,
the lesbian and the prostitute, as well as implying freakishness and
bestiality.
<p>
A large painting of a Hottentot woman occupies a very prominent place at
the entrance to Topinard's exhibit in the 1889 Exposition Universelle;
it attests the persistence of the image of the Hottentot Venus 75
years after her death in France. At the end of the nineteenth century,
Cesare Lombroso again pointed out the analogy between the physical
characteristics of Hottentots and prostitutes.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
Zola's heroine, the courtisan Nana, became an overnight star in
her role as the Blond Venus, a name that would automatically evoke
her predecessor, the Black Venus. Indeed, the play "La V&eacute;nus
noire" was having a successful run at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du
Ch&acirc;telet in 1878; <i>Nana</i> was published in installments in
1879-80. Even if this role was clearly modeled on Offenbach's "La
Belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne," there exists, nonetheless, the echo I
am suggesting.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
One indication that the Blond and Black Venus remained tied as
complementary opposites in French minds is offered in the person of one
of the only music-hall performers to rival Polaire in popularity. La
Belle Otero, known primarily for her Spanish dances, but who did not
hesitate to dance the Cake-Walk, opened the 1903 season in a play
called "Dream of Opium." In it, she is a "wild Venus (<i>V&eacute;nus
fauve</i>) with a black mane and powerful arms, savage, but Goddess
nevertheless." The reviewer salutes her "terrible voluptuousness" that
does not possess the beauty of the blond Venus, but rather "the robust,
crude, and powerful beauty . . . that destroys and creates."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
The unbridled sexuality of the prostitute,"an atavistic form of humanity"
according to writers like Lombroso, is a regression to a primitive
stage of evolutionary development, just like the hysteric's.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
"The links between prostitution, madness, and hysteria were fundamental
in contemporary writing on prostitution," according to Alain Corbin.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
One of these links was the loss of control represented by unleashed
sexuality; another was the "love of dancing" characteristic of
degenerates and of savages.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
Charles Bernheimer has written that "hysterics on display at the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re were the prime

<b></b>

stimulus for many of the male fantasies about female sexuality previously
projected onto prostitutes."
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
We need to add that that stimulus was matched by the gaze that was
focused on African women.

6 Chocolat and Chocolates
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In a 1909 Revue at the Olympia, Foottit played an American impresario
who comes to Paris to "steal" the stars of the music-hall away from
Paris. The American is accompanied by "his wife, a N&eacute;gresse,
agile as a monkey (played by Chocolat) and his son, a fantastical dwarf."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Black Americans are in fact stealing the show from Parisian stars, and
their popularity in music-halls is mirrored by other bizarre or unusual
performers such as dwarfs and monkeys. Minstrels were so popular that
the word was included among the 45 English words every French person
absolutely needed to know in case of an British invasion, along with
water-closet, music-hall, and Darwin's baby.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>

<p>
The most famous black performer of the period was the clown
Chocolat. Willy's friend Curnonsky called Foottit's side-kick (emphasis on
kick) "Foottit's <i>shadow</i>, the inseparable Chocolat." Jean Cocteau
described him as a "stupid Negro in tight black silk pants . . . serving
as a pretext for blows."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
Most often seen in the company of his white partner, Foottit, Chocolat's
celebrity nevertheless exceeded the bounds of the comic numbers the
pair performed at the Nouveau Cirque. His elegance and grace outside
of the circus act can be seen in Toulouse-Lautrec's 1896 lithograph,
"Chocolat Dancing in a Bar." In 1894, Chocolat was already "legendary
[and] the favorite amuser of the crowds" for the theater critic of the
<i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, Jean D'Arc.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<p>
Could Chocolat make women's hearts beat faster? A little
tale by Jules Renard entitled "Pierre et Berthe" answers in the
affirmative. Ten-year-old Berthe announces to nine-year-old Pierre that
she wants to marry Chocolat. Pierre: "He wouldn't want you." Berthe:
"But I want him." P: "It's forbidden for a white woman to marry a black
man. People on the street would say: You see that little girl, she's the
wife of a Negro!" B: "I don't care, because I love him." P: "Why do you
love him instead of Footitt?" (sic) B: "Because he doesn't wear a wig
or make-up. I love him, I love him." P: "He doesn't love you." . . . B:
"He already loves me because he gave me some chocolates." P: "Chocolat
gave you chocolates because you were at the circus. He gives them to
everyone. . . . At the circus, yes, he's very nice, but not in town. In
town, a Negro is always mean." When Pierre accuses Berthe of being a
gourmande (a glutton), she exclaims, "You imagine that I want to eat
him like a chocolate candy?"
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Little Berthe is naive, but she correctly interprets Pierre's insult. The
correlation between Chocolat, chocolates, and&#8212;as we will have
occasion to verify&#8212;Africans selling chocolates clearly has to
do with fantasies about cannibalism. Better to eat than be eaten by a
black man, as the chocolates in the form of black babies sold in America
not so many decades ago remind us. If we look at the advertisements
that Willette drew for the candy manufacturer Pihan, we can see 
Chocolat himself presenting them,  a Pierrot licking the hand and
arm of a lovely and scantily-attired African woman and saying: "It's
Pihan chocolate," and  a drawing that is very much along the same
lines as the story of

<b></b>

little Berthe. A black Pierrot perched on a box with a palm-tree decor,
dangles chocolate hearts in front of adorable little French girls
(of around 6 to 10 years old) who are jumping up, trying to catch the
chocolates in their mouths! One little girl has fallen over, landing
in a position that very much resembles a sexual posture often found in
Willette's drawings of cocottes; the bug-eyed stare of the black clown
would seem to confirm this interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
The chocolate hearts, like romantic black men, are bait for innocent
young French girls. A monkey descending from the palm tree is juxtaposed
to the black man.
<p>
Laughing at black people amounts to a national pastime, and it defuses
the threat represented by black virility. But what about <i>black</i>
laughter? In this drawing, it is just as threatening and frightening as
the white fantasies about sexual virility and cannibalism that made it
necessary to ridicule blacks.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
(<a name="6" href="10.4gordon_res.html#6"> 6</a>) Like
the description of the mouth in the poem "Boumboum" below, the gleaming
white teeth of this laughing mouth seem ready to bite and devour. Perhaps
black laughter <i>was</i> angry; a French review of black dancers in
America emphasizes the "Negro's ability to find every opportunity to
grimace with his comical face," at the same time describing this face as
"mark[ing] the transition from man to gorilla." The 1910 article begins
with a condemnation of lynching in America, 500 or 600 in any given year:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
it's a solution to the Black menace. . . . Lynching and beating has
even lost its savor for their demanding taste; the Negro is now burned
at the stake. The Negro continues nevertheless to thumb his nose
at hisexecutioner with a childlike insouciance and the swagger of a
schoolboy's tricks which is not without its grandeur [in this] country
where the struggle for life takes on the somber aspect of murderous
grappling, the Negro, with his face of soot broken by the white flash
of his teeth and his mocking eyes, would seem to represent the only real
gaiety of the United States. The Negro is smiling.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Selling chocolates is an acceptable way for black men to make a living
in Paris&#8212;as long as they are not too successful. If so, they again
constitute a threat. In Raoul Ponchon's poem, "Boumboum," the "Negro
of the Esplanade" sells candies he imports from Africa. He is "starved
for lucre" as "he calls out, 'Boumboum' and . . . reveals a terrible maw
that glimmers like lightning in a black night. Boumboum! That is to say,
bon-bon, I think. Boumboum, shouts Bamboula, opening a savage oven,
so wide that you say to yourself: he's going to fall into his own mouth."
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
The merchant's gaping maw threatens to devour the Parisians around
him. This is the same gaping maw that we saw in the depiction of Mlle
Abdala. The unconscious connection between black men, chocolates,
and cannibalism could hardly be clearer. But the fear is economic
and social as well, for he is swallowing up profits that used to be
made by Parisians. And, even worse, his success opens the flood gates
of African immigration. The only hope is to make Africans themselves
into products for Parisian consumers. Thus, at the end of the poem,
all these Africans invading Paris are called "exotic products."
<p>
The black mouth also amazed spectators when Hicks' Georgia Minstrels
toured Australia and New Zealand in 1877. A reviewer wrote that they
were "genuine delineators of the Ethiopian character as it is seen in
the United States of America, and as

<b></b>

such they are simply inimitable. . . . two of the gentlemen have mouths
which, when expanded, present an exhibition well worth the entrance
money alone, for every time they open them, they seem as if they were
trying to swallow their own heads. Nor is the company altogether weak
in the vocal line."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
Jean Lorrain's portrait of Polaire cited above draws attention to her
"big, voracious mouth." Polaire changed her name from Emilie-Marie
Bouchaud because she thought the name sounded too much like the name of
a Zolian character. One can regret the change, because it would be easy
to read "bouche chaude" (hot mouth) in her last name. During the second
Empire, the mouth of the greatest female star of the caf&eacute;-concert,
Th&eacute;r&eacute;sa, was also the focus of attention. She was the
only nineteenth-century female singer to have achieved the same degree
of popularity and notoriety as Polaire would. "Her mouth stretches all
the way around her head; for lips, the cushions of the Negro, and they
spew out the truffles found in the gutter." And the audience becomes
her mirror: "The animal maw [of the public] has to be fed on rotten meat
from now on."
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
She was also linked to the theme of freakishness: her biggest hit was
"The Bearded Lady."

7 Minstrels, The Cake-Walk, and the Black Menace
<!--_/a-head-->

<p>
In 1886, Maurice Vaucaire described the caf&eacute;-concert genre,
"Les Exotiques:"



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
English or Americans in black-face, in black tights, both agile and
heavy. Heavy in order to impress the public who is thrilled when it
hears the stage boards resonate under their feet (and) their insane
pratfalls. Fists in the face, kicks in the pants, blows to the gut
and on the head! It makes them sweat, the poor devils, and the sweat
runs freely, taking off the sooty brown varnish that they've applied
to their face. Their white eyes, their white teeth give to this black
physiognomy an air of the good Negro. In this way they're as likeable
as they are terrifying.
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In 1895, "the Parisian minstrels in strange costumes . . . sing, play
the guitar, and give the impression of some tormented dream. We will no
doubt have the opportunity to come back to this bizarre, this disturbing
and amusing trio."
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
Black minstrels are "bizarre and disturbing, the "tormented dream" of a
white public, as well as amusing. But when the blows fly, the audience
exults. (<a name="7" href="10.4gordon_res.html#7"> 7</a>)
They are "burlesque . . . as Negroes know how to be."
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>

<p>
When, in 1893, Georges Montorgueil reflected on the longevity of the
minstrel genre, he recognized the family resemblances with other acts
that had won favor with the public <i>precisely because</i> they echoed
the bizarre appearance (or so-called ugliness) and the burlesque violence
of minstrel acts, violence "which always makes us rejoice." He surmised
that it would be the wave of the future.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
To satisfy this taste . . . the [caf&eacute;]-concert pads its repertoire
with fat-bellied clowns, familiar Englishmen . . . with tiny hats. . . whose teeth are broken and who fall with a loud bang. . . . We
must recognize, in the ability of these minstrels to keep themselves on
the programs of the summer caf&eacute;-concerts, an indication of the
programs of the future where this exhibition will occupy a place rivaling
songs. And maybe an hour will strike when the caf&eacute;-concert will
be a place without any concert at all. . . . The singer will come there
to exploit a special, distinctive ugliness like the musical Negroes,
and Mlle Abdala will be a star of the first magnitude.
<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
If one of the threats that black performers posed was to become so popular
as to threaten the disappearance of other caf&eacute;-concert genres,
then it was necessary to copy them. I want to show here that not only
did the <i>movements</i> of black entertainers influence white singers
and dancers, but their grimaces and perceived "ugliness" constituted an
attraction that also inspired white Epileptic Singers.
<p>
On 1 November 1902, an American troupe presented a new dance, one
which was to become what the French call "un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne de
soci&eacute;t&eacute;." That dance was the Cake-Walk.
<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
Introduced in the review <i>Les Joyeux N&egrave;gres</i> at the
Nouveau-Cirque by Mr. and Mrs. Elks and their troupe, the jerky,
syncopated rhythms of the Cake-Walk were described by Jean Cocteau: "They
danced: skinny, crooked, their . . . knees higher than their thrust-out
chins. . . . wrenching their gestures from themselves. . . . They reared,
they kicked, they broke themselves in two, three, four. . . . The
delirious public was on

<b></b>

its feet stamping. Never has a trendy spectacle composed of saltpeter,
not even the first jazz music accompanying the dances of Gaby Deslys
at the Casino de Paris, never has a spectacle been comparable to this
apparition."
<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
Note that Cocteau published this account a full decade after Josephine
Baker's Paris debut in 1925.
<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
The next years witnessed a veritable explosion of cake-walk-o-mania. (<A
NAME="8" href="10.4gordon_res.html#8"> 8</a>) At the
Ambassadeurs, Strit performed "La cakewalkomanie," Odette Auber sang
"Professeur de cakewalk," Anna Dancrey sang, "with his cakewalk he
charms me, my little Negro." "Uncle Tom" and "Black American" were sung
by Epileptic Singers and Foottit and Chocolat parodied the dance. The
mania was not limited to the stage. In 1903, several Cake-Walk films
were released. In a very brief period of time, however, the "elegance"
perceived by the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> journalist disappears
(it was, moreover, entirely overlooked by Cocteau in his 1935 memoir),
giving way to a vision of a backward slide to a prior stage of
evolution. Of the six American films of the dance held at the Library
of Congress, only one resembles the descriptions that can be read and
seen on film in France, the "Comedy Cake-Walk"; all the others are far
more elegant and restrained in movement.
<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
It would seem that Cake-Walk dancers in France quickly adapted their
performances to French expectations, expectations that one can only
surmise were the fruit of the African spectacles which had preceded
their arrival on French shores. The 1899 program for M. B. Curtis'
Afro-American Minstrels and Variety Company thus becomes more
comprehensible to us. After a "Lilliputian Creole Contortion Danseuse,"
"The Grand Cake Walk" is presented. "Participated in by 16 Devotees
of Delsarte, who stand ready to defend their claim as Champions on the
merits of Style, Grace and

Execution."

(Fran&ccedil;ois Delsarte [1811-1871] was a theorist and teacher of
drama and mimicry who put forth gestural language as the most direct
expression of the Soul.) Accordingly, the reviewer writes, "the Cake
Walk was a decided novelty, and the house was charmed by this unique
spectacle of Negro grace."
<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
In his report from New Orleans, Harry Tr&eacute;mont underlined the
difference I am pointing out: "the serious (solemn) cake-walk [is] not
one of these grotesque, meaningless contortions which were recently
an epidemic in our salons, but a real competition of elegance where
a cake is the prize." Yet, only a page later, the reporter reverts to
the commonplace perception, the one that governs French spectators. "The
eyes roll comically. . . . the couples begin to move. What an exhibition
of expertly clown-like graces! You're supposed to walk with elegance
[but] you would think they were cocks in heat. Moreover, they have an
irresistibly libidinous temperament. . . . then the rhythm accelerates
. . . frenetically [which] forces them to make incredible contortions."
<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
The implications of frenetic rhythm and the raw energy exhibited in
black bodies dancing the Cake-Walk, as we see, include not only physical
prowess but a "libidinous temperament." The latter is underlined in
the contemporary press on a remarkably frequent basis.

An elegant young Parisian couple, seated at a caf&eacute;, the man
haggard and fatigued, watch as a tall, proud Sudanese man walks by. This
is an advertizement for a pick-me-up that claims to be an antidote to
neurasthenia. The woman asks her companion: "Why don't <i>you</i> take
Kola Marque. It seems that it's thanks to Kola Marque that the Sudanese
and other exotics are so solid and vigorous."

In the 25 August 1900 issue of

<b></b>

<i>Le Rire</i>, a middle-aged Bourgeois returns home to find his wife
in bed with a black man. Both are startled and afraid, but the husband
exclaims: "Ah, so <i>you're</i> the Negro: please continue." In another
drawing, an elegant threesome is composed of a Parisienne with a black
man on each arm.
<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
Dangerous attraction, to say the least, judging from other drawings. An
African tribal chief tells a tall, young member of the tribe who is
handcuffed to a Parisian cocotte in lingerie and black stockings: "We
have all we need for now; we'll eat her when we're in the Sahara." An
African is dancing wildly in the background.
<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>
A poem by Raoul Mayence entitled "The Black Peril" sums up the fear
of black men: "Negroes prowl around your women in the Luxembourg
Gardens. . . . Perhaps their ambition is to subjugate and captivate
all of Paris."
<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>

<p>
"The Trial of the week" by Lucien Perrin, featured in the first issue
of the 1892 <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>offers one example of the
"Black Peril."



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Negro, Jo Adeko, had at his side a charming little woman, as blond
and white as he was black. Ah! The rascally Negro! Or, rather, the
rascally white woman! . . . for this Negro had irresistible attributes,
if Ibelieve the scandalous chronicles and the number of his conquests
[which] attest brilliantly to his worth; decidedly, nobody can surpass
Negroes in this domain: such was, at least, the conclusion drawn by the
women present at the trial. . . . Poor Parisian males, what Pygmies we
are next to this Hercules of love. . . . This Negro . . . is of royal
heritage. . . . What decadence, my prince: now he sells chocolates in
front of a grocery shop. . . . The Negro and his mistress were sentenced
to a week's imprisonment.

<p>
But the sexual energy in the Cake-Walk could also be seen as a form of
Devolution: "The lower we descend in the scale of animal life, the more
prominent do the motor reactions become. This life is primarily of the
instinctive type," wrote the American psychologist Boris Sidis in 1908.
<sup><a name="REF93" href="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>
The raw energy and abandon of the body in the Cake-Walk with all
its implications of regression, sexual violence, and the domination
of the "lower orders" is imported into France from an "uncivilized"
place: black America. The spectacle is, at the same time, exotic. "The
operetta 'Floradora' is so exotic that it cannot fail to excite and
retain Parisian curiosity. . . . An extraordinary Cake-Walk sends the
audience into delirium with its simian gestures."
<sup><a name="REF94" href="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
In Raoul Ponchon's poem, "Le Cake-Walk," we learn that the energy
and agitation of the dance comes down to us from our (fore)fathers,
the apes! "This dance of our fathers, the monkeys [is composed of]
agitation and twisting in the attempt to bite oneself. The disorder
has an order to it; it is all done according to a far-distant ritual."
<sup><a name="REF95" href="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>
Ponchon's poem is written in response to a news item, inserted as
epigraph to the poem, that society women are forming an anti-Cake-Walk
league. The magazine <i>Le Rire</i> warns: "While there is still time,
before the Cake-Walk obsession has taken over all classes of society,
let it be known that this Negro dance is all the rage; its vogue
reached its apex with the Bals de l'Op&eacute;ra and l'Op&eacute;ra
comique. . . . It's everywhere: at the Bouffes-Parisiennes: 'Floradora';
le cake-walk; Nouveau Cirque: Joyeux n&egrave;gres, le cake-walk;
Op&eacute;ra: 'Siegfried&#8212;5th act,' le cake-walk. . . . [Attend]
the big protest meeting against [the new negro dance], la Mana Negra."
<sup><a name="REF96" href="#FOOT96">96</a></sup>
A month later, it is clearly too late: the Cake-Walk has taken over in
elegant Parisian salons, as the following poem laments.

<b></b>

<p>
In 22 stanzas of "Pavane et Cake-Walk," Jacques Redelsperger contrasts
"the dances of France" with the Cake-Walk. In the former, the cadence
of French dances carried their partners toward the joyful land of
love, and aristocratic ladies reserved their <i>gestes canailles</i>
(naughty gestures) for the bedroom. "Alas, today French brains are
topsy-turvy and the prancing of monkeys has turned the universe upside
down. Hip! Hip! Hourrah! Let's shake our bodies, chimpanzees and female
monkeys, everyone goes at it with his convulsive jolt. . . . The epileptic
Cake-Walk makes us look like broken toys who spin like madmen. You see
them wherever you go . . . sticking out their stomach, juggling with their
members. . . . Any minute, you expect them to climb up into their coconut
palm trees. . . . Oh little society women, keep the waltz and the Boston,
and let this dance be sweated out by the inmates of Charenton."
<sup><a name="REF97" href="#FOOT97">97</a></sup>

<p>
Dancing the Cake-Walk effects an instantaneous evolutionary
regression, and what is most disturbing is the willingness of the
symbol of elegance&#8212;la Parisienne&#8212;to lead the dance. (<A
NAME="9" href="10.4gordon_res.html#9"> 9</a>) What's
more, it makes the French look like madmen, and it should be left to
the insane who are interned in Charenton hospital. In addition to the
agitated kicking, the arched back must have reminded spectators of the
hysterical <i>arc de cercle</i>. And indeed, among the adjectives that
spring to Redelsperger's pen are "epileptic" and "convulsive." What is
new is the emphatic reference to monkeys. And the Cake-Walk spreads to
all levels of Parisian society like a contagious malady.
<sup><a name="REF98" href="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>
Naturally, the concern is that this dance that blurs class and race
boundaries will eventually <i>destroy</i> those distinctions. Result:
<i>everyone</i> will be savages. In an 1899 drawing by Willette,
"How the French are Seen Abroad," a French couple dressed as African
natives are observed with fear and mistrust by other Europeans. (<A
NAME="0" href="10.4gordon_res.html#0"> 10</a>)
The French are <i>already</i> exotic and sexually provocative
in the eyes of their British, German, and Slavic neighbors! The
situation is more dire in this 1901 Willette drawing: (<a name="1"
href="10.4gordon_res.html#1"> 11</a>) the French couple has
truly regressed to a prehistoric stage of humanity: They have become
savages. And the reason is given in the caption: "Parisians, deprived of
the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, return to the life of savages." It
doesn't take much; just take away the clothing of civilization or the
civilizing effects of high culture, and Parisians will revert to a
prehistoric moment in time. Nonetheless, and this has been pointed out
again and again in commentary on the French reception of Josephine Baker
in 1925, regression is also experienced as a sense of liberation. The
exhilaration of seeing and imitating the black body in movement was
already crucial between 1889 and 1904. And the fantasy of regression
was not foreign to the thrill: nostalgia for a more instinctual life is
apparent in the following poem. "By the folds of the brain . . . science
proves to everyone that Man had the Monkey for a father. Madame, at your
service! I'm going to take off my suit, but, for your part, take off your
underwear. Let's return under the coconut trees, where, all day long,
the drunkenness of gorillas is allowed&#8212;Happiness unknown to man."
<sup><a name="REF99" href="#FOOT99">99</a></sup>
Thus, in a 1904 drawing for <i>Le Rire</i>, the French President
Loubet awards the Legion of Honor to a Cake-Walk-dancing chimpanzee,
"creator of our national dance of France," pronouncing these words:
"Who said that the cake-walk was American in origin?" (<a name="2"

<p>
The fascination for the rhythms of the black body in dance was very much
akin to the fascination for the crazily frenetic rhythms of the Epileptic
Singer. The Epileptic Singer deliberately foregrounded her strangeness,
and the sexual fantasies that surrounded her were further primitivized
by lending her the traits of an African woman,

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 644]</b>

and by linking her to animals and atavism.
<sup><a name="REF100" href="#FOOT100">100</a></sup>
A famous Epileptic Singer, Emilienne d'Alen&ccedil;on, also
performed with a trained donkey act, and, after years of stardom in
the caf&eacute;-concert, ended life as a concierge. The journalist
interviewing her in 1902 remarked that "You often finish like you
began! . . . Atavism is not a meaningless word."
<sup><a name="REF101" href="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>

<p>
These images constructed in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
built upon in the first decade of the twentieth, are essential
to understanding the public for Josephine Baker and <i>La Revue
N&egrave;gre</i> in 1925. I now want to show how the combination of
clownish postures, of hyper-sexuality, and of "bizarre and charming"
black dance movements were co-opted by white stars.
<p>
When Polaire danced the Cake-Walk, Willy wrote that it had "remained a
dance of epileptic savages&#8212;and like a representation of colic and
the illustration of Vomito N&eacute;gro, until the day that Polaire was
kind enough to dance it on the stage of Les Mathurins."
<sup><a name="REF102" href="#FOOT102">102</a></sup>
This assimilation of epilepsy, blackness, savages and disease jumps off
the page like the leaps of an epileptic dancer off the stage. Willy may
have wanted to distinguish Polaire's performance of the Cake-Walk from
what was repulsive to him in the "[nauseating] epileptic savagery"
of the dance, but in fact Polaire was already associated with the
dark continent.
<sup><a name="REF103" href="#FOOT103">103</a></sup>
One might begin with Raoul Ponchon's 1902 poem entitled "Polaire" which
remonstrates against negative characterizations of the singer. "Despite
the enormous caricature of her by Sem and Cappiello, Polaire is an
exquisite woman. . . . Unfortunately, I don't know if, in addition,
she is Callipyge. . . . she has dark and golden skin. . . . I love the
metallic sound of her laughter and her chaotic gestures."
<sup><a name="REF104" href="#FOOT104">104</a></sup>
The Callipyge Venus in the museum of Naples had exaggeratedly developed
buttocks and, indeed, the caricaturist Sem had made her resemble the
Hottentot Venus. Ponchon's poem was the second in a series of four. One
of Polaire's critics, Hugues Delorme, responded in the following issue
of the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>. Not only does he reiterate the
qualification of callipyge, but in the last quatrain, we find our old
friend, the paragon of ugliness, Mademoiselle Abdala. "You, Ponchon,
adore Polaire?! . . . What a cynical lie! The only heart that your
heart tolerates, is it not that of Abdala? . . . "
<sup><a name="REF105" href="#FOOT105">105</a></sup>
(As we will soon see, Polaire and Abdala not only shared the
black, voracious mouth, but like Abdala, she was viewed as a
Phenomenon.) Polaire herself wrote a response to Ponchon in the
following issue acknowledging his compliments and elaborating on her
female critics as "envious creatures": whatever their name, "they are
always la m&ocirc;me caca!. . . . [and] it is thanks to their grumbling
that I realized how charming my [physique] was."
<sup><a name="REF106" href="#FOOT106">106</a></sup>

<p>
Born in Algeria of an Algerian-born Frenchman, she had "dark skin,
a physique one wasn't accustomed to meet in Paris."
<sup><a name="REF107" href="#FOOT107">107</a></sup>
In her memoirs, <i>Polaire par elle-m&ecirc;me</i>, Polaire writes
"My <i>instincthad me make crazily excited gestures</i>. . . . I sang
. . . with my <i>nostrils flaring</i>, with my <i>fists clenched</i>, and
even with my toes twitching in my shoes. . . . I let my <i>wild mane</i>
go free. . . . I sang bent over backward . . . with <i>nervous</i>,
exasperated movements" (<i>PPEM</i>, 83; emphasis mine). Every part
of Polaire's body, from the contractions of her hands to the tensed-up
members, twitching feet and the <i>arc de cercle ,</i> conforms to the
picture of nineteenth-century hysteria. At the same time, much of the
italicized vocabulary also evokes the savage with equal insistance. The
media seized

<b></b>

upon the image of Polaire as the incarnation of sexual vice, and that
contributed to her meteoric rise to stardom.
<sup><a name="REF108" href="#FOOT108">108</a></sup>
Yet Polaire's image did not only draw on the comparison of the Epileptic
Singer with the prostitute. It reached farther down into the French
psyche. L&eacute;on Nemo and Jules Gondoin wrote that "her capricious
and pretty face of a delicate and perverse little animal is profiled
on the most modern of Parisian horizons."
<sup><a name="REF109" href="#FOOT109">109</a></sup>
Her friend Colette noted that when Polaire was sad, she "leaned her
cheek on her shoulder like those ravishing little monkeys [sold by]
dealers in exotic animals."
<sup><a name="REF110" href="#FOOT110">110</a></sup>
Again we see the attraction of epilepsy and animality. What I want
to try to untangle in these descriptions of gesture in Polaire's
performances is the question of instinct and influence. The source
named by Polaire in her own account of them is "my instinct." From
<i>her</i> instinctual drives came the "nervous movements" and the
"crazily excited gestures." But is this the same instinct that is
called to mind for the readers of <i>Le Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>
in 1894? In her performance at the Ambassadeurs in 1894, she is "a
whirlwind . . . nervous to an excess, her amorous hips with their
crazy twisting, and her legs . . . each is a torpedo sending the
foot flying. With her strident voice, she excels in the fashionable,
nervous, neurotic morbidity. . . . All of this <i>instinctive noise</i>,
<i>incessant stamping</i> and trembling. . . . This, henceforth, is
the <i>genre Polaire</i>."
<sup><a name="REF111" href="#FOOT111">111</a></sup>
One can safely assume that, when nearly three million spectators watched
dancers from Dahomey in that year alone, the words "instinctive" and
"incessant stamping"&#8212;an image underlined by the references to North
Africa in the same article&#8212;brought forth images of African dancers,
while the constellation of "instinctive noise, trembling, nervous
and neurotic" also brought forth the image of hysterics. Nonetheless,
Polaire was (it seems to me) <i>imitating</i>neither African dancers
nor hysterics. On the contrary, she tries to make a case in her memoirs
for the origination of these gestures in her own nervous system. In
the interviews that I cite below, we will see that she also accounts
for a personal, childhood source for the dance movements that resemble
those of Africans. Only 18 years old in 1894, Polaire from that time on
takes credit for "inventing" the genre &eacute;pileptique. In the article
cited above, Jean d'Arc writes that she is "a wildcat whose eyes glimmer
in the Algerian nights with bizarre and wild reflections: she was born
in Algiers&#8212;on the border of dull civilizations [and] the deserts
of liberty." In addition, she has "the breasts of an Alm&eacute;e,"
that is to say, a belly-dancer ("MPAA," 9). Polaire may be "<i>the
most Parisienne</i> among Parisians," but she is nevertheless more the
"daughter of Africa with her languorous eyes brilliant with sunshine,
and the slow lascivious walk of women from down there."
<sup><a name="REF112" href="#FOOT112">112</a></sup>
The oscillation between "<i>the most Parisienne</i>" and the
"daughter of Africa" could not be more important; it is precisely
this undecidability that made Polaire the biggest music-hall star
of her generation. And, along with her "neurotic" traits, it is also
key to her title to modernity, as the earlier reference to the "most
modern of Parisian horizons" attests. In an interview for the magazine
<i>ComoediaIllustrated</i>, Polaire confessed: "I knew I was more strange
than pretty, I felt myself more capable of emotion and passion than of
comedy, what was I doing&#8212;despite the success and money&#8212;on
a music-hall stage?"
<sup><a name="REF113" href="#FOOT113">113</a></sup>
And in a <i>Fantasio</i> interview, after describing her childhood in
Algeria, she claims that she learned the belly dance from Ouled-Nail
nomads while still a child and danced it to enthusiastic

<b></b>

"little Negroes" in the neighborhood. Criticized for her lack of decorum
and unconventional behavior, she explains: "I am a <i>sauvagesse</i>." She
then asks a leading question, but one that we should have no trouble
answering: "the little Savage has not only become a Parisienne, but one
of the most representative silhouettes of Paris, this Paris where all
fashion of paradox becomes reality. How did that happen?"
<sup><a name="REF114" href="#FOOT114">114</a></sup>
The answer will become so obvious that in 1925, no one will have
to ask the question. Her dark skin and her excessively narrow waist
(which accentuated her hips) were the reason that "people insisted on
only seeing me as a Phenomenon (<i>une ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne</i>)"
(<i>PPEM</i>, 10-1). In the context of the music-hall, as I have
noted, the term Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne has a very precise meaning,
akin to "freak." What made Polaire a phenomenon was also her physique,
but&#8212;as we see from her own description&#8212;not only the famous
wasp-waist. She mentions her wild mane twice in her memoirs. She cropped
her hair short&#8212;just above the shoulder&#8212;in 1900: twenty
years before other "liberated" women all rushed out to "bob" their hair
in order to conform to fashion. This and her narrow waist explain her
being billed in America as "The Ugliest Woman in the World," a billing
that confirms the above equation between Phenomenon and freak. (<A
NAME="3" href="10.4gordon_res.html#3"> 13</a>) For
there was a precedent in America for the billing: it was Julia Pastrana,
a bearded Mexican-Indian woman with simian features and "yellow-brown
skin" who sang and danced between 1854 and 1860; Pastrana was also
sometimes billed as a freak, "The Apewoman." Her "hideous" face, as an
1888 commentator described it, was in stark contrast to the grace she
exhibited in dancing Pepitas and flings in short dresses very much like
those worn by singers in France.
<sup><a name="REF115" href="#FOOT115">115</a></sup>
Polaire's involvement in the fascination that Blackness held for
Parisians was not unidirectional: Polaire <i>bought</i> and brought
back a young black man from her American tour, as we learn to our shock
in an article in the magazine <i>Femina</i>. The illustration shows
the smiling sixteen-year-old Jimmy alongside the medallion inscribed
"I belong to Melle Polaire. Please return me to her" that he supposedly
wears around his neck.
<sup><a name="REF116" href="#FOOT116">116</a></sup>

<p>
If, as I suggested earlier, Polaire was intent on underlining the
origins in her own body and in her own childhood for nervous, epileptic
movements, as well as for African dance movements, she nonetheless would
not have been able to stake a personal claim for the black American
Cake-Walk. In the mind of the average French spectator though, there
was a considerable amount of conflation between Africans and black
Americans. Did Polaire's Cake-Walk express her own identity, or did it
mime the fantasized identification of her public? A review of a musical at
the Moulin-Rouge, "The Belle of New York," notes the irresistible desire
on the part of spectators: "You will split your sides laughing. The
night of the premiere, the spectators were so delighted by the play,
so worked up and carried along by the extraordinary movement which is
the characteristic of this genre of spectacle that some of them left
dancing the jig <i>involuntarily</i>, while others were carried away
and executed steps of the cakewalk."
<sup><a name="REF117" href="#FOOT117">117</a></sup>
The reviewer also remarks that the "perpetual jigs make one
think that all of the characters are afflicted with the St. Vitus
Dance." The space of performance is an exchange between performer and
audience&#8212;particularly in the caf&eacute;-concerts and music-halls
where audience participation was firmly implanted from the beginning in

<b></b>

these sites. Moreover, the intensity and specificity of this exchange in
late nineteenth-century Paris was colored by the dynamics of unconscious
imitation that I have discussed elsewhere. When racial identifications are
inserted into this exchange, the dynamics are complicated further. To cite
W. T. Lhamon, "when a gesture comes to stand for someone other than its
apparent originator, what is the meaning? How does it happen? . . . Maybe
marketing of gestures exhibited this complexity of cultural property:
that it was saleable but never exclusive property. You could buy it and
you could

<b></b>

sell it, but you could not own it. Maybe the step took over the stepper,
an inversion analogous to the tail wagging the dog." Lhamon is writing
about black slaves and freemen in New York's Catharine market who were
"dancing out their identity, and. . . . increasingly . . . the identities
of their publics, who paid them for their gestures."
<sup><a name="REF118" href="#FOOT118">118</a></sup>
He is attempting to trace the evolution of gesture from these street
performances of the 1820s to the mid-century blackface minstrel shows,
and he is using the wheeling gesture as a gestural touchstone. I find
his remarks very pertinent to performances of the Cake-Walk at the
turn-of-the-century, whose gestural touchstones are the arched back and
the high kicking strut. What has been exchanged between Polaire and her
public? The fascination that the energy of black bodies in movement
holds for the French has been incorporated into Polaire's person,
thanks to her physique, her movements, and to the media.
<sup><a name="REF119" href="#FOOT119">119</a></sup>
The attraction that the image of blackness holds, as it is seen and
fantasized, is now packaged in a product with white skin that can be
openly enjoyed by the masses.
<sup><a name="REF120" href="#FOOT120">120</a></sup>
Polaire has managed the aesthetic creation of a type removed from the
real thing. Thus, Willy was able to write that until she danced the
Cake-Walk, it had "remained a dance of epileptic savagery and Vomito
Negro." Still, the residual feelings of fear and repulsion are present
and Polaire was the first to feel their sting. Polaire's short hair was
a striking and brazen example of her Amazon-like nature; she wrote that
people found her short hair disgusting, and petulant, she insistently
repeated that her "wild mane" <i>was not</i> in fact naturally
curly. When she appeared at Les Ambassadeurs in the early 1890s,
already a star, she became fodder for humorists and caricaturists. "Sem,
whom all his colleagues soon imitated, represented me with a ring in
my nose and the black curls of a <i>N&eacute;gresse</i>. Always the
same error about my hair: it was neither black nor curly. . . . Sem
ornamented my body with enough rotundities to put the Hottentot Venus
to shame!" (<i>PPEM</i>, 93).
<sup><a name="REF121" href="#FOOT121">121</a></sup>
(<a name="4" href="10.4gordon_res.html#4"> 14</a>)
Photographs of Polaire show her to have dark, wavy hair, but the
caricaturist's transformation is easily understood: he is simply
completing a picture of sexuality and Phenomenon that includes
Blackness. Polaire may not have known why people always made the mistake,
but we do: epileptic contortions and fever-pitched sexuality immediately
brought associations with blackness. In the text that accompanies this
image, Sem accuses contemporary couturiers of pathologizing fashion:
"the processions of disarticulated manikins (resemble) a music-hall
extravaganza" producing "scenes of modern hysteria" and "moral
perversion" where the only thing missing is "the <i>N&eacute;gresse</i>."
<sup><a name="REF122" href="#FOOT122">122</a></sup>
However, she is not missing for long: women dressed in these fashions
look like "female savages decorated with talismans. . . . Papous from New
Caledonia with dyed manes, (and) troglodytes." Yet "the supreme horror"
is a real, not an imagined savage, a cannibal: "a cannibal with frizzy
hair . . . her body strangulated, almost cut in half . . . a ring in
her nose, the mouth dripping with blood and split open from ear to
ear. . . . "
<sup><a name="REF123" href="#FOOT123">123</a></sup>
The cannibal is none other than Polaire. This weave of images&#8212;the
music-hall, dance as hysteria, pathology as fashion, vice, the savage
<i>N&eacute;gresse</i>, evolutionary regression past (Troglodytes) and
present (Africa, New Caledonia)&#8212;is the one I have been elaborating
upon in this study. What we must note, though, is its tenacity, for Sem
is writing in 1914. By then, this cluster of associations has become a
clich&eacute;, a clich&eacute;, moreover, that Josephine Baker's 1925
debut will

<b></b>

exploit to its fullest. Polaire's extraordinary appeal as the incarnation
of Vice must also include the "<i>N&eacute;gresse's</i> sexual savagery,"
and I venture to say that she knew that very well. Now that we have
seen the image of the Hottentot Venus spring to Polaire's mind, we
can be certain that the term "Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne" did not occur
innocently in her memoirs. For in fact, the first female Phenomenon to be
exhibited in Paris in the nineteenth century was none other than Sartjie
Baartman. It was not for nothing that Polaire and another dark-haired
Epileptic Singer, Eug&eacute;nie Foug&egrave;re, a Spanish Jew, were the
first white stars to dance the Cake-Walk in Paris. Foug&egrave;re was
described as "na&iuml;ve et sauvage," and when she returned to the stage
in 1920 after a long hiatus (in a musical revue with none other than
Polaire), she appeared "in the costume of an American Negro." At least
in this original fantasy, she told an interviewer, "I felt my old self

<b></b>

again." The incorporation of blackness by this white singer suggests that
the motivations for adopting a black persona and the effects of such a
mascarade might have gone beyond the purposes of simple exploitation.
<sup><a name="REF124" href="#FOOT124">124</a></sup>
Essentially making the Cake-Walk a variant of her own style, the bawdy
female caf&eacute;-concert performer encouraged the oblique aura of
racial attributes that already hovered around her to become a more
explicit part of her persona.
<p>
Contained in this aura was an extraordinary sense of liberation from the
layers of inhibition imposed by societal conventions and taboos against
bodily abandon; freedom, too, from rejections of images of illness,
deformity, and ugliness. This "return of the repressed"&#8212;marked
as inherent to "primitive" peoples and, at the same time, as symptom
of epilepsy and hysteria&#8212;was facilitated by the form of popular
spectacle invented by the "animalistically aggressive" singers I have
described here. Discussing the mirror held up by the media, Mary Russo
has written that grotesque representations of women, the disabled, and
sexual and racial minorities offer one the chance to "parade in these fun
house mirrors [and to] surrender one's identity as no longer possibly
correct, recognizable, . . . but inevitably bound to other bodies and
strange selves."
<sup><a name="REF125" href="#FOOT125">125</a></sup>
This dynamic is akin to Freud's Uncanny and is precisely the one at
work in the Parisian spectators' experience of the Epileptic Singer, the
minstrel, and the African dancer. Freud writes, "we see in epilepsy and
madness the workings of forces hitherto unexpected" and dimly perceived
"in a remote category of [one's] own being."
<sup><a name="REF126" href="#FOOT126">126</a></sup>
This is clearly a dynamic that thrilled spectators in the electrified,
nervous ambience of the Music Hall.
<sup><a name="REF127" href="#FOOT127">127</a></sup>
For the more sophisticated members of the public, this liberation
was not only that of the body, but that of the mind and senses: those
spectators sensed that they were experiencing a new art form.
<p>
Picasso's 1907 "Demoiselles d'Avignon" explicitly joined African masks to
prostitution (and syphilis) and moved these fantasies about the primitive
onto the stage of High Art at the same time that the musical purveyors
of the primitive were leaving the stages of popular entertainment. Two
decades later, black primitivism would be incarnated by Josephine Baker,
and the aggressive, animalistic dislocations of the Epileptic Singers'
bodies would be definitively forgotten.

The Mus&eacute;e de l'Arm&eacute;e also inaugurated an ethnographic

H. T. Sampson dates the first black minstrels in London in February
1870; they were followed by Hick's Original Georgia Minstrels in July
1870. The earliest examples of minstrelsy in Paris that I have been able
to date are: the Mannon Sontargs who presented musical numbers, burlesque
sketches, dances and acrobatics, ending with a comic monologue by one of
the endmen, "considered to be a marvel of grotesque humor" (1875-1880;
in Alan Weill, <i>Exposition Chaumont 1993: Jazz, pop, rock</i> [Paris:
Somogy, 1993], 29). In 1877 at the Alcazar d'Hiver, Armand Ben introduced
the character of the black Dandy, a parody of white nouveaux riches. The
following year, Jilson and Reed, billed as Burlesque Negroes&#8212;a
name that will stick to the end of the century, performed at the same
venue. By the 1880s, a new caf&eacute;-concert genre had emerged called
"Les Exotiques," American and Englishmen in blackface.

The director of the zoological Gardens was the celebrated evolutionist,
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The spectacle of fourteen Nubians going about the
activities of daily life in the Paris Jardin d'acclimatation was a huge
commercial success. Around thirty such exhibits followed up until 1912,
and enjoyed the same success. These are the years of French colonial
expansion (1870-1910) during the Third Republic. The 1881 Terra del
Fuego exhibit in Paris drew over 50,000 visitors on a single Sunday
(the natives of Terra del Fuego had the distinction of being designated
by Darwin as the lowest form of the human race). Only the very briefest
sketch of these exhibits is given here; the reader is referred to the
work of Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard, Laurent Gervereau, <i>Images
et colonies</i> (Paris: Achac/BDICE, 1993) and Nicolas Bancel &amp;

One amusing proof of anthropological knowledge filtering down to the Music
Hall is Willette's 1899 cover of the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>: a

A reading of Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll

between degeneration theory and evolution in 1886. Hyde is "like
a madman," "ape-like" and "troglodytic," "deformed somewhere," and
"stump[s] along" with a pathological gait (1886; New York: Bantam Books,
1981), 4, 8, 18, 27.

(France). Pithecanthropus erectus was discovered in Java, and was

Henri de Weindel, "Black Charm" <i>Fantasio</i> (1 September 1906),
100. The allure continues to hold fast in reviews of Josephine Baker's
performances. Nancy Cunard described the "cannibal beauty." Parallels
with Epileptic Singers are rife: "the little savage of the early days
with her delirious, grotesque dances" (Cunard, <i>Negro</i> [1934; New
York: Negro Universities Press, 1969], 329). In those early days, Pierre
de R&eacute;gnier asked: "Is it a man? . . . Is it a woman? . . . the
voice is high-pitched, she is in a perpetual tremble. . . . this dance of
rare indecency is the triumph of lubricity" (cited in Sieglinde Lemke,
<i>Primitivist Modernism</i> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998],
99). These examples are far from being the only ones that demonstrate an
extraordinary similarity between perceptions of the Epileptic Singers and
perceptions of Josephine Baker (whose dancing was labeled epileptic by
two journalists reviewing the premiere of <i>La Revue n&egrave;gre</i>),
explored in greater detail in my book in progress, <i>Backstage at the

The Cake-Walk originated on ante-bellum Southern plantations as a
parody of the Master's dances by the slaves who danced it. The original
parodic nature of the dance was unknown to French audiences and to
white performers. It is thus ironic that the Cake-Walk has been seen
as a display of black, regressive traits, and doubly ironic that the
white imitation of a black dance imitating upper-class white dancers
should be labeled dangerous in regard to unconscious imitation and
contagion. Moreover, the specific <i>type</i> of Cake-Walk that was
imported into France was not the more graceful walk around, but the
type known in America as the comic or eccentric Cake-Walk (documents
of both examples can be found in the film archives at the Library of
Congress). The Cake-Walk was first presented in a white musical production
in the United States in 1883, and by 1898, according to Tom Fletcher,
"all of the big colored shows and black minstrel companies featured it"
(cited in Jean and Marshall Sterns, <i>Jazz Dance: The Story of American
Vernacular Dance</i> [New York: Da Capo Press, 1994]).

The Elks were white Cake-Walk dancers, while the other couples were
black. Like Cocteau, the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> reviewer focused
on the Elks. "Of the couples who stood out the most, the Elks were
peerless; their science of choreography, the diversity of the poses and
the elegance of the postures caused a sensation" ("Au Nouveau-Cirque,"
<i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> [2 November 1902], 10).

The wild Bal des Quat'z Arts thrown annually by the students of the
&Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts ended in spectacular fashion in 1903: on 25
April, five hundred drunken and dancing revelers descended from the Butte
Montmartre back to the school on the rue Bonaparte. There "they burned a
black-tinted mannequin who had first been pierced through several times
with a lance. This Negro was none other than Mr. Cake-Walk, to whom the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts has just given the coup de gr&acirc;ce" (Paul Delay
in the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> [3 May 1903], 4). In fact, several
new dances were introduced in 1903 in an attempt to replace the Cake-Walk.
<p>
The Nouveau-Cirque, who had launched the black dance phenomenon in Paris
now tried to top the colossal success of the Cake-Walk, opening its
1904 season with "Modern-Sports," a nautical pantomime with new American
dances. "The two new dances are to the Cake-Walk what poetry is to prose,
the Boston-Ball and the Trans-Atlantique (which) possess as much fantasy,
but have much more charm, elegance, and correct manners. . . . exquisite
amusements and which are in good taste" (<i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>
[3 January 1904], 8). These dances did not achieve the success of the
Cake-Walk. Thus, in 1905, the Nouveau-Cirque brought back the <i>Joyeux
N&egrave;gres</i> revue, calling it "The Joyous Negroes with the Real
Cake-Walk," just to remind the public that everything began here, and
other venues had only copies, not the true article. Over 400 performances
of the <i>Joyeux N&egrave;gres</i> had failed to dampen their enormous
success. The 1905 show contained several new attractions, including
Foottit and Chocolat hilariously performing the dance. But notice
how the criticism has softened into unmitigated praise: "The public
again enjoyed watching this show whose charm is so picturesque and so
thrilling: surprised and amused once again, they took pleasure in the
primitive and engaging poetry of this choreography, sometimes strange,
but with a vivacity, a fantasy, and a gaiety without equal. . . . [It is]
an amusement that is unique in all the world. The enthusiastic public
applauded, and frenetically cried Bravo! and Encore!" (<i>Courrier
Fran&ccedil;ais</i> [16 March 1905], 4).

45 colored lithographs, <i>Le Tumulte noir</i> (Paris: Succ&egrave;s

The intense fascination in France for the black Other may well carry a
specificity in addition to that of colonialism. The emotions aroused
by the performances I have discussed must have included a tension
between the ideal of republican Universalism in the third republic and
this Other which seemed impossible to assimilate. This is an aspect I
have not undertaken to explore here, but which certainly merits more
reflection. I would like to thank the members of the history symposium
at the University of Georgia, Athens, the colloquium of the Department
of Modern and Classical Languages at the University of Connecticut,
and Rutgers University faculty members for their valuable comments
when versions of this paper were read. Thanks also to Tammy Berberi, my
research assistant in May 2001 at the Biblioth&egrave;que de l'Arsenal
for her excellent work, and finally to the University of Connecticut
Research Foundation for the grant I received for this research.

<p>
Gertrude Stein's texts have attracted a considerable number of book
illustrators. Before she acquired fame as a writer, Daniel-Henry
Kahnweiler, a German Jewish expatriate whose gallery promoted young
artists such as Picasso, Braque, L&eacute;ger, Gris, and Masson, published
two of her texts perhaps in homage to an informed collector. Much
later in her career, her children's book, <i>The World is Round</i>,
will require mimetic imagery suitable for young readers.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
When, long after her death, she had become an avant-garde icon,
experimental artists saw in her a kindred spirit. In this respect, she
rivals other modernists such as Joyce, Apollinaire, Mallarm&eacute;,
Rimbaud, Eluard, and Ponge whose challenging texts have attracted
avant-garde illustrators. The presence of Gertrude Stein in this
predominantly French group need not surprise us granted the number of
translations of her texts available to French readers.
<p>
Thanks to the publication of <i>A Book Concluding as a Wife has a Cow</i>
 and <i>The Village</i> , Gertrude Stein found herself in
good company, for the perceptive Kahnweiler had chosen as collaborators
for his painters soon to become famous writers such as Apollinaire,
Artaud, Jacob, Leiris, Malraux, and Reverdy.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Juan Gris, a close friend of Gertrude Stein, who had acquired several
of his paintings, contributed a cubistic accompaniment to her subtly
erotic text. Rather than reacting to the text, he provided a kind of
monument in honor of an art patron.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<b></b>

The neglected Elie Lascaux transformed <i>The Village</i>  into
a stele.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
In his lithographs, he never forgets to treat <i>The Village</i> as a
play. In the first plate, he makes the village with its church steeple,
houses, and streets, fully visible as an architectural stage set enhanced
by decorative representations of the sun, clouds, and birds suspended
from above. In subsequent plates, the village functions simultaneously
as a backdrop, a curtain, and a frame for Stein's brief drama. Lascaux'
contribution consists in theatrically enshrining Stein's text in a
manner reminiscent of medieval illumination. The fact that he provided
a suitable village setting for the play suggests that he responded to
the title rather than to the hermetic English text.
<p>
Gertrude Stein's publications would have remained without further
adornment&#8212;apart from documentary photographs in her two
autobiographies and wartime texts&#8212;had she not composed two books for
children: <i>The World is Round</i>,  and <i>The First Reader</i>,
published posthumously in 1946.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Skillfully alternating between a decorative and a theatrical style,
Sir Francis Rose's drawings for <i>The World is Round</i>, published
in London the same year as the American edition, hardly depart from
humorous vignettes and <i>culs-de-lampe</i>. No less than Lascaux,
he has provided ornamental settings. A similar approach marks
his accompaniment to <i>The First Reader</i>. (<a name="1"
href="10.4hubert_res.html#1"> 1</a>)
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Thanks to the persuasiveness of William R. Scott, her New York
publisher, Stein actively collaborated with Clement Hurd, a pupil of
Fernand L&eacute;ger who specialized in the illustration of children's
books. Not surprisingly, Hurd provided the only closely programmed
not to say mimetic rendition of a Stein text. While insisting on the
visual consistency required in children's books, he showed originality
in combining striking imagery with imaginative page settings.
<p>
<i>The World is Round</i> displays many of the usual features of Stein's
style.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The title may strike grownups as no more than a truism but for young
readers, to whom the world's sphericity appears far from obvious, it
promises an initiation. As the narrative unfolds, Rose, an insecure
nine year old, plays an increasingly heroic part while her self-assured
cousin, Willie, remains steadfast throughout. As in most of Stein's
fictions, the key role invariably belongs to a female. The author's
well-known avoidance of stasis and containment results in a multiplicity
of outer-directed anecdotes. In rapid succession, she tells condensed
stories featuring chain enumerations. She thereby expresses acceleration
in time and extension in space while reminding the reader that the
world remains stubbornly round and suggesting that it whirls as in a
round dance. Although Stein repeatedly insists on the earth's rotundity,
she downgrades this universal truth to a fairy tale belief: "Once upon
a time the world was round and you could go on it around and around"
(<i>TWIR</i>, 1). Dominant at first, circularity eventually shares the
limelight with other directions. When Rose succeeds in arduously climbing
a mountain, her upward mobility somehow neutralizes the roundness that
obsesses her.
<p>
Shapes and directions prevail throughout, and color plays a highly
significant role. Stated in Stein's signature sentence at the very
beginning of the tale: "A rose is a rose is a rose" (<i>TWIR</i>,
1), the word designates a flower, a color, and a child. Misgivings
and reassurances concerning her colorful name and her identity recur
throughout. Rose repeatedly shows a preference for blue. She has blue
eyes and drags a blue garden chair to the summit of a blue mountain. We
can construe her eagerness to reach the

<b></b>

very top both as an idealistic aspiration as well as a compulsion. She
reacts intensely and repeatedly to all occurrences. She thinks, she talks,
she sings, she cries. Elation and worry succeed one another. Stein has
made Rose's songs, invariably followed by lamentations, an essential
part of the text. Indeed, they provide lyrical interludes while

<b></b>

stressing the importance of sound. Music joins forces with noises, for
instance the noise of her poodle lapping water. Sound patterns based on
rhyme and alliteration recur as frequently in <i>The World is Round</i>
as in other of Stein's poetic texts: "Dear me hair chair ran man"
(<i>TWIR</i>, 31), "blue just blue" (<i>TWIR</i>, 32), " . . . so it
was a very long way to go even if a mountain does not grow even so,
climb a mountain and you will know even if there is no snow. Oh no"
(<i>TWIR</i>, 37). The O's shape conjoins with sound. Indeed, this
visible phoneme echoes the earth's rotundity.
<p>
We may wonder to what extent Clement Hurd's illustrations conform to
Stein's disturbing and subverting writing. And how could he possibly
represent reiterated distinctions between body and mind hardly appropriate
in a children's book? The sound effects and phonetic play, so intimately
linked with other verbal aspects, show considerable independence in
regard to syntax, logic, and structure. She favors a language full
of vitality and apt to astonish her readers. The pink paper and blue
print chosen by Gertrude Stein herself pleasurably disturb our reading
habits while reinforcing the heroine's presence and even adding to her
substance. Hurd's designs, scenes, and landscapes strike us as flat and
streamlined, in keeping with imagery suitable to young readers as well
as with Stein's persistent present. He conveys rotundity by a round dance
where several animals, all of them featured in the text, step forward or
backward to participate in a moving circle. Although he represents the
animals according to different scales, he carefully preserves their chief
characteristics: the endless neck of the giraffe, the sturdy shape of the
elephant. The vitality of the imagery and its affinity with Stein arise
from a multiplicity of curly lines: spiral fragments counter balancing
simple linear contours. Accompanied by her white poodle, Rose in a white
dress holds a rose in her hand. This first illustration encompasses to
a large degree both the metaphoric and the anecdotal sides of the story
while foretelling many of the playful gestures characteristic of Stein.
<p>
Round shapes and signs appear more intermittently than in the text,
modified as spiral and elliptic objects, each one assigned a specific
role. On two occasions toward the end of the book, a round shaped map-like
re, echoing the text, makes an appearance. The blue chair Rose
takes with her in her ascent appears as far more than a mere object in
Hurd's interpretation. In its repeated recurrences in the illustrations,
this object becomes a personified spiral stage prop fully involved in
Rose's adventures.
<p>
Rose and Willie always appear separately in the graphics. We see Rose
in the opening illustration surrounded by wild animals and in close
proximity to a lion shaped, if not colored, like her poodle. We first
see Willie in a meditative posture, his back turned to an enlarged
lion's head undoubtedly groomed in the same parlor as Rose's dog. In
Hurd's representations, trees play a more important part than in the
text. They punctuate Rose's trajectory to the summit, and the most
rotund among them proudly carries the circular inscription of Rose's
name. (<a name="2" href="10.4hubert_res.html#2"> 2</a>)
Not only do these trees measure the little girl's ascent, but seem to
protect her from encroaching night before their replacement by a dark
irregularly shaped cloud abundantly sprinkled with stars.
<p>
We can hardly overlook the humor that Hurd derives from Stein's text. In
the opening illustration, his comic display of animals performing in
seeming unison even though they do not turn their heads and tails the
same way relates to Stein's personifications

<b></b>

by bridging all categories and barriers. (<a name="3"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#3"> 3</a>) When Hurd on the back
cover shows the hindquarters of the two lions, moving away from their
owner and the reader, they remain recognizable by the vibrations of their
curly hair. By behaving like circus performers or toys, his animals will
never threaten the most timorous child.
<p>
In collaboration with Clement Hurd, Arion Press published in 1986 a
limited edition of <i>The World is Round</i>. Instead of reproducing
the 1939 drawings, they transformed the Linotypes and woodcuts Hurd had
produced for the 1967 edition into

<b></b>

photo-engravings.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Andrew Hoyem's departure from earlier editions consists in
producing a perfectly circular volume housed in a metal box
and accompanied by an inflatable pink balloon. (<a name="4"
href="10.4hubert_res.html#4"> 4</a>) Thus, bookwork matters
most of all, for a circular volume demands considerable expertise in the
placing of both the text and the illustrations. Not only does circularity
suit to perfection Stein's title and themes, but it wheels the book
away from convention and speeds it toward adventure. When opened, the
book presents a succession of facing round pages containing either a
text or an illustration&#8212;

<b></b>

one per chapter. Deprived of images and margins, the text requires a
much tighter printing texture than in the 1939 and 1967 editions. At
the beginning, circular and spiral shapes occur quite frequently:
the circular or elliptic dance of the animals, the irregularly shaped
cloud, the lion attaining a global rotundity by moving from a profiled
to a frontal view. In keeping with the circular pages, the revised
graphics put all the emphasis on the prevalence of roundness in Stein's
text. Compared to Hurd's 1939 illustrations, those of the Arion Press
show a greater attempt at stylization. Clouds, stars, and sun, present
in the first edition, give way to less representational forms. The fur
or hair of the animals in the 1986 edition would hardly arouse tactile
desire. Featureless blue faces undermine Rose's and Willie's identity. And
as Hoyem reduces the color scheme to blue, white, and black, rose, the
featured color in the pink-papered original edition, appears only in the
accompanying inflatable balloon and the binding. By thus eliminating
details and colors and placing the emphasis on circularity, Hoyem has
somehow succeeded in increasing the reader's awareness of the upward
movement prevailing in the text. In carrying ever upwards the spiral
shaped chair, the heroine becomes more and more lively and purposeful. As
a result, she shows greater ability to move in the landscape. Striking
us as increasingly dramatic, concentrated, and powerful, the scenery
reaches its climax when Rose confronts the waterfall. The vegetation
has ceased to function as a mere accompaniment. Whereas in the original
version the leaves of grass and branches sprout gently from the ground,
in the circular volume they vigorously form labyrinthine clusters. And
as the branches embrace each other they get ready to form an aggressive
circle surrounding the little girl. Moreover, the dynamic and impinging
waterfall and, later, the intense light beam assailing the climber
transform the landscape into a menacing presence. (This refers back to

<p>
Hoyem's transformation of Hurd's illustrated edition into an artist book
provides a middle ground between mimetic and performative illustration. A
number of artists, most of them with French connections, but with little
else in common than their deep involvement in visual interpretations of
literary masterpieces, have provided new settings for, and found new
meanings in, Gertrude Stein's often hermetic texts. Martine Saillard
whose Edition Traversi&egrave;re specializes in avant-garde texts,
persuaded a team of five international postmodern artists, all of whom
assemble and disassemble Stein's words in various ways, to react to
<i>Une Pi&egrave;ce circulaire</i> .
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
They are Jiri Kolar (Czech), Tom Phillips (British), Albert Ayme
(French), Arthur Aeschbacher (Swiss), and Brion Gysin (American).
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Aur&eacute;lie de Nemours, a French hard-edge abstractionist,
Mathew Tyson, a British minimalist residing in France, Irma Blank,
an Italian whose rhythmic writing deconstructs conventional meaning,
Shirley Sharoff, an American etcher and bookworker residing in Paris,
Barbara Fahrner, a German who has illustrated Schwitters, Celan, and
Cage for Granary Books, and the American Susan Weil, an illustrator
of <i>Finnegan's Wake,</i> who studied painting at the &Eacute;cole
Julian in Paris before joining the Black Mountain group, have achieved
remarkable results in accompanying texts by Gertrude Stein.

<b></b>

<p>
Initiated by Edouard Manet in 1874, the Parisian "livre de peintre" has
recently become an American institution. Granary Books, Kaldewey, Vincent
Fitzgerald in New York, Arion, Brighton, Lapis in California have, among
others, produced many innovative limited editions featuring graphics by
major artists. Moreover, these publishers have insisted on letterpress,
fast becoming an endangered craft in France. The Fitzgerald/Susan Weil's
edition of Gertrude Stein's <i>Tender Buttons</i>, no less than other
productions of this press, provides interpretive displays worthy of the
literary masterpieces they accompany.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The binding with its strategic insertions of seven etched vignettes,
the elegant and eminently readable letterpress, the plates framed in
perfect squares divided into nine equally square etchings, and the
various vignettes skillfully collaged on the printed pages convey a
sense of order contrasting with the apparent randomness of <i>Tender
Buttons</i>. We can assume that Weil and Fitzgerald have sought to
reveal the hidden tightness of Stein's organization.
<p>
In some respects, we can regard Weil's graphics for <i>Tender Buttons</i>
as programmed insofar as she has provided readily recognizable, if
fragmented, representations of objects featured in the text. But in
all other respects, her graphics in this carefully produced American
"livre de peintre" clearly emphasizes performance notably by means
of visual quotations. By including details from Picasso's famous
portrait she alludes to cubist influences in the poetry. Moreover,
she dwells repeatedly on Stein's eyes and hands as though to insist
on observation and manipulation not only on the part of the author of
<i>Tender Buttons</i> but of her own critical activity in reacting to
the poems. In any case, Weil goes beyond the target text in order to
take into account such biographical

<b></b>

considerations as Stein's rapport with Picasso and her patronage of
art. Nor do the etchings neglect other aspects of Stein's existence,
notably her relationship with Alice B. Toklas covertly evoked in <i>Tender
Buttons</i>, perhaps even in its potentially erotic title.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Indeed, the sensual coloration of the binding, the set of flesh colored
etchings appearing early in the book, the brightly colored plates
corresponding to the section on <i>Food</i>, and the photogravures of
<i>Rooms</i> evoke the more intimate aspects of the poems. And in the
very first plate of <i>Rooms</i>, we can identify the two faceless
women as Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.
<p>
Stein's division of the book into three separate but nonetheless
interrelated sections may have led to Weil's division of the plates
into nine perfect squares, a procedure that has allowed her to frame
programmatic elements within modernist grids. Walker has clearly
explained the division of <i>Tender Buttons</i> into three parts:
"From the external objects we see and touch, the text moves inward to
the substances we ingest and, in the final section, outward again to the
spaces that surround us" (<i>MOAM</i>, 127). Weil's graphic accompaniment
moves in the same direction insofar as the etchings in the first section
emphasize linear precision, the enticing colors as well as the presence
of digestive organs in the second suggest ingestion, and the framed
photogravure portraits in the third require a surrounding space. However,
Weil's regularity hardly corresponds to Stein's uneven alignment of texts
ranging from one or two lines to several pages. The first plate assembles
fragments of portraits, derived not only from Picasso's but also from
photographs representing the author. Weil has felicitously juxtaposed and
harmonized details or fragments of these portraits so that the plate as
a whole evokes a cubist engraving. A similar maneuver operates even more
tellingly in the plate immediately preceding <i>Objects</i>, no doubt
because the things displayed in these linear etchings, e.g. fragments of
an umbrella, clockwork, a chair, a cup more clearly approximate cubistic
themes than do parts of the body such as eyes, a nose, or hands. (<A
NAME="5" href="10.4hubert_res.html#5"> 5</a>) More
painterly than those that precede, the second plate in the <i>Rooms</i>
section distances itself somewhat from cubist etching. Stein's frequent
mentions of boxes and other containers amply justify Weil's constricting
squares. In any case, the artist has elaborated an original rendition
of cubist substitution and displacement. The final plate in which
nine photogravures replace etched fragments features framed pictures,
including portraits of Gertrude Stein, art patron and framer of words,
while referring to the cubists' practice of overdetermining inner framing
within their paintings.
<p>
No doubt the repetitions of recognizable fragments from one plate to the
next correspond to Stein's incessant verbal reiterations, substitutions
and exchanges. Even more obviously, the fragments displayed in the
graphics correspond to the various objects and foods mentioned in
<i>Tender Buttons</i>, notably in the titles of individual poems. Words
such as "time," "hour," and especially "change" become visual in the bits
of clockwork that reappear in several plates. Preserved forever in the
etched squares, these clockwork fragments, these frozen moments suggest
measured and spatialized time rather than duration in the Bergsonian sense
of the term. Nonetheless, <i>Tender Buttons</i> also involves experienced
time together with instances of a simultaneous present more easily
expressed in music than in graphic art. Painting as well as cubist collage

<b></b>

can show precise moments in time rather than its passage. It would
seem, therefore, that Weil has captured the immobilized essence of
Stein's text and derived from it a compelling work of art comparable
to the early cubist paintings of Picasso and Braque. Moreover, by
restricting to some extent identity and memory, Weil's fragmentation
would facilitate&#8212;and certainly not preclude&#8212;the creation
of masterpieces.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
However, two fragments featuring handwritten words partly obscured by
shadows clearly introduce process and duration. And the flesh-colored
plate in which the etched fragments tend to infringe upon one
another's borders, clearly imply movement, all the more so because
of the presence of birds in flight, a constant theme in Weil's if not
Stein's repertoire. Here at least, the artist asserts herself alongside
the writer while expressing movement in time. Seven of the etchings,
repeated in the first plate, adorn the binding. The face and hands of
Picasso's portrait appear on the back cover while etchings borrowed
from other sources surround the embossed title on the front cover.

<b></b>

We have the distinct impression that these fragments represent the five
senses: seeing, smelling, and tasting on the front cover, touching and
hearing on the back. And why would Stein close her eyes if not to hear
music? The five senses play conspicuous parts in <i>Tender Buttons</i>.
<p>
Although <i>Tender Buttons</i> clearly shows the influence of early
cubism, Stein, according to Walker, owes just as much to Picasso's and
Braque's collages of 1912 and 1913 that included pieces of newspaper,
oil cloth, tickets, cut-out pictures: mundane objects lifted from the
"real" world (<i>MOAM</i>, 130). The surprising insertion of heterogeneous
found objects into a painterly order has much in common with the verbal
jumbling characteristic of <i>Tender Buttons</i>. Thus, this most orderly
and precise "livre de peintre" takes into account Stein's decentered
and decentering texts. Susan Weil's and Vincent Fitzgerald's bookwork
consists in part of the systematic displacement of graphics submitted
to geometric constraints.
<p>
Whereas the graphics for <i>Tender Buttons</i> and the two versions of
<i>The World is Round</i> overtly relate to the text, we can hardly make
the same claims for the other works we discuss. Spiritual values and
personal feelings inform the works of abstractionists such as Kandinsky
while an inner sense of proportion marks the work of a minimalist such
as Elsworth Kelly.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Since outside objects and events impinge only indirectly on their
paintings and graphics, we can treat their art as a kind of performance
not unlike music. Minimalists and abstractionists have illustrated
literary works with built in programs but so have composers.
<p>
In 1988, Mathew Tyson, like his father, Ian, a noted book artist,
accompanied Gertrude Stein's <i>Five Short War Poems</i> with five
"minimal" hand drawings.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Written in conversational style, these texts dwell typically on an all
encompassing present. As usual, numerous personal pronouns deliberately
elude unambiguous references to specific people, objects, or places. And
Stein relies once again on repetition, alliteration, and rhyme. As the
title indicates, the poems involve war and, if we take a recurrent
language barrier into account, the relationships between American
soldiers and French people&#8212;particularly French women. Instead of
providing direct descriptions of such obvious characteristics of warfare
as horrendous destruction, heroic deeds, and heart-rending lamentations,
Stein by indirection points to recognizable aspects of the situation
of American troops at the front in World War I. More often than not,
she leaves to our imagination whatever horrors may have happened at
the front. In "An "Incident":





<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
<i>Do not be harsh to the misses</i>
<br />
<i>I am full of kisses</i>
<br />
As the soldier said in English the
<br />
Nurses did not understand.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<p>
We can perhaps define the speaker as a battlefield casualty presently
under the care of French nurses. Stein keeps war at a distance in a
systematic state of denial. Nor can we know for certain whether "misses"
refers to "mademoiselles from Armenti&egrave;res" or to bullets that
missed their mark. In other texts, notably "America," Stein relies on

<b></b>

questions: "Are we brave," "Are we true," "Have we red cross."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Although the personal pronoun refers to American soldiers, the identity
of the questioner remains at the very least complex insofar as the
American warriors may, indeed, have asked themselves these questions in
response to French observers, the poet all the while functioning as an
unreliable interpreter, sometimes relying on clich&eacute;s. In several
of the texts, weather plays an important part. Instead of describing
the utter misery of foot soldiers living and dying in muddy trenches,
Stein in "Can you imitate disaster" needs only to mention "Verdun" and
"weather."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
In "America," the suffering and dangers of long marches leading to
confinement in flooded trenches make their presence felt as "A great
many people speak of feet/And socks."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
"Won," which may or may not allude to a triumphant attack by American
forces, features "Aunt Pauline" running out of oil.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
This "Aunt Pauline," the only actant mentioned by name, may designate
the Ford car Stein had ordered from America and that she and Alice
Toklas had put to the service of France. In brief, Stein dwells on
warfare while minimizing its brutal effects. Full of surprises, war
nonetheless always remains the same.
<p>
No less than Stein's poems, Tyson's minimal drawings involve
warfare. Indeed, they evoke the fundamental horror the poet
had so carefully left in abeyance. The pitch black drawings
aggressively connect with atrocities, in the ordinary as
well as the etymological meaning of the term. (<a name="6"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#6"> 6</a>) The very blackness of
the thick drawn lines intensifies their stark evocation of barbed wire,
crosses, and death. The illustrations begin and end with a perfect
circle, not as an indication of the circularity of Stein's world, but
of a kind of illusory completion as negative as barbed wire. We may
wonder why Tyson photocopied and collaged the printed texts onto thick
cardboard paper instead of inscribing them directly on the pages as he
had the drawings. The typography resembles a typescript rather than
proper printing. It puts into sharp relief the minimal drawings that
somehow contain the enshrouded meanings of the poems. The artist has
collaged the titles of these texts at the top and the extreme right of
an otherwise empty page as though to emphasize the typographical poverty
of the following texts, obliged to face the sinister blackness of the
drawings. The artist has avoided all biographical and bibliographical
references concerning the composition and previous publication of the five
poems. In keeping with Stein's pervasive present, Tyson substitutes for
an irrelevant past the omnipresence of death. While evoking implements
of mortality on the battlefield, the drawings have much in common with
penmanship. The hand-drawn and scripted images visually overwhelm the
neutral typescript.
<p>
In spite of all these differences, author and artist stand in relationship
to war and reality at about the same distance. Tyson's minimal drawings
and Stein's understated texts have little in common with descriptive
representations of World War I, either graphic or literary. But artist
and writer display similar powers of evocation and may have provided
the reader with a deeper understanding of war than many a blow by blow
account.
<p>
A "minimalist" quite different from Tyson, for she favors pure color,
Aur&eacute;lie Nemours, a well known painter who exhibits at the Denise
Ren&eacute; gallery in Paris, chose "Early and Late," a poem written in
1925 and published in 1953 in <i>Bee Time Vine</i>.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<b></b>

The graphics consist of seven "Bleischnitte," similar to woodcuts:
four large squares each of a single color: blue, black, yellow and
red, two small black and yellow squares placed side by side, two small
blue and red squares placed one above the other, and a large square
assembling the four small squares. However attractive, these colorful
squares have very little in common with Stein's repetitious and rhythmic
writing, particularly in evidence in a free verse poem such as "Early
and Late." Nonetheless, the four colors may correspond to the four
characters who play the most important roles in the poem: Celestine,
Paul, Eugene, and Esther. Mentioned only once, Odile, Bonnington and
Jo, by joining the four protagonists, attain the number seven thus
accounting, so to speak, for the seven engravings. We may discover
a deeper correspondence between the images and the poem in the fact
that all the squares, even when printed on the same page, never touch
one another. This deliberate separation corresponds to "Early and Late"
where separation predominates, particularly in the wording of the title,
often repeated in the text. Moreover, Stein multiplies divisions

<b></b>

and separations not only in time but in everything else. And to complicate
matters still further, she introduces a number of contradictions and
paradoxes. Two words: "bridge" and "connect" provide, or so it would seem,
a mitigating factor insofar as they run counter to separation. However,
bridging and connecting must inevitably fail in a poem entitled
"Early and Late." They perform asymptotically in their failure to reach
their goal. In this respect, we might regard Nemours' accompaniment as
anti-illustration. Indeed, she creates a kind of spiritual order quite
removed not only from the real world but also from any overt meanings.
<p>
The loose leaf volume itself, and not only the imagery, emphasizes
separation. Printed in small capitals and punctuated by periods, the
English text on the left confronts Helmut Heissenb&uuml;ttel's German
translation on the right. Printed in regular typography, the unpunctuated
German text defies convention by eschewing all capital letters. However,
indentations indicate the divisions into paragraphs and sentences of
Stein's poem. By a strange reversal of normal indentation, each new
paragraph starts far back in the margin. Grouped together, the colored
squares follow the English and German texts but precede de la Tour's
French translation, the only text printed in the expected manner. In other
words, separation and differentiation characterize the various aspects
of the volume that by means of clever bookwork becomes an ideal recipient
for "Early and Late." Rather than referring to the poem as such, the four
colors may represent the four creators: Stein, Heissenb&uuml;ttel, de la
Tour, and Nemours herself. However, by frustrating an analytical approach
in favor of a meditative appreciation, Nemours' colored squares may
induce a receptive mood on the part of readers of Stein's hermetic text.
<p>
Irma Blank, a prolific book artist, published in 1994 in Livorno <i>No
Words,</i> a small book, tightly bound, in which the abundant whiteness
of both the binding and the Japanese folded pages contrasts with black
typography and illegible script.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
As her other books demonstrate, the artist shows an irresistible
attraction toward Mallarm&eacute;'s blank pages. Based on Gertrude
Stein's <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>, <i>No Words</i>, elegantly
printed in Garamond lettering by a skilled typographer, qualifies as
an artist book insofar as Blank has assumed multiple tasks.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
In addition to functioning as inventor and designer, she performs
as a reader and a writer&#8212;as a reader because the pages on
the left side display selections from Gertrude Stein's second
autobiography, as a writer because she transcribes on the
right side what we as readers identify with Stein's texts as a
wordless and illegible but highly regular script. (<a name="7"
href="10.4hubert_res.html#7"> 7</a>) An Italian translation
of the Stein selections appears at the end of the book as though
Blank wanted her Italian readers to know something about <i>Everybody's
Autobiography</i>. The colophon mentions 963 available volumes in arabic
numerals and 36 in Roman in addition to an original work by Irma Blank,
thus confirming her identity as an artist.
<p>
<i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> provides voluminous accounts, personal
historical, and sociological. It features strong contrasts while
conveying a wider field of awareness than the <i>Autobiography of Alice
B. Toklas</i>.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> might at first seem incompatible with
Blank's miniature and impersonal volume which has inherited

<b></b>

some of Mallarm&eacute;'s transcendentalism. The Italian artist
usually selects short passages from the autobiography without
disturbing the author's order, thus assuring a rather unified and one
directional process. Although the chosen passages, paragraphs, and
sentences reveal the breadth of Stein's interests, Blank tends to omit
narrative and reduces the anecdotal and even the ironic side of the
autobiography. Moreover, the personalities of the artists frequented
by Stein fade into the background. Judging by Stein's title alone, one
might infer that individuality and identity rather than universality
form the crux of her autobiographical book, an inference that the
extracts fail to confirm. Reflections on artistic production as well as
comparisons between writing and painting surface here and there in <i>No
Words</i>. It would seem that Blank appropriates Stein's text by stressing
what she considers essential and by assuming the role of "Everybody" while
asserting herself through daring and skillful manipulation. She joins
Gertrude Stein's "Everybody" while creating her own unrepeatable style
of continuous, letterless, wordless but rhythmic penmanship. Curtailment
has resulted in radical changes by giving greater esthetic consistency
to a text that deliberately proceeds in a multiplicity of directions and
indirections. Willfully or not, Blank, even if she has disposed only of
the left sides of the pages, has created her own emphasis and shifted

<b></b>

toward her own credo. In addition to challenging Stein's loquacious
sequel to <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> with her brief
selections or digest, she has substituted for Stein as an author writing
in a readable language an illegible continuum. Perhaps she has striven
for a non-referential language, far closer to graphics than to prose or
poetry. In her own script, she has forsaken any possibility of linking
up with Stein or even with "Everybody."
<p>
Can we consider Blank's inscription an attempt at modernization by its
quasi mechanical regularity? Such an attempt would mean that she has
distanced herself from the original text even further than Broodthaers in
his reduction of <i>Un Coup de d&eacute;s</i> to a byplay of concealing
lines.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
The transformation of an autobiographical text into an unrelieved
visual continuum has limitations insofar as Blank, while distancing
herself from the literary and linguistic side of Stein's text, may
have deliberately neglected to assert herself fully as a visual artist,
either modern or postmodern. She has merely appended a signature that
prolongs itself as long as the author's words move along on the opposite
page. Its inevitable curtailment abolishes Blank's ambition to make
<i>No Words</i> at once "Everybody"'s and her own autobiography. In so
doing, Blank has revealed in her own way the meaning of Stein's title:
an author who attributed her creativity alternatively to Alice B. Toklas
and to "Everybody" although we can hardly regard the lifestyle of this
self-proclaimed but ironic genius as modest and self-effacing. Whereas
Hurd, Hoyem, Weil, and even Tyson, in their interpretations of Stein's
texts, aimed at showing some sort of correspondence between text and
image, Blank pursued a quite different goal, that of appropriation,
in turning a radically reduced text into a new book.
<p>
Shirley Sharoff harmoniously combines abstract etching with intricate
bookwork. Her endeavor in "Procession" strikes us as somewhat more
complex than those of other illustrators insofar as she succeeds in
deriving from a short text a full-fledged artist book departing in new
ways from standard practice.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Accompanied neither by a definite or indefinite article, the title
discourages the reader from singling out a specific procession or
looking for a representative model. Rather, the unaccompanied noun
multiplies possibilities while discouraging description. Far from
programming scenes and pictures, the title word immediately joins
forces, either by sound or etymology, with terms such as "possession"
and "process." Such alliances and affinities mark the poem throughout
for Stein has indeed created a progression of rhymes and repetitions.
<p>
Like several texts of <i>Tender Buttons</i>, "Procession" compounds
prose and poetry without subscribing to the usual practices of prose
or poetry. Nor does it proceed in a linear or other predictable
fashion. Readers will at no stage focus on a given procession. The
very first word, an imperative, "proceed," will, when obeyed, set the
whole process&#8212;we the readers included&#8212;into motion. Movement,
of course, inevitably functions as an indispensable aspect not only of
processions, but also of writing and reading. The initiating command will
soon give way to spontaneity, the triumphant other, in Gertrude Stein's
work, of ordering. So as to adjust to Stein's processional procedures,
we have to abandon all hope of finding a fixed location or a reliable
point of

<b></b>

view. Alternating between the one and the many, Stein's procession
generates movements in a multiplicity of straight, bent, circular, and
zigzag (in)directions. Faced with the improbability that immobility
has set itself in motion, we can assume that Stein has secretly
maneuvered among several processions in space and time both as a viewer
and a participant. Additions, substitutions, adjustments, and even
defections function as basic elements in a procession. But the question
of multiplicity and singleness, so Stein suggests, involves various
presences and absences within the procession. Plurality implies at the
very least the possibility of arrivals and departures, full, partial
and/ or intermittent, dependent and/ or autonomous. The author looks at,
speaks about, views, and catches many participants in the parade. Everyday
consumer products such as "oil" and "cheese" intersect and interact with
concerns about language. We can regard these concrete and mental aspects
as appropriate to a procession. A crowd of personal pronouns which,
more often than not, avoid specific designations of people or objects,
serve mainly to increase and expand relationships. By performing both
as a direct and an indirect voice in the poem, the author plays an
assortment of active and passive roles, and nothing prevents her from
substituting one personal pronoun for another. The participants designated
by nouns and pronouns do not necessarily belong to humanity. Sheep, even
furry sheep, as well as other animals provide suitably woolgathering
examples. This neglect of barriers adds ironic twists and turns to the
procession. Family relationships and even surprising political accusations
involving warfare compound the range of possibilities. The parts of
the poem, whether divided or not by numbers, bear little resemblance to
each other. Numbers suggest an operative organizing principle, but it
so happens that Stein herself deliberately undermines every expectation
of continuity and coherence with the notable exception of sound patterns
that transform the procession into a mock-processional.
<p>
Rather than a coherent chronicle of an outward event, Stein provides
us with suggestions concerning her struggle as a writer, a sporadic
and always unfulfilled but nonetheless satisfying battle. Occurring
far apart from one another, "bestow" and "possession" increase our
awareness of the impact of Stein's procession of words always surging
into view but always lagging behind, necessarily overtaken, outstripped,
and otherwise removed by an absolute present. Throughout the poem, the
author proposes and immediately discourages the establishment of expected
or even unexpected links between past and present. Occurring toward the
end of the text, the terms "success" and "succeed" appear particularly
revealing. Although they invariably question or postpone meaning in
relation to events or situations, these two terms as well as "follow" and
"replace" ironically assert their double allegiance. From the standpoint
of creative affabulation, such deliberate hesitations and shifts lead to
the opposition or reconciliation of "fact or fiction." Truth can never
accede to certainty. Fumbling for expressions and shuttling between
different possibilities always raise new counterproposals and retorts
far more evocative than direct solutions that might put an end to the
esthetic search. Energy will prevent the arrest and confinement of the
animated procession. "Procession" gives evidence of the special kind of
realism that, according to Lynn Hejinian, marks the writing of <i>Tender
Buttons</i>. Elements of a felt and perceived reality

<b></b>

and words considered an "order of reality," all of them placed on the
same footing, assemble and march along in "Procession."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Printed on v&eacute;lin d'arches, Shirley Sharoff's <i>Procession</i>
displays many features of "livres de peintres," including a detailed
colophon. Housed like many "livres de peintres" and a few artists'
books, Shirley Sharoff's edition of "Procession" demands on the part of
the reader and viewer attentive care in opening it. Sharoff rightfully
implies that far from reducing our viewing and reading of such a book to
a casual encounter, we should wind our way toward it. Refraining from
binding the text and the engravings together, the artist has enclosed
loose leaves in a solid box. She no doubt felt that a glued or sewn text
would hardly suit Stein's loosely formed, detached, and free moving
procession. Although the text never departs from the one originally
printed in <i>Programme</i>, it strikes us as quite different. Intricate
typography and spacing replace ordinary linear printing. Every page,
every paragraph, every sentence has freed itself from the conventions of
continuous alignment. Each passage imposes its own spacing and, thereby,
its own shape, thus avoiding any resemblance to a typical page image. Not
only has Sharoff added etchings to the text and, in collaboration with
the master printer Da Ros, created unique typographical arrangements
in shaping a unique kind of artist book, but she has included a French
translation. While making the book available to a French public, it also
extended the typographical domain of Sharoff's <i>Procession</i> as the
setting of the French text by no means follows that of the English. While
the translator has semantically and even phonetically done full justice
to Stein's writing, the French no less than the English text asserts
its own patterns in harmony with one another. By behaving like dancing
partners keeping in step with one another, they form an ordered procession
contrasting with the seeming disorder of Stein's text. Indeed, we can
hardly regard Sharoff's postmodern bookwork as subservient.
<p>
Almost every page displays an etching accompanying a printed section. The
book features five black and white grids inscribed directly on the page
and all of them, with the exception of the slightly truncated final
one, complete and nine mostly colored fragmentary images printed on
small squares of paper and pasted onto the page. Varying from etching
to etching, coloring serves to highlight the separations between
the different patches whereas the black and white grids show greater
unity and cohesion because of the relative absence of open or blank
spaces. Two or three assemblages of fragments precede the completed
etching as though in the act of forming a procession or moving toward
it. We might infer that the embedded grids firmly etched into the page
mark a fixed emplacement within which the mostly colored and purportedly
mobile fragments seek a location. Perhaps they metamorphose into the
embossed white lines seemingly tracing pathways through each completed
engraving. Etchings placed within a book in relation to the given text
appear to function as illustration. But in <i>Procession</i>, we can
hardly trace back any of the images, whether complete or fragmentary,
to a given passage in the poem. Indeed, we can hardly consider any of
them visual equivalents of verbal constructs. We may wonder, however,
whether the very avoidance of objective references in the poem's various
levels of concreteness finds an echo in the complex lines and map-like
designs as well as in the repeated numeration and

<b></b>

lettering of the etchings. The numerals and letters we can so easily
identify in the engravings flaunt the same lack of referentiality as
Stein's personal pronouns. But perhaps letters and numbers substitute
for the various aspects of reality positively or negatively alluded
to in the text. In any case, we search in vain for people and sheep,
for oil and cheese in these abstract graphics where jumbled numbers and
letters fulfill at the very least a visual function.
<p>
Sharoff has emphasized repetition in her graphic accompaniment. Although
hardly identical to one another, the black and white etchings display
many similarities. A comparison among them reveals intricate patterns
of changing lines and movements as well as different divisions. Because
the density of lines, hatchings, letters, and numbers varies from plate
to plate, we might even see them as a juxtaposition of regions through
which the procession must proceed. Nonetheless, the etchings may very
well combine the procession with its succession of emplacements since
we may regard the fragments themselves as locations set in motion. The
lack of clearly definable barriers between place and procession appears
highly suitable to a poem that so often negates the constructs it has
just proposed. Moreover, within the completed plates an emphasis on
straightness contrasts with the irregular curved embossing dividing
each one while gaps tend to separate fragments from one another. In
comparing these fragments to the complete engraving where each one will
relocate, we immediately realize that the placements of the former
within the glued on square in no way correspond to their final black
and white insertion in the completed plate. And it takes a rewarding
effort on the part of the viewer to follow each fragment to its final
destination. We might even claim that the twisting and turning progression
of the fragments characterizes the twists and turns that mark Stein's
procession and process, which must of course come to an end if not a
conclusion. Sharoff shows her awareness of this inevitable outcome by
ending her graphic accompaniment with a cutout, also suggesting absence,
through which emerges a section of Da Ros's typography. (<a name="8"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#8"> 8</a>)
<p>
We now return to the very beginning of <i>Procession</i> which,
as soon as we remove the loose-leaf volume from its red enclosure,
greets us with cutouts of a different sort. (<a name="9"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#9"> 9</a>) At first we view, in
lieu of a proper title page, <i>Procession</i> printed in large ornate
characters setting an elegantly meandering itinerary from top to bottom
and from left to right. This title occupies parts of six sinuous strips of
paper, three of which unfold at the top of the book and three on the left
side. We can still read the title with the left strips unfolded but in
three different types consisting of the four remaining ornate capitals,
of two roman capitals, and of three lower case roman letters. It so
happens that this "title page" cut from two sheets provides a preview
of the entire volume. The divided title moves from a striking design
to a surprising assemblage of conflicting but nonetheless meaningful
lettering. The six sinuous strips evoke a procession moving in different
directions. Viewed as a whole, these strips not only display the title,
but the numerous divisions thus formed have much in common with the
shaped fragments in search of an emplacement. Not only do the fancy
letters defy linearity, but they stage a spectacular performance worthy
of Stein's statement concluding Part I: "That is a beautiful procession
and full of meaning too." And thus, even

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 697]</b>

before we reach the first page of the volume, we realize that we cannot
view a page as a unity and that we shall have to deal with complexity
and multiplicity.
<p>
All aspects of the book&#8212;the title page, the plates, the typography,
the accompanying translation, and even the final cutout&#8212;refer
in one way or another to a procession without any need to mimic the
various scenarios of Gertrude Stein's poem. Moreover, the ever moving
plates, by the denial of the inevitable fixity of book illustrations
and by the interference of a French text, simultaneously reproducing
and differing from the original, somehow remain in keeping with Stein's
quirky but marvelously effective approach to writing. Shirley Sharoff has
converted Stein's methodology and modernist liberation from conventions
into a graphic performance consisting of a coherent series of abstract
constructions.
<p>
Barbara Fahrner has contributed her share to the development of "livres
de peintres" in America by illustrating texts by Schwitters and Celan
for Granary books. Her graphic accompaniment of <i>4 Poems</i> of Celan
consists of a transcription and mise-en-sc&egrave;ne rather than an
illustration of the texts.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
In her one-of-a-kind book devoted to "Parlor," Fahrner has in a similar
manner provided a mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and staging of Stein's short play.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
As a dramatist, Stein more often than not dispenses with the usual
accoutrements of playwriting such as dialogue, plot, clearly defined
characters and recognizable settings. By mentioning the two spellings
of "parlo(u)r" she insists on the importance of writing. Rather than
as theater, we can define them as plays on words and situations. The
title lends itself to semantic displacements. It can refer to a typical
lower middle-class parlor located in Lynn, Massachusetts, belonging to
two sisters who presumably receive therein cousins and friends. But
it can also refer to a "parloir", for instance the one belonging to
the convent of "Les S&#156;urs de Saint Vincent de Paul," located rue
du Bac next to "Le Bon March&eacute;"&#8212;a short walk from Stein's
apartment rue de Fleurus.
<p>
Although the two New England siblings named Earle have little to do
with convent sisters, Stein constantly throws them together only to pull
them asunder a sentence or so later. Nonetheless, they do share certain
characteristics: the Earle sisters, who hardly belong to the aristocracy,
face poverty while the nuns have vowed to remain poor. But we cannot
limit the meaning of parlor to emplacement since the etymology of the
word stresses conversation. In many convents, the nuns could converse
only in the "parloir." In any case, Stein throughout the play compounds
the spatial and conversational meanings of "parlor" in the same way that
she lumps together the inseparable Earle siblings and a community of
"S&#156;urs de la Charit&eacute;." As sundering and joining together
mark the entire play as well as Fahrner's mise-en-sc&egrave;ne, parlor
functions in the manner of a pun whose dissonant meanings preclude
stability. Thanks to the substitution of "and" for "de" the saintly
founder of "les s&#156;urs de la charit&eacute;" divides&#8212;or
proliferates&#8212;into two saints: Vincent and Paul, who, with "Sister
Peter," provide masculine names for three of the nuns. Moreover, all these
disparate sisters can metamorphose into roses: "The seven sisters." By
such means, Stein has eliminated any danger of stability and fixity. In
this respect, she emulates Saint Vincent de Paul whose nomadic

<b></b>

nuns did not at first reside in a convent or need a "parloir." Seemingly
arbitrary, but nonetheless relevant displacements of various sorts,
predominate. We learn, for instance, that "Louise Henry Earle was not
born in Texas but in Lynn Massachusetts." And just before evoking
the nuns, Stein interpolates: "I am grateful to the Uruguan. This
is a saying." Does the author show gratitude for a geographical or
a verbal displacement or reveal once again the self-referentiality
of her composition? In any case, spatial and verbal accumulations and
dispersions follow one another during the entire play. We move from the
restricting quarters of a nondescript New England parlor circa 1897 to
the equally restrictive but nominally far more charitable "parloir" in
a convent. But the movement itself&#8212;the displacement&#8212;matters
most of all because of the mercurial interrelationships brought about
by language, the only operative commodity. As usual, Stein adds inner
displacements to the more overt sort by bringing in failures of memory:
"The Earle sisters have now been forgotten just as a memory." And memory
produces a displacement by ironically creating a cleavage between the
performative play and the situation of the writer: "It is difficult to
remember anything oh how difficult."
<p>
As her title indicates, Barbara Fahrner has provided a
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and thus more than an illustration of, or, as had
Elie Lascaux, a setting for, Gertrude Stein's play. This title appears
all the more appropriate insofar as Stein in so many of her writings
creates, as Jacky Martin states, "une mise en sc&egrave;ne du langage"
in which words operate like actants in a spectacle.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Indeed, Stein, notably in her plays, <i>Tender Buttons</i>, and
"Procession," drastically reduces the distances separating words,
characters, objects, and feelings. The mottled gray elongated cover of
Fahrner's <i>Parlor</i>, stitched down the middle with black thread,
suggests a stage curtain while evoking the divisions and separations
prevalent in both the text and its graphic staging. The fragments of a
column on the back and front covers may evoke a stage proscenium or even
the theater itself. When we open the volume, we notice immediately that
the gutter separating the two facing pages allows textual and graphic
crossovers in keeping with Stein's numerous verbal displacements. The
neatly handwritten script of "Play," moving horizontally from one side
of the double page to the other, must compete with an ineligible text,
couched in a sort of microwriting by the same hand, and spiraling crazily
in an upward direction. However, Fahrner's name appears together with
the date of composition embedded in four horizontal lines featuring
incipient or minimal microwriting. We can conclude that the purely
visual script bridges the gap between text and graphics all the more
so because the linear drawings themselves resemble writing. Fragmented
black and red lines follow, but with greater regularity, the mostly
perpendicular direction of the microwriting. Together, they form porous
enclosures vaguely suggesting a parlor and, paradoxically, a face,
perhaps that of a sibling or a nun. (.<a name="0" href="10.4hubert_res.html#0"> 10</a> &amp;   <a name="1" href="10.4hubert_res.html#1">11</a>) We may also
regard the blotches of solid color, some of them shaped like maps, that
greet the reader on each double page as marking the fleeting presence
of the two Earle sisters and the three named nuns. In any case, persons
and places appear to coalesce in these undefined res. Friends and
cousins, together with their places of origin, emerge in the guise of
partially colored blotches. Fahrner has introduced

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 700]</b>

in addition geometrical and architectural shapes in keeping with the
drawing on the title page, evoking, or so it seems, aspects of a parlor,
a house, a theater, or a convent.
<p>
Known as a penetrating reader of texts, Fahrner has succeeded in
dramatizing the salient aspects of Stein's purely verbal play. While
the blotches may refer to the indescribable characters in "Parlor,"
it would seem that the microwriting, in addition to its

<b></b>

structural function, represents the unreported conversations taking place
in the Earle sisters' parlor and the nuns' "parloir," and even the funeral
parlor where his daughters transported Mr. Earle. And the Earle sisters
may even have joined their dad: "The Earle sisters have now been forgotten
just as a memory" ("P," 328). In this manner, Fahrner has succeeded in
concretizing Stein's technique of compounding and collapsing persons and
places. The artist faithfully copies Stein's self-referential text while
repeating throughout the mute utterances of the characters. Similarly,
the artist's porous enclosures combine distance and separation with
close encounters in a room. Like Stein, who implies that the Earles
may not have a parlor or even a house but only a vacant lot, Fahrner by
means of her open-ended spaces suggests that the Earles may not have a
residence of their own. And like the author, the artist equates there
with nowhere and all over as well as proximity with distance.
<p>
Fahrner conveys Stein's negativity by means of emptiness. For instance,
the porous enclosures contain no more than other lines and shapes
repeating one another from page to page. As in the text, repetition
appears everywhere in the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. Fahrner has inscribed
her and Stein's name some six times on the first and last pages as
well as on the title page and the cover. The artist has matched the
author's playful sonorities by a harmonious succession of colored shapes
and enclosures. And by elongating the grid, she has captured the very
movement of Stein's writing. Indeed, a paradoxical sense of continuity
marks the text and the graphics, both of them rich in non-sequiturs.
<p>
As had all image makers since the invention of the codex and until Sonia
Delaunay's and Blaise Cendrars' <i>La Prose du Transsib&eacute;rien et
de la petite Jehane de France</i>, Hurd sought to enhance reading by
providing plausible representations of some of the events and people
described.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
We usually judge these representational graphics in terms of their
fidelity to the text and their artistic interest which, in some
cases, notably the Curmer edition of <i>Paul et Virginie</i>, whose
illustrators transformed Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's sentimental tale
into a masterpiece.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Abstract and minimal graphics have a far different effect on
readers. Indeed, abstract paintings&#8212; grids&#8212;erect, as Rosalind
Krauss states, a wall between art and language.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Nonetheless, many abstractionists and even minimalists have
contributed graphic accompaniments to texts, usually to the poetry
they admired. Rather than representations or commentaries on the text,
these graphics by disorienting at first readers and viewers tend to
increase their awareness. By challenging our understanding, these
abstract images induce us to decipher not only the images themselves
but also to question the text. We thus must confront juxtaposed and
equally hermetic signifiers. And bookwork compounds this situation
insofar as both the graphics and the text play subordinate parts in an
emerging structure as Fahrner in her mise en sc&egrave;ne, Sharoff in
her systematic displacements, and Blank in her radical reduction have
shown. By combining abstraction with representation, Weil has succeeded
in enhancing our appreciation of Stein's text without reducing its
hermeticism. This purposefully elaborated structure requires increased
participation and even collaboration on the part of the reader in the
creating of a new and complex art form.

<b></b>

<p>
As a rule, artists, mimetic or other, give close readings of the
texts they illustrate and thus have much in common with critics
and translators. Literary critics can glean invaluable information
by comparing the poem they wish to explicate to a translation. The
displacements and substitutions they uncover in the translation can lead
to surprising discoveries in the original. Graphic accompaniments can
lead to new (mis)understandings in much the same way as translations
for they thrive even more than verbal translation on substitutions
and displacements while proposing, if not an equivalence, at least
a meaningful dialogue between verbal and visual signifiers. While
abundant mimetic illustrations such as those of nineteenth-century
novels prevail upon readers to adopt the point of view of the artists,
modern and postmodern graphic commentaries tend to problematize the text
and thus to complicate rather than impose an interpretation.
<p>
By stressing the playfulness and astute childishness of <i>The World
is Round</i> for the benefit of young readers, Clement Hurd highlights
features only vaguely perceived in Stein's books for grownups, for
instance in the frequently humorous <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>. The
geometrical precision and impressive craftsmanship of Vincent Fitzgerald's
and Susan Weil's <i>Tender Buttons</i> contrasts with the apparently
haphazard associations and puzzling syntax of Gertrude Stein's poems. By
suggesting that some hidden order underlies the texts, this "livre
de peintre" encourages a new approach modeled on Weil's systematic
displacements and exchanges of fragments which seemingly correspond to
recurrent transformations in Stein's text. Tyson's cruelly incisive lines
point to the underlying horrors of war in Stein's apparently mild war
poems while Nemours' minimalist colors and the three different printings
of the text focus the reader's attention on the divisions and separations
featured in "Early and Late." Irma Blank's radical abridgement of the
text and her wordless cursive writing radically distance themselves from
the voluble <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>. The sharp contrast between
<i>No Words</i> and <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> suggests that Stein
may have proceeded by increments without any thought of eliminating
anything whatsoever. Stein, indeed, deliberately delays completed
meaning and thus pleasurably induces the reader to discover the path
through a plethora of words. Sharoff's complex treatment of "Procession"
attracts our attention to Stein's displaced syntax which serves to bring
the world simultaneously closer and more distant. And Fahrner induces
us to see "Parlor" as a fully-fledged play performed in a theater thus
conforming to Stein's statement in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>: ". . . whenever I write a play it is a play because it is a thing I do not
see but it is a thing somebody can see that is what makes a play for me."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
It would thus appear that visual readings can produce the same sort
of effects as critical commentaries while adding to the pleasures of
reading by means of inventive bookwork.

<p>
The Florida James Joyce Series, under the general editorship of the
formidable Zack Bowen, can claim much of the credit for the flourishing
North American "Joyce Industry," as it is sometimes fondly, sometimes
maliciously named. Both in convivial annual conferences in Miami,
thoughtfully planned to coincide with Joyce's birthday in frosty February,
and in the building of a Joyce list for Florida University Press, Joyce
scholarship in the United States has blossomed in the last decade,
a trend that shows little sign of reversal. The year 2002 saw five
monographs on Joyce from the Florida series, an increase in the usual
annual three. This increase is perhaps attributable to a heightened level
of interest during the buildup to the Bloomsday centenary celebrations
next year. Three of them are reviewed here, and each concentrates on
issues currently to the fore in Joyce scholarship: Joyce's treatment
of gender and sexuality; his relationship to Ireland, nationalism and
postcolonialism; his position within the cultures of modernism.
<p>
Kimberly Devlin's <i>James Joyce's "Fraudstuff"</i>is an eagerly
awaited book from one of the liveliest current thinkers on the tricky
and notoriously vexed subject of Joyce's sexual politics. It indicates
the level of interest in Devlin's work that four of the six chapters have
been partially published elsewhere; their collection together here allows
readers to appreciate the overall densely woven coherence of her argument.

<b></b>

Devlin's notion of "fraudstuff" is borrowed from <i>Finnegans Wake</i>,
and she takes it as shorthand for "an increasing concern of Joyce's
canon as a whole, his growing interest in fraudulent being and the
various theatrical props that support identity" (xi). Such a fascination
with inauthenticity and masquerade develops during the later Joyce, as
the writer moves away from his earlier <i>Dubliners</i> preoccupation
with the authentic. This preoccupation is signified both in his famous
declaration to reflect back to the Irish people a mirror image of their
own paralysis in <i>Dubliners</i>'"nicely polished looking glass," and
in the stories' dependence on blinding moments of authentic revelation,
the Joycean "epiphany."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Instead, Devlin suggests, Joyce's later writing transforms that nicely
polished looking glass into what Stephen Dedalus would later term "the
cracked looking glass of a servant," a mirror which refracts, distorts,
parodies, and celebrates its own inaccuracies of representation.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Devlin's hypothesis appears immediately convincing; all the more so when
she applies it to that most performative of all identity poses, gender.
<p>
<i>James Joyce's "Fraudstuff"</i> begins with an ingenious analysis of
the transition between the early Joyce fragment <i>Stephen Hero</i>and the
novel it would eventually become, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man</i>. The earlier Stephen rails against "mummery," whether he finds
it in the Catholic piety or the idealistic Gaelic League nationalism of
his fellow students. Accordingly, "mummery" is not a quality to be found
in the self: the Stephen of <i>Stephen Hero</i> delivers a "seriously
intended" lecture on art, and provides an eloquent undergraduate theory of
"epiphanies," both intellectual stances validated by their rejection by
an inherently fraudulent Ireland (Devlin, 7). Yet in <i>A Portrait</i>
and in <i>Ulysses</i>, the young Stephen's reliance upon masks and
disguise becomes more pronounced until he mutates in <i>Finnegans Wake</i>
into Shem the Penman, a plagiaristic, inauthentic author-persona whose
degenerate "squidself" gleefully delights in "cuttlefishing every lie
unshrinkable about all the other people in the story" (<i>Finnegans
Wake</i>, 173-4).
<p>
This first chapter acts as the overture for the rest of the book, which
explores through several brilliant close readings Joyce's increasingly
sophisticated exploration of what modern identity is. A genuinely
fruitful use of psychoanalysis, particularly Joan Riviere's seminal essay
"Femininity and the Masquerade," introduces considerations of both the
ambivalent gender identity of Leopold Bloom, Joyce's "new womanly man"
(<i>U</i> 15: 1798-9), and the strikingly theatrical manipulations of
femininity performed by, firstly, Gerty MacDowell, and secondly, Molly
Bloom. Devlin's reading of Gerty through her namesake Gertrude Flint,
the heroine of the sentimental bestseller <i>The Lamplighter</i>by Maria
Susannah Cummins, is particularly deft, as Devlin explores how Gerty's
colored narrative artfully veers between one inauthentic intertext and
another&#8212;the self-consciously artful advertizing copy of contemporary
women's magazines. Devlin reads both Molly Bloom's own adroitness at
putting on an act&#8212;"doing the indifferent"&#8212;and her ability
to perceive inauthenticity in others in an illuminating context. She
notes Molly's similarity in this regard to another of <i>Ulysses 's</i>
conspicuously unstable personalities, the nameless and evasive narrator
of the "Cyclops" episode. Two closing chapters explore Bloom's fantastic
posturings beneath the imagined surveillant gaze of Dublin's ubiquitous
police presence, and the perplexing blurring of both gender and sexuality
in <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, where male sartorial exhibitionism repeatedly
and compromisingly masks misshapen and taboo bodies and desires. As
Devlin's elegant afterword explains, Joyce's worlds of masquerade,
disguise and fraudulence are increasingly predicated upon complex
conrations of the eye, the gaze and spectacle. <i>Finnegans Wake</i>,
with its nightscape of voyeuristic scenarios and ceaselessly shifting
identities, is thus Joyce's ultimate exercise in "fraudstuff."
<p>
Andras Ungar's <i>Ulysses as National Epic</i> offers an important
investigation of the ramifications of a historical coincidence too
often overlooked in Joyce studies. <i>Ulysses 's</i> publication in 1922
collided with the foundation of the Irish Free State, and accordingly
Ungar reads the novel as an epic of the birth of a new nation. Drawing
on recent critical interest in Joyce's formative years in Trieste, Ungar
stresses how much of <i>Ulysses</i> was composed while its author also
came to political consciousness lecturing and writing on Ireland for the
newspaper <i>Il Piccolo Della Sera</i>. While Joyce's journalism and
lectures reveal his acute interest in events in Ireland following the
Easter Rising, particularly the rise of Sinn F&eacute;in and its policy
of secession, Ungar also emphazises how Trieste's colonized status as
part of the Austro-Hungarian empire provoked in Joyce an acute awareness
of the political parallels between Hungary's position within that empire,
and Ireland's relationship to Britain.

<b></b>

<p>
As Joyce freely acknowledges, such a comparison had been originally noted
in Arthur Griffith's 1904 <i>Resurrection of Hungary</i>, where Griffith
suggested Ireland look to the continent for a model for the strategy
of nationalist resistance he inaugurated the following year with the
foundation of Sinn F&eacute;in. Yet Ungar's rigorous close readings
of key episodes in <i>Ulysses</i> explore how integral Griffith's
Hungarian parallel was to the novel, as "the epic design of the work
formulates a comprehensive reflection on the historical conjunction
that in 1904 signalled the prospect of future Irish independence from
Britain" . To argue for this parallel is not, as Ungar stresses,
to suggest that Joyce either actively endorses Griffith's and Sinn
F&eacute;in's physical force brand of Irish nationalism, or overlooks
the less salubrious aspects of Griffith's program, most notably his
anti-Semitism. Rather, <i>Ulysses</i> emerges from the "raw material"
of Irish and Hungarian politics as a fable centred on Stephen Dedalus
and Leopold Bloom and dramatizing through its epic form the processes
both of nation formation and historiography.
<p>
This densely written study provides many startlingly new insights
into the tangled relationships between fiction, history and allegory in
<i>Ulysses</i>. Ungar's exploration of Stephen and Bloom's relationship in
the context of the competing two crowns of the Austro-Hungarian empire,
the crown of St. Stephen and the crown of St. Leopold, is striking both
in its ingeniousness and in the common sense of Ungar's suggestion that
the allegory is suggested only to imply in turn the strain of the unreal
universality such an allegory requires. The tension between individual
and nation, epic fable and history, is, Ungar argues, the message behind
Joyce's appropriation of the Homeric genre.
<p>
David Spurr's <i>Joyce and the Scene of Modernity</i> seems much less
coherent in its argument and focus than either Devlin's or Ungar's
studies. It is, as Zack Bowen's foreword puts it, "essentially a
miscellany of nine essays," a curious statement since I could only find
seven. The book suffers from its miscellaneous nature, although there
is much to commend in individual chapters, three of which have been
published elsewhere. The first chapter on "Colonial Spaces in Joyce's
Dublin" offers a deft reading of Joyce in the context of a Dublin
where colonial history has been liberally inscribed through the city's
architecture. To Spurr, "Joyce conceives of the city as a contested
space of imperfectly accomplished colonial domination" (Spurr, 17),
and his discussion of the "Wandering Rocks" episode offers a compelling
interpretation of the various highly ironic and frequently misinterpreted
gestures of loyalty towards the viceregal cavalcade. One chapter
examines <i>Finnegans Wake' s</i> frequent allusions to the infamous
1887 <i>Times</i> forgeries of letters linking Charles Stewart Parnell
to the Phoenix Park assassinations. It allows Spurr to blend historicism
with a Derridean meditation on forgery to show, as Devlin shows, that
questions of authenticity are at the heart of Joyce's final novel.
<p>
One of the strengths of <i>Joyce and the Scene of Modernity</i> lies
in its attempt to situate Joyce within an alternative continental
modernism, and, accordingly, two chapters compare Joyce with Proust
and Mallarm&eacute;. The Proust comparison is an intriguing one often
skirted around by Joyce scholars as Joyce's one encounter with Proust
was notoriously unproductive. Both men complained about their health
and denied that each had read the other's work. Acknowledging that "in
comparing Joyce's work to Proust's, one cannot speak of 'influence'"
, Spurr instead compares both writers' treatment of the relationship
between anti-Semitism and sexuality. What is otherwise a fruitful
comparison is unfortunately let down here by Spurr's lack of attention
to two excellent recent studies of Joyce and Jewishness, John McCourt's
<i>The Years of Bloom: James Joyce in Trieste, 1904-1920</i>  and
Marilyn Reizbaum's <i>James Joyce's Judaic Other</i> . Both books
read Bloom's characterization as "the new womanly man" via the sexual
politics of contemporary anti-Semitism, which, following Otto Weininger's
notorious <i>Sex and Character ,</i> insisted upon the effeminacy
of the Jewish male. Neither are cited by Spurr, which might explain
why he reads the often-cited "Cyclops" innuendo "I wonder did he ever
put it out of sight?" not as an anti-Semitic allusion to impotence and
effeminacy, but instead as a stereotype of the Jewish male as oversexed
. <i>Joyce and the Scene of Modernity</i> is, however, engagingly
and fluently written, doing much to make contemporary critical theory
accessible to a wider readership.

1 Introduction
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Georg Klaus (1912-1974), a philosopher and cybernetician from East
Germany, is not a re whose scientific legacy is celebrated today. He
directed the Institute of Philosophy of the East Germany Academy of
Sciences, worked on developing a Marxist semiotics and cybernetics,
influenced East German economic reform in the 1960s, and supported the
development of a microelectronics industry, the only one to develop
significantly in the eastern bloc outside the Soviet Union.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
This is an impressive list of achievements, especially when one considers
the five years from 1933 to 1939 he spent as a political prisoner, two
of them in the Dachau death camp, for organizing Communist resistance
in upper Bavaria, his compulsory Wehrmacht service on the Eastern Front,
and, multiply wounded, his internment as a prisoner of war in Belgium.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
But they remain negligible achievements in the sense that the entire
social legacy of the German Democratic Republic remains negligible after
the cold war. The GDR failed on certain persuasive scales of modernity:
it did not create a state based on popular legitimation, it did not
accumulate the material wealth to challenge the liberal industrial
model of development in the West, and it did not set new standards for

<b></b>

the quality of life. Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen caution that "When
standards are chosen to assess the quality of life of people in different
parts of the world one has to ask whose views as to the criteria should
be decisive. Should we . . . look to the local traditions of the country. . . or should we, instead, seek some more universal account of good
human living . . . ?"
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Regarded locally or universally, the GDR offers little by way of new
standards, hence the nearly unanimous judgment on its failure, and the
oblivion to which someone like Georg Klaus is assigned.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
I want to give the GDR a closer look, however, and understand it not as
establishing new criteria, but as demonstrating something important about
the limits of the criteria of modernity that decided (on) the outcome
of the cold war and now seem so self-evident. These are such familiar
criteria as openness, pluralism, experimentalism and incrementalism,
the same criteria warily celebrated by Max Weber as constitutive of the
disenchanted modern world view and emphatically celebrated by Karl Popper
as the bulwark of the open society.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
In particular, the GDR helps us to see that the criteria that were
efficient causes in determining the cold war outcome have to be subtly
distinguished from the criteria by which that outcome was subsequently
judged as valid or just, and that those latter criteria cannot comprehend
and supercede the distinctions relevant to the former.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Whether or not the GDR's standards for building and assessing a modern
quality of life fit Nussbaum and Sen's view of universality, they were
on the face of it congruent with the standards of the West&#8212;what
was different was the social complex whose function was to maximize
over those recognizable standards. The qualitative rupture that bisected
cold war modernity into first and second worlds took place at the level
of operative totality that I call, in reference to the cybernetic and
systems theoretical traditions, "the system." The challenge that GDR
modernity posed&#8212;and as a historical legacy still poses&#8212;is
not the challenge of alternate criteria per se, but of understanding
how roughly the same criteria could refer to two distinct systems of
modernity and to the qualitative difference between those systems.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
In a manner suggestive for the way I am addressing the specific problem
here, Walter Benjamin once asked whether, after translating from one
language into another, a translator could ever hope to find a third
language in which the difference between the two translations could
itself be translated.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Likewise, the res I am looking at, Georg Klaus, and the most
analytically imaginative of East German creative writers, Franz
F&uuml;hmann (1922-1984), are not concerned with the empirically achieved
and measurable quality of daily life in East Germany, but the possibility
of apprehending an underlying qualitative difference between their system
and that of the West, where their system res for them as both present
actuality (<i>energeia</i>) and future potential (<i>dynamis</i>).
<p>
The problem of whether standards can ever do justice to qualitative
difference, one of the most characteristic intellectual challenges in
a centrally planned socialist culture, first emerges in the simple and
powerful formulation of Plato's <i>Protagoras</i>.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Inquiring into the possibility of living a consistent, holistic
good life&#8212;a well-ordered life, where well-ordering implies the
commensurable ranking and coordination of priorities&#8212;Socrates
describes the paradox of <i>akrasia</i>: if I am offered a choice between

<b></b>

two goods, where one is apparently greater than the other, would I not
always choose the greater good?
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Yet one can imagine cases where I might choose, say, one glass of wine
over another more ample one, because I like the way it reflects the
light. Plato resolves the paradox by explaining my choice as submission
to weakness, or <i>akrasia</i>, because the light, an extrinsic,
incommensurable quality, has distracted me from ranking my priorities
with respect to a disciplined discernment of the greater and lesser good
of comparable values. A science of measurement (<i>metretike techne</i>)
would allow people to make reasonable, far-sighted choices consistently
in their own and society's best interests by bringing all possible
choices into relation with each other on a common yardstick and thus
allowing for a rational ethical decision.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
One socialist version of this classical problem might be apparent. In
a state organized around a planned economy, a science of measurement
by which individual desires are rationally and ethically coordinated
would surely give the planners and their economy an edge over the
non-scientifically organized capitalist competition. The version of the
problem that concerns us here, however, is more existential. If there
is a commensurability of values across modernity, in East as in West,
socialism as in capitalism, is there room for a qualitative difference
between the two systems, and how would one recognize or describe that
quality in the standardized terms of commensurability? If there is no
common yardstick supplied by modernity, then are there rational means
for each system to establish its own qualitatively unique measure? And,
finally, if each system somehow fosters its own valid measure, is there
ever any reasonable way to choose among them, or are disjunctions between
systems presentable only in terms of sovereignty and force?
<p>
The thesis I propose is that a modernity other than that embodied
by the West is possible, one whose values set a reasonable standard
for its own self-description, but which at the systemic level is
separated by incommensurate elements from the familiar modernity
that serves as the proving ground for our common sense decisions
today. The emphasis on distinct modernities is important here, because
it suggests that a consensus around rational, open, experimental,
i.e., modern, categories is not enough to ensure peaceful transitions
between systems and rational communication about rival values. Rather,
material or qualitative differences will persist as dynamic disequilibria
that always threaten force, without necessarily entailing its violent
application. To demonstrate this thesis I will look at the once parallel,
now <i>ex</i>-modernity of socialism as it was conceived and questioned
by Klaus and F&uuml;hmann in the GDR of the 1960s and early 1970s. This
late modernity did not succeed in setting new criteria by which it
could operate as a system with autarchy, complexity and the potential
to reproduce itself and its own way of seeing and parsing the world. But
to establish my thesis I am content to suggest that socialism's culture,
haunted by the insufficiency of its difference from the West, momentarily
attested to the non-uniqueness of modernity by raising, in a rational
idiom, deep problems about organizing society that are compelling,
but largely invisible, to our own. Furthermore, since the end of the
cold war and the demise of the eastern bloc, the issue of qualitative
discontinuities between systems has refused to disappear in a liberal
narrative of the end of history and

<b></b>

perpetual peace.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
As the problem of qualitative difference has reemerged in social
relations, discourses of rational commensurability&#8212;concerning,
for example, technology-driven globalization, representative democracy
or international law&#8212;have been supplemented by those of sovereignty
and force.
<p>
The non-uniqueness of modernity is a fundamental paradox for a
technical-rational thought, hence the haunting pain of socialism's
double vision of itself in its difference from the West. For modernity,
if it is equal to its own description as open and experimental, is
a superlative of social evolution, and the superlative is always a
definite singular. According to Popper, the cold war's most eminent
theoretician of science and society, modernity's openness is epitomized
by its restless falsification of all its provisional truth claims,
leaving only the best standing.
<p>
Modernity in the rational, progressivist account drops what fails
and selects what succeeds, describing the latest and best we have: the
optimum, if not the <i>optimum optimorum</i>, for the world. If socialism
was also a rational modernity, then it was somehow once contemporaneous
with the present singular modernity from which we survey our globe today;
it was, then, also once a superlative of time and space, the latest and
the most forward. Not an "insimultaneity of time" in Ernst Bloch's famous
formulation for the imbrication of old and new worlds, but precisely a
"simultaneity," simultaneous and sharply distinct.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
It then bears asking how a position&#8212;an x, y, z at time
<i>t</i>&#8212;that claims for itself the singularity of the most
advanced and fitting could have been shared by an x', y', z' at time
<i>t</i>' that makes the same legitimating claim?
<p>
Lest I be taken as appealing to too narrow and rationalist a definition
of modernity in defining its singular, progressive path, even so forceful
a critic of logical positivism and scientific reductionism as Edmund
Husserl argued that "to be human at all is essentially to be a human
being in a socially and generatively united civilization; and if man
is a rational being, it is only insofar as his whole civilization is a
rational civilization . . . ." European modernity must bear within it,
according to Husserl, "an absolute idea, rather than being merely an
empirical anthropological type like 'China' or 'India,'" or, I might add,
like the East or West bloc.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Can two or more proper modernities then be thinkable, coordinated within
by the same rational values, but separated from each other by a gap
that cannot be described, let alone forded, in accordance with those
values? Are there questions that socialism&#8212;that is, modernity
<i>prime</i>&#8212;asks of itself that are as universal as they are
untranslatable into the circumstances, if not the idiom, of our most
contemporaneous present? Can this briefly multiplied modernity&#8212;the
existential possibility of a radically different way of answering our
same urgent questions&#8212;ever be resolved back into a single immanent
process, into a single open community of reason and transparency, or does
modernity prime always haunt our progress as an invisible road not taken?

2 Cybernetic mathematization and qualitative leaps
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In 1961 at a crucial turning point for an industrial world already divided
into two hostile cold war blocs, East German Party chief Walter Ulbricht
ordered the erection

<b></b>

of the Berlin Wall. With this sharp demarcation of East and West German
sovereignty, Ulbricht's Politb&uuml;ro felt that East Germany at last
had the breathing room it needed to build socialism, and proceeded to
encourage a reformist spirit to experiment with organizations capable
of maximizing the GDR's potential for innovation.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
In 1963 the Council of Ministers announced "Guidelines for the
New Economic System of Planning and Managing the People's Economy"
(NES). Over the next seven years, until Ulbricht was deposed by Erich
Honecker in 1971, the state repeated that "the fundamental task that
our Party, the GDR working class, and its allied classes must solve is
mastering the socialist economy and the scientific-technical revolution."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Associated with this revolution was not just the development of new
engineering cadre, technological processes and industrial machinery,
but the scientific organization of production, exchange, administration,
education and politics in a socialist society.
<p>
This task of coordinating society on a new basis ultimately fell to the
emerging information science of cybernetics to solve.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
The use of cybernetics for this purpose is not obvious, because
cybernetics&#8212;a science first developed in the 40s and 50s in the
U.S. by Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann&#8212;implied to many critics
in the socialist world an abandonment of the Marxist vision of a practice
based in the experience of class struggle in favor of "system-neutral,"
"value-free" technocratic reason.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The rivalry between technical and political rationality for preeminence
in shaping socialist society was bitter. The eventual acceptance of
cybernetics by the Party hierarchy in the mid-1960s meant that social
subsystems would in principle be left to find their own efficient means
of developing and coordinating themselves, and would not rely on steering
mechanisms based outside the feedback loops of system optimization;
would not, that is, rely on ideologically governed Party decisions,
but on self-generated information.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
The buzz words for ascendant cyberneticians were "self organization,"
"self reproduction," "automatic steering," "automatic coordination," and
"goal orientation"&#8212;not exactly comforting words to ideologically
oriented functionaries.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
In the entry for "goal orientation" ["Zielstrebigkeit"] in the 1969
<i>Dictionary of Cybernetics</i>, Georg Klaus, then the director of
the Institute for Philosophy at the Academy of Sciences, notes that
"if we could observe just the effect of disruptions and the oscillation
of system values around the target state (goal), it would be impossible
to decide whether the coordination mechanism were a mechanical element
or whether its functions were being exercised by a human-being."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
This definition refers to Alan Turing's pioneering essays on artificial
intelligence in which a machine has the capacity not only to reproduce
itself, but to evolve to a higher level.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Klaus elaborates the definition by contrast to the Aristotelian
teleological doctrine that he sees cybernetics as superceding,
holding that a dynamic system is capable of realizing a potential
(<i>dynamis</i>) not observed, measured or caused by its current
state (<i>entelecheia</i>, <i>energeia</i>), but constructed solely
through the reciprocal causality of system and environment (see:
"Wechselwirkung"). With the Berlin Wall buffering it from overwhelming
disruption by a hostile environment, Klaus and his allies in the
Politb&uuml;ro hoped that the cybernetic "black box" of the New Economic
System would not only run smoothly, but evolve intelligently toward an
interactive goal of ever more simply organized complexity,

<b></b>

GDR subsystems regulating themselves according to their adaptive dynamics
(see: "selbstt&auml;tige Regelung"). As the entry on "Trial and Error"
notes: "many organic cybernetic systems have failed because they did
not have time to reach an adaptation."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Cement Wall and cybernetic reform promised socialism that adaptive time.
<p>
Alas, the Wall did not do the trick for the New Economy. Though it
seemed to protect it from "external dialectical contradictions," it
could not save it from its own "internal dialectical contradictions,"
where "oscillations become ever stronger, eventually leading the system
beyond its stability boundaries until its quality is destroyed," as
Klaus' <i>Dictionary</i> cybernetically reformulates the Marxist notion
of dialectical contradiction.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The contradiction that a system whose measure was meant to be the
non-alienated species being of humanity should be regulated by a
mechanism that was indifferently human or machine was too much for a
Marxist party to adapt to: contradictions on that scale were best left
for the West to choke on. So, with the abandonment of the New Economic
System in 1971, "the non-political coordination of individual economic
and social interests fell in favor of exclusively political-ideological
steering," effectively terminating socialism's&#8212;I cite the entry
for "self organization"&#8212;"capacity . . . to improve its structure
either to attain greater stability or to defend its internal milieu
better and more purposefully against environmental disruptions or
inner depreciation."

<p>
In order to clarify how the difficulties raised by the New Economic System
relate to the problems of rational measurement and qualitative difference
in modernity, I want to consider more closely a series of paradoxes that
emerged in Klaus' publicity work on behalf of cybernetics. I start with
Klaus' 1960 article in the Communist Party's national press organ<i>Neues
Deutschland</i>, in which he tentatively offers a cybernetic world
view to a socialist public while showing appropriate deference to the
views of official materialist philosophy. Then I look at a confident
interview in <i>Einheit</i>, the theoretical organ of the Party Central
Committee, given in 1967 when the New Economic System enjoyed strong
official support. I end with Klaus' embattled defense of cybernetics in
1970 when the conservative handwriting on the wall was already legible,
shortly before Ulbricht's, and the New Economics System's, defeat. The
paradoxes encountered at these moments describe fundamental challenges
socialism poses to itself that are simultaneously unanswered challenges to
our modernity. Though the systemic antinomies of socialism are radically
different than those generated by the liberal market system, the value
scale in which they are addressed is familiar: modernity calibrated
in the rational units of equality, freedom and prosperity. Our inquiry
into Klaus' predicament will help us to see the deep discrepancies these
values are unable either to apprehend or to ignore.
<p>
In his 1960 <i>Neues Deutschland</i> article "Control Circuits and
Organisms" Klaus reasons more ideologically than scientifically in
popularizing cybernetics, which was still being attacked in many circles
as a bourgeois pseudoscience and only just beginning to find official
patronage.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Describing the roots of cybernetic theory in engineering technology,
he goes on to explain how the technical regularities of cybernetics
effectively apply to the organic world, elaborating the importance of
human-like computing and

<b></b>

feedback mechanisms for organizing complex systems. "It is characteristic
of cybernetics that it subjects to quantitative observation many process
that were assumed to be only qualitatively comprehensible."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Such technological optimism was possible in what was, after all, the
dawning computer-enabled space age and the age of industrial automation,
and Klaus had only to point to the success of the Soviet Sputnik to find
confirmation for his hopes. The ideological task of the article, however,
was not simply to commend cybernetics' capabilities for integrating
technology and human society, but more subtly, to not <i>over</i>praise
cybernetics lest it be seen as a pretender to dialectical materialism's
role as the truly human arbiter of the sciences. Throughout the
article he cautions against overextending analogies between machines
and human intelligence. The idea that self-regulating machines could
replace government plans might easily have been seen as sacrificing the
very <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for a non-market economy, namely, that
human priorities, self-consciously deliberated, assume control over the
hitherto blind mechanisms of economics. Or, to put the stakes in terms
familiar in Western debates, the risk was that cybernetics might be taken
as a proposal for allowing the quantitative "system-world" to dominate
over the qualitative "life-world." Thus, Klaus aims tactically to limit
the capabilities that one might ascribe to smart machines: while it must
be recognized that in some sense the new robots can think like humans,
they nonetheless "cannot think <i>dialectically</i>," as he concedes.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
They can thus serve, but, for the time being at least, not replace human
dialectical materialism. Klaus' argument limits the use of cybernetics to
the pragmatic goal of most efficiently realizing the party's politically
determined aims.
<p>
Yet there is a deep implication to Klaus' argument. What is it
about dialectical thought that is not matched by cybernetic feedback
circuits? The dialectic of quality and quantity, significantly, begins
Hegel's <i>Logic</i>.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Being, according to Hegel, begins as quality given to the senses without
mediation. It assumes its first mediation as a specific quantity of what
is apprehended. Quantity, however, always threatens to negate Being as
purely external to it. Hegel writes: "Number is a thought, but thought
in its complete self-externalization. Because it is a thought, it does
not belong to perception."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Only in a dialectical third term&#8212;measure&#8212;do qualitative
perception and quantitative apprehension overcome their opposition.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Measure, where quality and quantity are in one is thus the completion of
Being. Being, as we first apprehend it, is something utterly abstract
and characterless; but it is the very essence of Being to characterize
itself, and its complete characterization is reached in Measure. Measure,
like the other stages of Being, may serve as a definition of the Absolute:
God, it has been said, is the Measure of all things.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
By conceding dialectics to humans, in this case, to the Communist Party,
Klaus suggests that cybernetics, while it is driven by information,
quantification and coordination, still needs to seek its valid measure
outside itself. That measure is given by the Party; a society organized on
socialist party principles, therefore, has no reason to fear cybernetic
technocracy. The crucial question left hanging, however, is exactly how
the Party is to find modernity's truly universal measure, the synthesis
of what is qualitatively

<b></b>

new about socialism and what is quantitatively commensurate across its
various social tasks; for if Hegel's Absolute is too mystical a yardstick
for the Party's materialism, then the question of where the Party can
ground a universal, socialist measure, which is also technically precise
in the most modern sense, is unanswered.
<p>
By the time of his 1967 <i>Einheit</i> interview, Klaus is ready to set
a more ambitious agenda for cybernetics. He emphasizes the urgency, and
the opportunity, of establishing what he calls "a new style of thought. . . corresponding to the time and the concrete requirements of the
plan-based application of modern sciences, especially mathematics."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
After touching on the importance of developing a "Marxist semiotics"
in order to make socialist ideas "maximally effective," Klaus turns
to cybernetics as the key to realizing Marx's eleventh thesis on
Feuerbach. "In that we maximally scientifically shape the activity
of human beings, we fill the imperative Marx set out in his famous
Feuerbach theses: the philosophers have only variously interpreted the
world, the point however is to change it."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
With all the maximization involved in Klaus' rhetoric, it seems that
technical reason is winning the upper hand over dialectical reason,
an appearance confirmed by Klaus' recasting of Marx's thesis in
terms that sound suspiciously technocratic. Here, Husserl's famous
critique in <i>The Crisis of European Sciences</i> of the reduction
of the life-world to the terms of the system-world illuminates the
problem Klaus is heading toward. "The material plena&#8212;the
'specific' sense-qualities&#8212;which concretely fill out the
spatio-temporal shape-aspects of the world of bodies <i>cannot</i>,
in their own gradation, be directly treated as are [ideal geometric]
shapes themselves. Nevertheless, these qualities, and everything that
makes up the concreteness of the sensibly intuited world, must count
as manifestations of an 'objective' world."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Contrary to Hegel, Husserl believes that the progressive subordination
of the world to a Platonic "metretike techne," a science of measurement,
leads not to overcoming the opposition between quality and quantity,
but to the effacement of qualitative experience in the name of a
spurious objectivity.
<p>
Klaus, however, now serving as the GDR's philosopher-in-chief, confidently
reclaims socialism's proper measure from the all-too-human Party for the
mathematized world of cybernetics. "The relationship between quantity
and quality is described exactly by mathematics and logic," according
to the <i>Dictionary</i>.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Thus, Klaus observes to his interviewer that "in the complex intersection
of nested cybernetic systems" which make up the emerging socialist
world, only cybernetic theory truly addresses "the unity of laws of
socialist development."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Such an assertion of cybernetic sovereignty can be followed by the
interviewer only with an awed question about cybernetics' insight into
"the essence of socialism's social laws."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Klaus answers by describing a once insurmountable philosophical paradox
that socialist cybernetics now dissolves. On the one hand, the individual
human is the subject of objective laws; in a modern society, the laws
of information, coordination and control. On the other hand, the free
individual creatively participates in shaping these laws.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
For Klaus, cybernetics is able to dissolve the ancient paradox and
simultaneously illuminate the essence of socialism's social laws by
recasting the dialectic of necessity and freedom in game theoretical
terms. At socialism's core, then, is a resourceful game in which each
player follows a five-year

<b></b>

plan and at the same time creatively shapes the plan in anticipation of
the other players' decisions. For him, no high-spirited game could be
more different from capitalism's hostile, chaotic, and counter-productive
competition, whose rules, precisely because they are unplanned, are the
equivalent of natural laws to which the individual is merely subject.
<p>
The resolved paradox of necessity and freedom gives way, however, to
another paradox, that of continuity and discontinuity.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
On the one hand, cybernetics is a "more exact and modern mode of
thought," (<i>EDHS</i>, 165) and Klaus everywhere emphasizes its
precision. Its goal is to mathematize social processes, as the ideal form
of quantification, so as to control them more exactly, and, ultimately,
to coordinate them as a single non-self-contradictory process, namely,
as socialism, with humanity at its base. As we have seen, Klaus is
quite willing now to suggest that dialectics can be mathematized;
that the organic-robotic split of the 1960 <i>Neues Deutschland</i>
article no longer applies. "Mathematics," he now believes, "can well
grasp and represent the essence of things, the quality of things."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
On the other hand, the very precision and mathematical exhaustiveness
of cybernetic control is designed to produce a discontinuous
leap&#8212;"eine sprunghafte Steigerung"&#8212;in human potential.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
That is, the intensification of quantification in each aspect of life,
plus the homogenization of measurement across subsystems, leads not to
mechanistic stasis, but on the contrary to a discontinuous release of
potential that is essentially qualitative and, as such, unquantifiable
("transformation of quantitative change into qualitative").
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
This problem of exactly how, when and where a qualitative leap occurs
becomes a central theme of socialist self-observation, especially in
its literary culture. It also has another paradoxical dimension in that
it appears that the transition from one state to the next involves an
irrational flash somewhat like a religious conversion. Such apparent
leaps between continuous systems are as unacceptable to dialectical
materialists as they are to rational realists like Popper and Imre
Lakatos. Popper admits "that an intellectual revolution often looks
like a religious conversion." Yet it would be "simply false to say
that the transition from Newton's theory of gravity to Einstein's is
an irrational leap and that the two are not rationally comparable."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
The transition of an entire social system to a new qualitative level
appears even more mysterious than the transition across intellectual
programs.
<p>
As if these aporias of cybernetic socialism were not enough, as the New
Economic System comes under increasing ideological pressure shortly before
the removal of Ulbricht, Klaus finds himself having to defend cybernetics
from two related charges&#8212;that it promotes value-neutral social
science, and that it implies in its neutrality that system optimization
is tantamount to system convergence; in other words, that cybernetics,
as opposed to Marxism, is not partisan in its application, but constructs
a unitary, technocratic modernity. In the 1970 <i>Einheit</i> article,
Klaus responds to these accusations in two ways, one substantive and
one stylistic. Cybernetics does not efface differences between socialism
and capitalism, he argues, because of "the opposition of their goals,"
and more importantly, because of "the way in which the elements and
individual laws of cybernetics are applied to reach the goal."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Cybernetics, he claims, only maximizes systemic potential over a certain
quality of relationships and values.

<b></b>

"Capitalism, for example, forms a social system with a corresponding
class content, class ideology, etc. Its subsystems by no means function
to promote an optimization of the whole system. In the socialist system,
by contrast, the human stands in the middle point and the development
of each subsystem always proceeds with reference to the whole."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
The paradox here is that for all of cybernetics' precision and
mathematical abstraction, there is still at its core a qualitative value,
a subjective <i>qualia</i> or an Aristotelian <i>entelecheia</i>, that
gives the absolute measure of its coordinated functions: namely, the
human. Not God, but as Protagoras claimed, "<i>man</i> is the measure
of all things."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Capitalism, for Klaus, as much as it strives for efficiency and
optimality is merely maximizing profits, not people. Cybernetics is now
conceived as a useful instrument, applied to systems that themselves
are not spontaneously generated (autopoietic) organizations, but
represent and maximize certain incommensurable realities. The distinct
identity of each system derives from the qualitative difference of its
underlying value-giver: and this qualitative discontinuity vouches for
the partisan incommensurability of capitalist and communist systems,
even as they share the project of measurable optimization.
<p>
As humanistic as Klaus' sentiment is here, he knows his New Economic
System is under threat, and responds with a correspondingly militant
rhetoric, writing that cybernetics is "a weapon in the hands of the
victorious revolutionary working class and its allies . . . a means for
developing its offensive in the struggle against imperialism."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Cybernetics and its scientific values are transformed in the crisis of
the New Economic System into a weapon of metaphorical violence. They are
offered allegorically as a way to carry on class war by other means,
means appropriate to an enlightened social formation: by virtue of
superior human potential. This potential, however, remains crucially
unquantifiable and revolutionary: a discontinuous leap. Precisely
cybernetics, which coordinates, measures, mathematizes, cannot articulate
the discontinuity of the human quality whose liberation is its reason for
being: except, that is, in this metaphorical violence. Of the paradoxical
inability of a new paradigm&#8212;or, in this case, an entire new social
formation&#8212;to ground its values in its own commensurable terms,
Thomas Kuhn writes that "in a debate over choice of theory, neither
party has access to an argument which resembles a proof in logic or
formal mathematics . . . their recourse is to persuasion as prelude to
the possibility of proof."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
The violence of Klaus' otherwise so measured rhetoric exemplifies
a switch from a realm of syllogistic reason within a system to a
realm between systems, where values can only confront each other
with persuasive force, what Plato called rhetorical <i>peithos</i>
in contrast to the <i>episteme</i> of science that relies only on the
gentle coercion of the better argument.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
For rhetoric serves its end where there is no common standard of
validity, and according to Plato, "when you call things fair, such as
bodies and colors and res and sounds and institutions, you must do
so surely with reference to some standard."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<p>
Klaus' advocacy for cybernetics, as it is pushed up against the wall,
hints at the uncanny double reference in socialism's self reference,
a doubling that haunts the otherwise familiar values of socialism's
pragmatic rationality. Because the vocabularies of modern scientific
rationality are modest in their ontological commitment to the measurable
evidence of daily life, the chasm of <i>im</i>measurable violence that
separated

<b></b>

the socialist and non-socialist worlds remained perforce inarticulate in
the idiom of daily trial and error. Socialism's insecure culture, however,
unlike that of the confident, even solipsistic West, characteristically
doubted its underlying structural integrity&#8212;its <i>differentia
specifica</i>&#8212;just seriously enough to throw into question
whether or not it was really&#8212;qualitatively, quantitatively and
dialectically&#8212;distinct from capitalism. It needed to pose to itself
the question of difference and its trepidation and vehemence cast into
deep relief the ghostly menace of the imponderable abyss between worlds.
<p>
If Klaus' desperate apology takes on a touch of the comic in its
grandiloquence, our subsequent reading of a comic story by Franz
F&uuml;hmann is rather more eerie. Where Klaus' technophilia presents a
red reflection of our blue-blooded modernity with deadpan literalness,
F&uuml;hmann's fiction recognizes the aporias, the undecidability that his
society has opened in modernity without being able to close again. His
story does not so much mirror similar genre pieces in the West with
symmetrical values, but, because socialism never secured itself as
an autarkic alternative, its literature reflects, as scarcely another
does, the intensity of a system whose simultaneously real and impossible
difference from modernity causes the violence of sovereignty to turn in
on itself.

3 Suddenly, F&uuml;hmann's Heap
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
"The Heap", like many F&uuml;hmann stories, seems remote from GDR politics
and Cold War conflict.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
Its theme is the classical Greek paradox of the <i>sorites</i>: if
an element of a heap&#8212;say, a grain of wheat&#8212;is a discrete
quantity, then the gradual addition of one discrete element to another
discrete element can only add up to a discrete quantity and never to a
heap. In terms of mathematical induction: since two are few, and three
are few also, and since for any number n that are few, n+1 are few also;
then, a thousand are few as surely as are two. The ancient physician
Galen, accordingly, concluded "there must not be such a thing in the
world as a heap of grain, a mass or satiety, neither a mountain nor
strong love, nor a row, nor strong wind, nor city nor anything else
which is known from its name and idea to have a measure of extent or
multitude, such as the wave, the open sea, a flock of sheep and herd
of cattle, the nation and the crowd."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Yet socialism&#8212;F&uuml;hmann's historical reality&#8212;is
existentially predicated on the possibility of a qualitative distinction
in modernity, a class consciousness, a species being, a secular
redemption in human life. How then do the relentless quantities of
daily perceptions precipitate suddenly into a socialist quality?

<b></b>

<p>
"The Heap" examines this classical problem in the quintessentially
modern setting of a laboratory in the improbable year 3456. The
Philosopher-in-Chief is asked unexpectedly whether the "Truly Liberated
Society" of 3456 has solved the unsolved problems of the ancients, and,
caught off guard, affirms they have been answered fully. He subsequently
commissions an underling named Janno with producing one of the purported
solutions, namely, that for the sorites. The following narrative takes the
form of a brief, escalating series of conflicts in Janno's lab. One day,
Janno's colleague Jirro comes to visit the lab where Janno is taking
snapshots of screws he is dropping one by one into a basin in hopes
of catching the precise moment when their number becomes a heap. The
preposterously literal experiment ignites a conflict between the obsessed
Janno and his tactically-minded colleague Jirro. When a siren summons
the institute members to the parade grounds for a routine inspection,
the two colleagues' methodological conflict promptly escalates into a
social conflict: the terms, to speak with the philosophy of science,
switch from Karl Popper's doctrine of methodological individualism to
Thomas Kuhn's model of social constructivism.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Bound by his vision of a principled solution to the sorites, Janno
refuses to conform to ritual procedure, much to the horror of his
expedient colleague who has reconciled himself to the reigning
paradigm. Eventually, scientific and police authorities converge
simultaneously on Janno's lab, where the two colleagues remain
struggling over quantity and quality, principle and expediency. The
ensuing confusion, anticlimactically, supplies no clear resolution to the
sorites. On the contrary, confusion, complexity and cross-purposes are
the dubious conditions under which quantity alchemizes into quality. The
resolution comes in spite of itself: the contending parties at the
institute are heaped together in Janno's messy lab by circumstances
beyond their control.
<p>
If this confusion is a disappointing answer to the sorites, a closer look
at F&uuml;hmann's story brings more satisfaction than one might expect
from such murky proceedings. "The Heap" translates Klaus' cybernetic
paradoxes from logic into literature, a cognate medium for F&uuml;hmann,
for, as he remarks in his diaries, "the world can be expressed in poetry,
because it can be mathematized."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Thus, the "hypertrophy of feeling" in his science fiction is, as his
preface has it, "the emotional counterpart to thinking a thing logically
through to its end, except that thinking has a different stringency and
objectivity than fearing, dreading, anticipating or repressing. 'Fearing
to the end' aims at catastrophe; 'anticipating to the end' banishes
alternatives; 'repressing to the end' means destruction; 'dreading to the
end' not only conjures ghosts, but makes them omnipotent, omnipresent,
and absolute."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
The ghosts haunting F&uuml;hmann's scientists, I hope to show, arise
from the equally dreaded and anticipated possibility of another system,
uncannily familiar in its modernity, but visible only as a specter in the
sudden rupture of the current system's pragmatic, adaptive, maximizing
functions. Like all such incommensurabilities, this qualitative
interruption escapes both ethical and material calculi; its ambiguous
value is to be sought only in its openness and potential. Let us see
how F&uuml;hmann's scientists develop the implications of a qualitative
turning point in quantitative continuity.
<p>
Seeing the absurd experiment Janno is conducting, his colleague Jirro
asks him who has paid for the film and screws. Janno, aware that his
superiors would hardly be

<b></b>

so financially forthcoming, has paid out of pocket. But Janno's one-time
expense, as Jirro realizes, threatens to become a precedent if word gets
out. "If the administration, as is only to be expected, generalizes
from your bad example and makes every Ph.D. pay research costs out of
pocket, we'd have only Janno to thank" ("TH," 36). Intuitively grasping
how the particular transmutes into the general under the watchful eyes
of power, Jirro sets himself against Janno's idealistic attempt to
isolate the sorites in his basin of screws, determined instead upon two
more materialist goals: preventing Janno's sacrifice from setting an
institutional precedent, and getting a hold of 10 of his screws while
the getting is still good.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Both objectives necessitate escaping detection. Janno, meanwhile, remains
obsessed with capturing on film the moment a quantity of screws becomes
a quality. Detection&#8212;systemic observation&#8212;it seems is the
precise spot where the qualitative transformation matrix comes into
play. Jirro, however, is canny enough to realize that what Janno is
seeking, the pure qualia, is an illusion&#8212;Jirro is a materialist,
not a phenomenologist, and "the thing in itself" holds no attraction
for him.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
He steers Janno back to quantity by asking him crassly "what the solution
is worth to him." A price? Janno stammers. Unperturbed, Jirro names it
himself: "twenty pounds" ("TH," 38).
<p>
Although he coughs up the sum to his friend, Janno's mind is
elsewhere. Not prices, but qualia alone will deliver him from the
infinite plasticity of the social system: a self-subsistent quality,
a kingdom for a quality, and he will burst asunder the relentless
constructivism of numbers, prices, salaries, authorities, and social
systems. So as Jirro, in exchange for his fee, tiresomely reiterates
his constructivist belief that for their purposes only the "Kameraden
Klassiker" (of Marxism-Leninism) can reliably determine a quality,
Janno becomes aware of the wan light filtering through his dirty office
window. After enduring Jirro's vain dialectics a while longer, he has had
enough, "no, . . . we can no longer understand each other, Jirro. It's
as though I've just now made a leap into another existence: that one
suddenly doesn't want to go on as one did in the past, regardless what
happens . . . the problem, Jirro, the pure problem beyond any purpose,
in pure freedom" ("TH," 46). The siren wails, Janno refuses to answer the
hailing system, Jirro panics over losing his money and cut of the screws,
and, without warning, Janno smashes the dirty window, blood pours from
the backs of his hands, the pure blue of sky streams in, as do two columns
of control troops, the Control Commander and the Philosopher-in-Chief.
<p>
As story and experiment draw to a catastrophic end, F&uuml;hmann
seems to side with Jirro that the sorites has no ideal, only a
constructed solution, with quality asserting itself in precisely the
manner Jirro feared, as state sovereignty and panoptic violence. It
is simply a pre-modern relic, the dark underbelly of threatened
rationality. Quality&#8212;which humanists might have been predisposed
to embrace as their essence&#8212;turns out to be a reactionary value,
sheer unlegitimatible power.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
When the Commander and the Philosopher-in-Chief see a political scandal
in the wreckage of Janno's lab&#8212;an uncooperative philosopher,
perhaps one of many, and an "unbelievable waste of productive
capacity"&#8212;they quickly hit upon an inverse function that can
serve as a mutually satisfactory bureaucratic resolution to the problem:
"as great as is the harm

<b></b>

caused by this heap of inner enemies, so infinitesimally small is its
actual number" ("TH," 54). It is an official formulation that Jirro easily
carries over to Janno's private experiment: "a heap&#8212;or more exactly,
the quantity of its quality&#8212;is always exactly what it has to be
in order to count as the appropriate quantity of a heap in the interests
of the Truly Liberated Society" ("TH," 55). Overwhelmed, but determined
to the last to capture on camera a qualia, even such an unpleasant one,
Janno has Jirro snap a picture of the Commander, his control troops, the
Philosopher-in-Chief, and his wayward underlings in this jolly moment of
reconciliation in the classless society. But Janno notices that the heap
is incomplete, the Commander&#8212;naked police force&#8212;has somehow
eluded the photo-image, and in his naivet&eacute;, Janno reaches out
to pull him back into the circle. The troops panic, pistols are drawn
all around. Jirro, meanwhile, sees his chance to sneak past the metal
detector with his cut of ten screws&#8212;for who would notice that
little heap in the midst of such great events?&#8212;and he bolts.
<p>
This is the moment of revelation, and it appears to vindicate the
machinations of individualists and pragmatists such as Jirro. Yet Jirro
falls on the inert side of the dialectic of necessity and free will that
Georg Klaus claimed cybernetics could resolve. "In the case of natural
laws a person is more or less irrelevant," ("EDHS," 170) Klaus comments,
and the same holds true for Jirro's conformism to social law. Janno,
by contrast, rejects interpellation. By literally refusing to respond
to the siren, the "Institutsappell" ("TH," 48), he sets a limit to
social constructivism. In a single moment, he causes a qualitative
transformation of his environment: poetry emerges from the blood, the
shards of glass, the crystalline revelation of a sudden interruption
of mechanical routine. F&uuml;hmann, in a 1971 letter to his editor,
points out the importance to him of the word "sudden." "It is in fact
the basic experience of my time on earth."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
After describing the abrupt interruptions that have characterized
his life&#8212;from Bohemian Catholic school boy, to Nazi SA member,
soldier, prisoner of war, Communist&#8212;he reflects: "Now, one could
say with horror: what a spongy world, in which ruptures are ceaselessly
occurring! I could answer: what a robust world that it can stand it! But
I believe it is true about the ruptures. It is a world of being handed
over and exposed, a world of being objectified. I could say: it's to
escape it, or to first become aware of it, that I write."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>

<p>
While it would seem that "The Heap" only confirms the danger of
qualitative reason and substantive ontology, there is another side of
the story represented by Janno's stubborn refusal to be constructed
by systemic imperatives. In a flash of broken glass, "the human"
briefly exceeds the system's measure, an incommensurate quality
that shatters its machinery of optimization. The flash, however,
illuminates ambiguously. The quality escapes functionalization in
the continuous metrics of one system, but lasts no longer than the
light of intuition. Here we are reminded of Kuhn's retort to Popper
that he never meant the flash of intuition that leads one to transfer
allegiance from one paradigm to another to be understood as an ontological
revelation. That quality seems to transcend one system does not imply
that it is an ontological absolute for all possible systems. Janno's
irreducible qualitativeness exposes his system's optimum as relative
merely to it, not an <i>optimum optimorum</i>, grounded once in for all
in value beyond measure. Yet it likewise supplies no basis for a final
measure or first

<b></b>

substance. In the ruins of Janno's lab, the only certainty is that no
quality exists outside each heap and as the criterion for them all. Far
from despairing that no system subsumes all alternatives, F&uuml;hmann's
modernity, his experimental and gradualist sensibility, draws him to
the sharp point where measure reveals itself as a construction and the
opportunity for recalibration emerges. At that point, and it is a risky
one, quantity tilts past a system's limits, either as violence or as hope,
always as radical discontinuity: "the turning point can only be grasped as
'sudden,'" F&uuml;hmann writes his editor. "That can also be demonstrated
mathematically. There are curves, hyperbola (of the type: y=1/x
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
), for example, where with the least change in the curve, the addition
or subtraction of the smallest imaginable unit, the differential quotient
explodes from positive to negative infinity."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
The question, then, posed by the qualitative, is whether the breach in
the commensurable shall be filled with what Hegel called "the wrong or
negative infinity" or with a positive one that yields to qualitative
transformation.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
And the answer to that question F&uuml;hmann, and the history of
alternatives to liberal capitalist modernity, has left to us.

<p>
F&uuml;hmann puts his readers before a stark choice: an infinite
destructive regression or an infinite asymptotic convergence. In
a sense, however, the two options are not options at all, but the
conditions of systematicity. A dynamic system, as Klaus made clear, can
always be disrupted or protected, correcting itself to converge on a
finite stability or exploding into chaos. F&uuml;hmann, in the battle
of sensibilities between Janno and Jirro, asks whether stability,
equilibrium, order and mediation are the optimum goal ["Sollwert"],
or whether crisis is a worthwhile risk for finding an optimum outside
of the target states of the given system. Thus, Klaus writes in his
1960 <i>Neues Deutschland</i> article that "man is not content just to
maintain the conditions of his environment, he wants rather constantly to
improve them, and not only that, he also strives to ensure the security
and stability of human relationships against chances of every sort."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Precisely this question, whether the goal of science and thus of
humanity is stability or risk, is addressed by Nietzsche in "On Science,"
where his antagonists argue whether they seek Zarathustra to find more
security or insecurity. Zarathustra himself believes that science is
not a refinement of fear in search of security, but a refinement of
courage in search of risk and change.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
F&uuml;hmann's two scientists play out this dialectic, where Janno's
destructive courage finally seems a risk worth taking. The crisis he
induces exposes the sovereignty of his system as a formal constraint
on all its possible states. In the sudden light of crisis, sovereignty
is hypostatized for Janno as a form of control rather than a medium
of self-realization. It is the positive historical form (and hence
practical negation) of any ideal universality.

<b></b>

<p>
Another way to see the force of F&uuml;hmann's story&#8212;and socialist
culture's intensive exploration of alternate forms for a positive
sovereignty that is nonetheless disposed to a universal modernity&#8212;is
to examine the fortunes of sovereignty in several key debates after the
fall of historical socialism. Since the end of the Cold War a series of
transatlantic discussions have shaped the way we talk about sovereignty
and the prospects of universal, boundless systematicity. The first set
of debates, conducted against the background of the 1990-91 Gulf War and
European-American engagements in the former Yugoslavia, turned around a
comparison of national with international institutions for securing global
order. The outcome was an emphasis on the importance of international
institutions. Multilateralists argued that the traditional mechanisms of
state sovereignty&#8212;economic autarky, the military, the friend/foe
distinction, ethnic identification, and religious homogeneity&#8212;were
becoming outmoded in an increasingly globalized world in which order could
be more effectively maintained through a common legal framework. Unlike
state sovereignty, international law appealed to reason, debate, and
limited corrective force, rather than to power, religion, ethnic loyalty,
or national interest. Even Marxist thinkers such as Michael Hardt and
Anthony Negri, apparently so far outside of any popular consensus,
argued that the era of sovereignty and spatio-temporal borders of power
had ended with the end of the socialist second world, gradually being
replaced by unlimited capital mobility and "a single logic of rule."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
After September 11th, however, the tenor of the times switched,
sovereignty becoming the preferred rubric under which policy and opinion
makers conceive the strategic world order.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
It is argued that a strong state, with a credible military force, is
necessary to guarantee not only the security of its citizens, but also
the order of relationships between states and populations in the world.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Although the tenor of the two debates is different, as are the specific
challenges of the world events to which they refer, the two consensus
positions are not as divergent as they might at first seem. In the former
debate, as idealistically as thinkers from John Rawls in the U.S. to
J&uuml;rgen Habermas in Germany argued for the primacy of reason and its
institutionalization in international law, the clear understanding was
that jurisdiction in the world would center on the U.S., as both the most
powerful state and the most influential model for legality, <i>primus
inter pares</i>. Similarly, in the latter debate, today's return to
"the state" does not mean a return to many states, each <i>par inter
pares</i> in a multi-polar world of alliances and spheres of influence,
but a return to a forthright projection of U.S. might. There are
advantages and disadvantages to the emphases of each consensus. If the
first consensus indeed held up the laudable idea of universal justice
as a system for resolving disagreements between states, it had the
drawback of obscuring the factual concentration of legislative, judicial
and police powers in a few states that had by no means repudiated the
sovereign use of force. If the second consensus seems more cynical in
its appeal to a narrow idea of national interest and in the eclipse
of humanitarian ideals in favor of strategic calculations, it has the
merit of removing the ideological camouflage from international actions
that are credibly explicable in categories of national self-interest.

<b></b>

<p>
Although the assertion, in the second consensus, of the rights of
aroused power over those of just procedure is harsher than that which
followed the Gulf War, its way of validating itself shares essential
features with the earlier consensus, especially its articulation
in terms of the humane values that all such strategic thinking is
intended to serve and protect. Whether good laws or smart missiles
secure their viability, the humane values themselves&#8212;openness,
pluralism, gradualism and consumerism; or Max Weber, John Dewey, and Karl
Popper&#8212;remain without credible challengers in the transatlantic
public, defining a good life to which strategists must appeal to win
their positions. Contemporary elites, lofted on a platform of global
markets, democracy, and technology, have learned to do business without
fundamental truth claims and to accommodate a diversity of ideas and
practices. Intellectuals as disparate as Rawls, Richard Rorty, Michael
Walzer, Samuel Huntington, Francis Fukayama, Louis Menand, Nussbaum and
Sen, attest to the ascendancy of reason over identification, pluralism
over totality, skepticism over certainty, reform over rupture.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
In German public letters, <i>Die Zeit</i> editor Josef Joffe fits into
this mainstream as surely as does Berlin Academy of Arts President
Gy&ouml;rgy Konr&aacute;d, and as do Karl-Heinz Bohrer, Henryk Broder,
and Hans Magnus Enzensberger; the quarrelling camps of Habermas and
his late rival Niklas Luhmann are also reconciled here.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>

<p>
These familiar ideas constitute in fact the core of what is generally
regarded as the modern worldview. In his famous 1918 talk "Science
as a Vocation" Weber, as we have seen, gave modernity an influential
formulation as a worldly disenchantment and secular responsibility that
forgo secular salvation.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
After the subsequent century's violent eruptions of nostalgia for (or
messianic anticipation of) the fundamental, the pure, and the total,
Weber's disciplined forfeiture of transcendental satisfactions has been
all-but-decisively vindicated against persistent romantic claims for
fundamental ontologies, against Herder's "Volksgemeinschaften," Fichte's
"geschlossener Handelsstaat" or any number of "Schicksalsgemeinschaften"
["communities of fate"] of both left and right provenance.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Thus, for Habermas, the imposition of a liberal state form on half
of the defeated Third Reich was not an ontological imposition&#8212;a
controlling order in the contingent form of American-style constitutional
sovereignty&#8212;but truly an emancipation of Germany from its
pre-modern particularity.
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
Historically saddled with ponderous appeals to "special German
paths"&#8212;and special Teutonic qualities&#8212;Germany was thenceforth
liberated into a cosmopolitan modernity that is rightly not special
at all, except in the degree to which it is advanced along the path of
universal development.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>

<p>
I want to return to the debates between Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn
to propose looking at the bifurcation of our times differently than
one between an open, universal, and globalizing modernity, on the one
side, and a conventional, qualitative and closed pre-modernity, on the
other. Popper, as we have seen, based his cold war animus on the belief
that Western industrial democracies founded on a modern experimental ethos
were open societies, whereas Marxist states, guided by an unfalsifiable
ideology rather than scientific reason, were terminally closed. This
postulate expresses a faith in rational communication and the possibility
of reasonable adjudication of competing views. "Thus in science, as
distinct from theology, a critical comparison of

<b></b>

the competing theories, of the competing frameworks, is always
possible. . . . In science (and only in science) can we say that we have
made genuine progress: that we know more than we did before."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
As much as Popper based his position on transcendent rationalism while
social theorists like Habermas and Rawls base theirs in an immanent
sociology of undistorted consensus, they all have an optimistic belief
in the ability of rational discussion, rooted in individual development
free from coercion by irrational power, to overcome, through the gradual
give and take of positions, the sharp qualitative differences that
distinguish between categories and systems.
<p>
Kuhn likewise believed that scientific communities were good models for
rational modernity, but he also held that their defining characteristic
was not their openness. They are enclosed by their own paradigms
and beyond these frameworks their conclusions cannot be rationally
adjudicated. Thus, John Watkins characterizes Kuhn's view as maintaining
that "the scientific community [is] an essentially closed society,
intermittently shaken by collective nervous breakdowns followed by
restored mental unison."
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
With this view of Kuhn's position in mind, we can see how the socialist
east might indeed have been a relatively closed ideological system
that <i>precisely for that reason</i> resembled a modern scientific
community. In <i>Closed Worlds: Computers and Politics of Discourse
in Cold War America</i>, Paul N. Edwards uses the phrase 'closed-world
discourse' "to describe the language, technologies, and practices that
together supported the visions of centrally controlled, automated global
power at the heart of American Cold War politics."
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>

<p>
Now, one should emphasize that what is at stake in the discussion
of socialism is not a distinction between two views of the world, but
between two ontological totalities, each systematically organizing their
worlds. In this sense, the view that Klaus and F&uuml;hmann afford us from
within socialism shows that power, however constructed, internalized, and
decentralized is always necessarily articulated at its borders as a form
of hypostatized sovereignty. Such sovereignty, however, no more implies an
external imposition than the skin of a body implies a constraint upon its
extension. I do not mean to naturalize sovereignty; indeed, the validity
of power and force is continually reassessed in terms of legitimacy,
efficiency, happiness, or any other powerful guiding value&#8212;and the
essence of the political is to contend power's validity. But between
systems, the rational terms of contention necessarily confront the
forceful perimeters of sovereignty. Systematicity, as Luhmann has
commented, is unable to see its own exterior and thus the conditions
of its sovereignty. "Observation is any kind of operation that makes a
distinction so as to designate one (but not the other) side. . . . Every
description of society must take place within that society."
<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
Ultimately, both systematicity and sovereignty are contingent, and
contingent precisely upon each other as their own preconditions and
limits. What F&uuml;hmann's story indicates is that the suddenness and
illumination of crisis is a moment, not necessarily of apocalypse, but of
risk. This choice between systems can only be rationally reconstructed
in retrospect on a quasi-juridical model in which specific, given
facts and postulates are assessed. It cannot be made prospectively on
apodictic grounds. Prospectively, the best one can do is be attentive
to the ontological construction of quality, or, what amounts to the same

<b></b>

thing, circumspectly commitment oneself at one moment or another, one
place or another, to a specific difference. To exhibit this prospective
openness, this reception to the temporality of suddenness, rupture and
change, is not nihilistically to repudiate the retrospective attitude
of judgment. Nor is it to devote oneself to a messianic, and pre-modern,
redemption. For as firm as open-ended commitment must be for qualitative
difference to matter, it still must accept that quality and measure are
always immanent to a provisional and closed system of coordination.

This idea of the GDR's failure should be understood as a paradox that the
following article explores. As Imre Lakatos, otherwise very close to Karl
Popper, has pointed out, Popper is inconsistent precisely with respect
to the question of the failure or refutation of Marxism, which leads
Popper to make "such confusing formulations as 'Marxism is irrefutable'
and, at the same time, 'Marxism has been refuted.'" Imre Lakatos,
"Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes,"
in <i>Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge</i>, eds. Imre Lakatos and
Alan Musgrave (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 91-196,
n119. The point might be made more clearly outside of the Popperian
program of falsifiability. In the same volume, Thomas Kuhn ("Logic of
Discovery of Psychology of Research?" 1-23) argues that rival models of
knowledge (paradigms)&#8212;and, more fundamentally, the communities that
support their respective frameworks&#8212;are mutually incomprehensible to
each other. They cannot be tested, and thus cannot fail, in each others'
terms (13, and for Lakatos' characterization, 179). The failure, then,
of the GDR, must be seen, as I suggest below, as a failure of historical
state socialism to establish persuasive criteria for its own effective
and legitimate <i>self</i>-description.

Martha Nussbaum distinguishes four distinct constituent claims in Plato's
ethical science of measurement (<i>metretike techne</i>). Metricity
implies that in a situation of choice there is a common value,
varying only in quantity, to each choice. Singleness implies
there is one metric for all situations of choice. Consequentialism
implies that these comparable values reside in the outcome of the
choice. Maximalization implies that there is a value that (either
in each case, or&#8212;for example happiness or pleasure&#8212;in all
cases) can and should be maximized. Martha Nussbaum, "The Discernment of
Perception: An Aristotelian Conception of Private and Public Rationality,"
<i>Love's Knowledge</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), 56. The
distinction, or, more precisely, the ambiguity that I am emphasizing is
between criteria as universal standards "outside" of the situation being
decided, and criteria that themselves are effective causes of a situation
of choice in the first place and thus cannot be adduced as independent
(third party) standards.

Loren R. Graham makes a similar point about the study of Soviet
science. He points out that precisely because Soviet society was "based
on principles&#8212;economic, social, philosophical&#8212;strikingly
different from those of other industrial nations," those aspects of
it that were similar to Western nations, in particular its science,
reveal a lot about the way science and society relate. He concludes
his overview of the Soviet experience that "we can understand how much
<i>our</i> science and <i>our</i> culture are conditioned by <i>our</i>
society only if we have another society and another culture with which we
can appropriately draw comparisons. The Soviet Union may well have been
one of the last modern alternatives to dominant Western patterns with
which such comparisons of science can be made. In that sense, the study
of Soviet science is also a study of <i>our</i> science." <i>What Have

The debate over the incommensurability of "paradigms" in Kuhn's
work is a more recent, but now classic, locus for the discussion of
incommensurability. "The point-by-point comparison of two successive

consequences of both can be translated without loss or change . . . no
such vocabulary is available. . . . Successive theories are thus, we say,

Here, we can also see how a satire of cybernetic reasoning such as
Christa Wolf's 1970 story "Neue Lebensansichten eines Katers" ["The
New Life and Opinions of a Tomcat"] played a reactionary role against
the N&Ouml;S. Bitterly repressed at the 11th Party Plenum ("Kahlschlag
Plenum"), humanists like Wolf did not recognize that their enemies were
not directly the technocrats then in favor with the Ulbricht regime. They
equated the state with technocratic reasoning, which presumably spurned
humanist values such as quality, and thus when the state struck back with
the qualitative force of Party sovereignty, they had lost their chance for
an alliance with quantity. F&uuml;hmann's story, in contrast to Wolf's,
sees the merits of quantity and the dangers of quality. Christa Wolf,

1 Art Without Air
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Near the beginning of the essay "Pictures" (one of the six lectures that
make up her American speaking tour of 1934-5), Gertrude Stein describes
the formative experience&#8212;at age eight&#8212;when she first sees
a large painting of the battle of Waterloo:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
It was an oil painting a continuous oil painting, one was surrounded by
an oil painting and I who lived continuously out of doors and felt air
and sunshine and things to see felt that this was all different and very
exciting. There it all was the things to see but there was no air it just
was an oil painting. I remember standing on the little platform in the
center and almost consciously knowing that there was no air. There was
no air, there was no feeling of air, it just was an oil painting and it
had a life of its own. . . .
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Dwarfed by this room-sized panorama, Stein compares her feelings
inside the gallery to her other childhood experiences, "continuously
out of doors." She loves fresh air, but the painting thrills her in
a different way&#8212;as an art object with "a life of its own." The
stimulating part of this experience, as she explains it, is not exactly
the objects represented ("the things to see")&#8212;she already knew
all about Napoleon&#8212;what excites her is the representation itself:
"the thing that was exciting me was the oil painting" ("P," 226).
<p>
One way to read her interest in the painting, rather than the things
painted, is as an example of what is usually thought of as the modernist
critique of referentiality. According to this view,

<b></b>

modern works of art and literature attempt to displace the
nineteenth-century naturalistic emphasis on external reality by
problematizing the relation between a representation and the thing
represented. But Stein's focus on air&#8212;its absence in the painting
versus its presence outdoors&#8212;suggests that her actual point is
slightly different. It is not that she is concerned to characterize
the relationship between the painting and the thing painted as
non-referential; what she says instead is that "the relation between
the oil painting and the thing painted was really nobody's business"
("P," 237). Thus she compares the panorama to her experience of an
actual battlefield in Gettysburg not to assess its verisimilitude or lack
thereof but to insist that the "oil painting" is "an entirely different
thing." The point of insisting that there is no air in the oil painting
will be to shift her focus from the relation between an object and its
representation to the relation between an art object (a representation)
and its beholder.
<p>
We can see that her primary interest is not referentiality from her
characterization of paintings as individual faces. Becoming familiar
with oil paintings, she writes, is like the process of becoming "more
and more familiar with faces" ("P," 236). To understand an oil painting
fully is to become intimate with a new person's face: "Faces gradually
tell you something . . . as you grow more and more familiar with any and
all faces and so it is with oil paintings. The result was that in a way
I slowly knew what an oil painting is. . . . " ("P," 236). Whatever
else you might feel about a new face&#8212;and Stein acknowledges
that you may feel surprised or "even shocked" by a new face&#8212;you
cannot dismiss a new face as a copy of another face you already know:
"You cannot refuse a new face. You must accept a face as a face. And so
with an oil painting" ("P," 237). The point here is that Stein is not
interested in discovering resemblances between a painted portrait and an
actual person (a representation and its referent), but in confronting
and accepting a painting as a new person, entirely separate from the
beholder. She comes to know "what an oil painting is," in other words,
when she understands it as the face of an autonomous person with a "life
in and for itself of an oil painting" ("P," 237). A painting for Stein is
not simply another functional object in the gallery (like the platform),
but a self-reliant subject with a place all its own.
<p>
Or consider the unusual, childhood perceptual games she devises in Italian
museums, when she begins&#8212;literally&#8212;"to sleep and dream in
front of oil paintings": "There were very few people in the galleries
in Italy in the summers in those days and there were long benches and
they were red and they were comfortable at least they were to me and the
guardians were indifferent or amiable and I could really lie down and
sleep in front of the pictures" ("P," 231). The activity Stein describes
is when, upon waking, she can momentarily (albeit sleepily) identify
with the paintings as faces "sleeping" in front of her. She perceives
the paintings as "sleeping" because they are perpetually unaware of her.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
The painting is never able to see the viewer, that is, to see Stein
sleeping&#8212;and waking&#8212;on a red bench in an Italian museum. But
the importance of this activity is that her sleep dramatizes the fictive
irrelevance of the beholder to the work of art. By imagining paintings as
faces&#8212;and, by extension, as persons with conscious states like her
own (sometimes sleeping, sometimes waking)&#8212;Stein is also imagining
paintings that are utterly independent of her own consciousness. In other

<b></b>

words, her deep reverie is so complete that she can imagine a painting
as another conscious person, even when she herself is sleeping and not
consciously beholding the painting.
<p>
Clarifying her point, Stein explains that this is not merely about playing
an optical trick on yourself ('convincing' yourself you are in a pastoral
landscape upon awaking): on the contrary, if the painting's status as
representation is effaced the game will fail. Thus, unlike a Tintoretto or
Giotto, a naturalistic Botticelli is a poor painting to sleep in front of
because the illusion (the "thing painted") overpowers the representation
(the "painting"): "I used to walk in the country and then I concluded
that the Botticellis being really so like the flowers in the country
they were not the pictures before which one could sleep, they were to
my feeling, being that they looked so like the flowers in the country,
they were artificial" ("P," 231). Stein is not interested in sleeping
in front of a simulacrum of the flowers&#8212;this is the substance
of her complaint about the "artificial" Botticelli flowers. Instead,
she must sleep in front of a representation that has "a life of its
own"&#8212;the Tintoretto flowers. Each experience underscores her
understanding of painting as representation: "As I say in sleeping and
waking in front of all these pictures I really began to realize that an
oil painting is an oil painting. I was beginning after that to be able
to look with pleasure at any oil painting" ("P," 232).
<p>
We can begin to see why sleeping in front of an oil painting is such
a crucial model for Stein, and why I am arguing that Stein's interest
is not in the work of art in relation to its referent, but in the work
of art in relation to the beholder. When Stein realizes, in the midst
of the panorama, that "there was no feeling of air, it just was an oil
painting and it had a life of its own," she is claiming that the work of
art inhabits a space that is different not only from the space inhabited
by the things the painting represents, but is also different from the
space inhabited by its beholder. Stein captures this idea by claiming
that in the painting, there is no air. Her interest in the difference
between the space of the painting and the space of the beholder explains
what is otherwise very hard to explain; namely, her dramatization of the
beholder in front of the painting as an insistence that the beholder
is asleep. In other words, Stein illustrates a distinction between
two spaces&#8212;the space of the painting versus the space of the
beholder&#8212;as a distinction between two individuated consciousnesses:
the awake person and the sleeping person.
<p>
As idiosyncratic as her preoccupation with air in paintings may seem,
Stein is not the only major modernist to reflect upon the possibility
or impossibility of breathing in painting. In <i>The Childermass</i>
, Wyndham Lewis imagines an art full of air by depicting a painting
his protagonists can walk into. Resembling a chattier and busier version
of a Samuel Beckett play, the novel portrays Pullman and his bumbling
companion Satters as they wander around an otherworldly, yet vaguely
familiar, landscape. In this modernized version of Dante's <i>Divine
Comedy</i>, they are stuck "Outside Heaven" in a purgatory resembling
England between the wars.
<p>
As these two ghosts study their new environment, they eventually notice
a strange landscape where "nothing seems to be moving on its surface"
and everything "is a little faded":
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"What the devil's this?" Pullman's voice is as sober as before it was
all on fire. Satters does not like to say what he sees . . .


<p>
There is a wide view stretching as far as the eye can reach across
flattish country. It is bounded by rain-clouds, they block the
horizon. Thenthere is snow.



<p>
"It's like a picture," Satters suggests, haltingly, afraid the word may
not be right.
<p>
"Exactly!" (<i>TC</i>, 104)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Pullman and Satters have inadvertently stumbled into a huge, nearly
completed, landscape-painting that appears as "flattish country". In
fact, Pullman identifies this painting as the same type that delights
Stein at age eight: "Why we're in a panorama!" (<i>TC</i>, 123). Barely
distinguishable from the broader environment, the painting is so large
that Pullman advises Satters that they had better "go through it" because
walking around it "would take hours" (<i>TC</i>, 106). While in it,
they notice that the leaves on the bushes become progressively smaller,
suggesting that they are walking "into" the illusion of depth: "Look
at that hedge. Do you see its perspective? It's built in a diminishing
perspective! I believe the whole place is meant to be looked at from
behind there, where we have just come from" (<i>TC</i>, 123). This
painting's canvas and frame are entirely invisible to them&#8212;it is
only the paint and the painting that they perceive. Thus, Pullman can
only surmise the appropriate spectator position ("from behind there,
where we have just come from") after he has entered the painting,
traversed its imperceptible frame, and examined the shrinking hedges.
<p>
Nonetheless, there are some palpable differences between their world
and the painting's world. Consider, for example, the initial moment
when they walk "into the picture": "After taking a few steps forward
[Satters] encounters what by contrast is an icy surface of air. He stops,
catches his breath. For a moment the hot wind beats behind him, then he
steps into the temperature of the 'picture' or the 'hallucination.' It is
moist and chilly but windless" (<i>TC</i>, 106). The air in this picture
is startling: Satters "catches his breath," shocked by the difference
in temperature between painting-air and purgatory-air. But despite
being colder, thinner, and windless, the crucial issue here is that the
painting-air is still encountered <i>as air</i>. Painting-air might be
slightly different from purgatory-air, but the air is essentially the
same type: breathable. Satters and Pullman can disregard the invisible
frame of this painting, treating it as a window frame to step through
(although not without some shock), placing them physically in the scene
of representation. Lewis effectively equates the experience of walking
into a place (through a window frame) with the experience of being
<i>absorbed in</i> a representation (through a picture frame).
<p>
At this point, the contrast to Stein could not be more striking. Where
Stein, in front of the painting of Waterloo, imagines that "there was no
air, there was no feeling of air, it just was an oil painting and it had a
life of its own . . . " ("P," 226-7), Lewis imagines a painting so full of
air that his two characters not only describe it in detail, but feel it in
their lungs. Whereas Stein divides the place of a painting and the place
of the beholder, Lewis combines these two spaces into one. Instead of a
painting separated from the spectator's physical world by its airlessness,
the panorama Pullman and Satters encounter <i>is</i> their world, albeit
a slightly different part of their world, where the air

<b></b>

"has a rarity of its own&#8212;it's really as though we were on
the Matterhorn" (<i>TC</i>, 122). Most crucially, Stein invokes the
example of painting to illustrate her commitment to the irrelevance
of the spectator experience to the meaning of the art object. Lewis,
in contrast, emphasizes that these purgatory-paintings need active
spectators&#8212;the physical and mental involvement of Pullman and
Satters is required for the painting to be complete.
<p>
It is not, however, as if Lewis creates this entire episode of Pullman
and Satters strolling into a painting in order to advocate air-filled
painting as a theory of art. In fact, it is exactly the reverse. He
is satirizing those artists and critics who, if they did not exactly
believe that art was full of air, did believe that art was something to
be stepped into and completed by its beholders.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
In Lewis's opinion, this belief was an integral part of a broader
cultural trend (which he termed "time-philosophy") that had become all
too common in modern, post-Impressionist art and literature. When Satters
mumbles that their new landscape is not exactly a picture but "like a
picture"&#8212;and Pullman immediately agrees ("Exactly!")&#8212;Lewis
is taking aim at the vision of the work of art here embodied (<i>TC</i>,
104). In other words, this panorama resembles a painting without actually
being one. Lewis satirizes art that needs its spectators' experience to
be whole, because such art fails to differentiate between a painting of
a panorama and one's experience of a view at the top of the Matterhorn.
<p>
What I am arguing here, that in Stein the phenomenological space of the
beholder is different from the space of the art object, is completely
contraindicated in the critical consensus on Stein (a consensus that
begins with Lewis himself). Instead of producing an art that merges
content and context&#8212;that is, a painting and its beholder's place,
a poem and its reader's point of view&#8212;Stein wants to make everything
about the beholder or reader irrelevant to her art. In the next section,
I show how Stein accomplishes this aim with <i>Tender Buttons</i>
, her exceptional book of avant-garde poems, by removing
punctuation. Although in discussing Lewis's dramatization of Pullman
and Satters intruding into the painting I am describing exactly the
opposite of Stein's theory of art, and although Lewis <i>himself</i>
saw his position as completely opposed to Stein, Lewis was, in fact,
also advocating an art that imagined the beholder as irrelevant. In
the third section, I show how <i>The Childermass</i> is an articulate
dramatization of time-philosophy in painting, and thus an excellent
example of Lewis's aesthetic theory put into novelistic practice.

2 Stein's Intrinsic Quotation Marks
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Stein is primarily interesting to us as a writer, and only secondarily
as an art theorist. What does her position on the ontology of art
objects ("an oil painting is an oil painting") have to do with Stein
as a writer? In part, Stein allies herself with painters throughout her
career as a form of strategic self-advertisement: the popular success of
<i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> (excerpted in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> in 1933) was fueled by Stein's unabashed affiliation with
this Parisian avant-garde of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
But her motives are also strategic in a different sense. Stein aligns

<b></b>

her poetry with Picasso's painting to increase the value of her seemingly
inaccessible writing as an art with meaning. Thus she explains that she
"was expressing the same thing in literature" as Picasso was in painting.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
Most often, literary critics have interpreted this claim as Stein's
support for "literary cubism"&#8212;a jumble of words juxtaposed for
their overall sound or appearance instead of their meaning. Thus Michael
Hoffman interprets Stein's <i>Tender Buttons</i> as "verbal collage," and
Marjorie Perloff reads <i>Susie Asado</i> as matching, "the instability,
indeterminacy, and acoherence of Cubism."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
But I am arguing that Stein does not share Hoffman's and Perloff's view
of Picasso's Cubist painting&#8212;and more pertinently&#8212;that
her work is not "literary cubist" in their sense of an art of
indeterminacy. For one thing, her 1912 portrait of Picasso&#8212;written
in the middle of his Synthetic Cubist (i.e., collage) stage&#8212;focuses
repeatedly on his ability to produce a definite art object with a
precise meaning. Picasso creates "a heavy thing, a solid thing and a
complete thing" which has "a solid meaning, a struggling meaning, a clear
meaning" ("PI," 282). Furthermore, he entrances a coterie of beholders
("they were always following him," ["PI," 284]) with his complete
meanings. Stein champions Picasso's Cubism because, like herself, he
asserts the completeness of the work of art; that is, when the art object
"is completely contained within itself . . . this gives it at once its
complete solidity, its complete imagination, its complete existence."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
She aims to produce a similarly complete, entrancing object&#8212;albeit
a poetic object&#8212;one which could produce that feeling of "no
air" at the Waterloo panorama, and that sensation of waking up in a
gallery and realizing "that an oil painting is an oil painting" ("P,"
232). She wants her poem to be so completely absorbing and meaningful
that <i>where</i> the reader is does not matter: "On one level, she
might simply mean that her writing is absorbing for the reader: It
is nice that nobody writes as they talk and that the printed language
is different from the spoken otherwise you could not lose yourself in
books and of course you do, you completely do. I always do."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
If losing yourself in books sounds a lot like straying into a painting,
Stein's interest in the reader's engrossment is nonetheless undercut
by the logic of her main aesthetic point. It is not the process of
completely losing yourself in books that she is focusing on, but rather
the <i>irrelevance</i> of the response of the reader to the meaning
of the text. In other words, she is describing something much closer
to the fiction of the reader's<i>nonexistence</i>. A poem succeeds as
"a complete thing" by ignoring the reader: "An Audience is pleasant if
you have it, it is flattering and flattering is agreeable always, but if
you have an audience the being an audience is their business, they are
the audience you are the writer, let each attend to their own business."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
To clarify, this is not merely an avant-garde indifference to success,
although at times Stein does indeed display such an indifference.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Instead, Stein is committed to distinguishing the writer's
"business" from the reader's (whose presence is merely "pleasant" and
"flattering"). What the reader does is something she is indifferent to,
or more properly, what the reader does is something that has no relevance
to the meaning of the text. At best, you as a writer can hope that your
"force" is felt, that somebody "will have to realise that you know what
you mean and so they will agree that you mean what you know, what you

<b></b>

know you mean."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
The author's intention to mean must be assumed as an act of faith on the
part of the reader, but whether or not the reader offers such good-faith,
Stein knows what she means when she writes.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
Recall once again her response to the panorama: "there was no feeling
of air, it just was an oil painting and it had a life of its own." The
Waterloo painting disregards the viewer's "feeling of air"&#8212;that is,
it eliminates the relevance of the world outside the painting, the world
of the European museum which the painting is literally part of. Stein
attempts to produce poetry and prose with a similarly "complete existence"
by eliminating punctuation, above all commas. The problem with commas
is that they let "you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a
breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Just as the air you inhale while looking at a painting has nothing to
do with the picture on the wall (because the painting has "a life of
its own" and "no feeling of air"), the air you inhale while reading has
nothing to do with Stein's written texts: "Gertrude Stein said commas
were unnecessary, the sense should be intrinsic and not have to be
explained by commas and otherwise commas were only a sign that one should
pause and take breath but one should know of oneself when one wanted to
pause and take breath ("A," 793). She sees punctuation as an effort to
dictate the literal experience of reading; to focus on the reader would
be to sacrifice the autonomy of the text. In fact, Stein writes that
"the longer, the more complicated the sentence . . . the more I felt the
passionate need of [the words] taking care of themselves by themselves
and not helping them" by adding punctuation ("PAG," 321). Stein extends
this point beyond commas, claiming that <i>all</i> diacritical marks
(question marks, exclamation marks, apostrophes, quotation marks,
etc.) should be eliminated in order to confirm the irrelevance of the
reader ("PAG," 316-21).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
The only mark of punctuation she will finally accept is the period, and
not because the period is of any use to the reader, but because it is
inevitable that a writer sometimes needs to take a break: "physically one
had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again
stop some time then periods had to exist" ("PAG," 318). The crucial
point here is that Stein's use of periods is not a contradiction of
her larger critique of diacritical marks, but rather an example ofher
thorough commitment to the writer's engrossment in her own writing and
of the irrelevance of the reader's body to the meaning of the text. If
periods are a necessary condition for the poet to write&#8212;and thus
<i>must</i> be used&#8212;commas and other punctuation unnecessarily
intrude upon the reader's own "business" and should be avoided.
<p>
Starting with "Objects," the first section of <i>Tender Buttons</i>, Stein
intends some of her words to signify <i>as if</i> they were detached from
the sentence by quotation marks&#8212;yet she leaves out the quotation
marks that would help the reader understand her meaning. "A box" begins,
"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same
question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful
cattle" ("TB," 314). Such an apparently random list of words does not
make sense until we recognize that Stein is abstracting the definition of
"boxiness." A box is a container for particular objects: "boxiness," Stein
suggests, embodies the relationship between a set and its examples. Thus
to define "a box" she writes a sentence containing variations

<b></b>

on the formulaic phrase, "out of set-<i>x</i> comes
<i>y</i>-example." Blushing ("redness") might indicate that a compliment
has been paid (a "kindness"), hounding someone with a repetitive
"same question" is an example of "rudeness," while "research" is
anything produced by looking around (with "an eye"). In each case,
Stein's words are potentially replaceable, marked by implied&#8212;but
not printed&#8212;quotation marks. Each word is a possible defined
value for either <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>. Set-<i>x</i> equals "kindness,"
"rudeness" or "an eye," while example-<i>y</i> equals "redness," "rapid
same question" or "research". To understand her intended meaning, you
must not only know what the words mean; you must also recognize the
entire sentence's repetitive formula. You must understand, moreover,
that implied quotation marks signal a word as one example of a set,
even though these quotation marks are not literally present.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Such grammar games continue throughout <i>Tender Buttons</i>, becoming
more and more complicated by "Rooms."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
But regardless of the complexity of her sentences, she always intends
to mean with her texts, even when the words she chooses, "were not the
words that had in them any quality of description."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
A reader might make mistakes when attempting to punctuate, and
understand, one of these sentences for himself. But that, as Stein
would say, is the reader's "business," not hers. Her aim is to choose
words so carefully, and to construct sentences so scrupulously, that
punctuation marks are not required: the words and syntax are doing
the work the punctuation marks used to do. Her meaning is there to be
found, even if such sentences initially appear nonsensical. "I made
innumerable efforts to make words write without sense," Stein wrote,
"and found it impossible."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
From a purely literary historical standpoint, one purpose of my
description is to rectify the mistaken lineage often provided for Stein
by contemporary literary critics, where she most typically emerges as a
poststructuralist poet <i>avant la lettre</i>. In Perloff's words, Stein
intends to dramatize "the arbitrariness of discourse, the impossibility
of arriving at 'the meaning' even as countless possible meanings present
themselves to our attention" (<i>POI</i>, 76). In fact, as I have been
stressing, Stein is completely indifferent to the reader's particular
perspective. But for Perloff, because Stein's meaning "all depends
on our angle of vision," Stein's writing parallels "the instability,
indeterminacy, and acoherence of Cubism" (<i>POI</i>, 76-7). According
to these views, Stein intends transgressive indeterminacy, and her
most fascinating characteristic, according to Charles Altieri, is her
"freedom of linguistic play."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
For critics such as Perloff, Altieri, and Jayne Walker, <i>Tender
Buttons</i> is valued for the dramatic effects of its grammar games,
syntax disruption, and language obfuscation; it is "a text to play with."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
But just as Stein does not care where or when the reader breathes,
she also does not care how much fun the reader is having. She creates
texts that mean what they mean regardless of her reader's desires to
play with them.
<p>
Closely related to these poststructuralist interpretations are depictions
of Stein as the harbinger of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets such as Bruce Andrews,
Charles Bernstein, Lyn Hejinian, and Susan Howe. These poets readily adopt
Stein as the poetic matriarch of their "radical modernism"&#8212;a kind
of incipient postmodernism suggested by the "nonuse value of language
in Stein."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Accordingly, the December

<b></b>

1978 issue of the journal <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> contains a special
feature of seven poets interpreting <i>Tender Buttons</i>. But in contrast
to my reading of Stein (namely, that for her the reader's experience
is irrelevant to the meaning of the poem), these poets value <i>Tender
Buttons</i> for precisely the opposite reason. Michael Davidson and
Bruce Andrews believe the poem incorporates each reader's experience
into the meaning of the text so that <i>Tender Buttons</i> increases
the "possibilities for meaning" as it is read by more and more people,
because "readers do the rewriting."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Extending this logic, Bernstein understands poetry's value as the "sum
of all the specific conditions of the experience (place, time, order,
light, mood, position, to infinity) made available by reading."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
If Stein's point is that the Waterloo painting eliminates the relevance
of the world outside the painting (the world of air, light and time),
Bernstein's point&#8212;in contrast&#8212;is to underscore the total
significance of "the specific conditions of the experience" that make
up the reader's world. Not only do the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets value
Stein for exactly the wrong reasons, these poets also contribute to
the inaccurate&#8212;but canonical&#8212;view of Stein as the first
modernist poet of indeterminacy and reader-derived meaning.
<p>
In addition to these literary historical aims, my point in
discussing Stein's notion of painting and writing is to show that
Stein understood the irrelevance of the beholder (of a painting) as
related to the irrelevance of the reader. In both painting and writing
the audience's "job" is distinct from the artist's. One might imagine
that I am aiming to replace the contemporary description of Stein
(as a proto-poststructuralist or an ancestral L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet),
with another, unlikely label: Stein as an expatriate New Critic in
avant-garde clothing, promoting the autonomous poetic object. New
Critics W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley, for example, argue that
one's affective responses to a poem do not lead to satisfying critical
inquiries: readers must avoid the "Affective Fallacy," that situation
where the "poem itself, as an object of specifically critical judgment,
tends to disappear" in the surge of the reader's emotional response.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
It might appear, therefore, that Stein's theory of poetic meaning
resembles the New Critical poetic "objects" and their relation to the
reader&#8212;Stein, Wimsatt, and Beardsley all want more emphasis on the
poem as object, and less on the reader's emotional response to the poem.
<p>
But there are crucial differences between Stein's account of the
irrelevance of the reader and the New Critics' privileging of the
poetic object over the reader's response. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the
danger of the Affective Fallacy is that a poem's meaning could&#8212;and
does&#8212;"disappear" in the presence of readerly emotion. In response,
Wimsatt and Beardsley aim to protect the poem (like museum guards around
a Monet) from the audience members whose enthusiasm might besmirch the
work. But for Stein, there is no need to protect the poem from the
reader because this particular hazard does not exist. Or, to put it
more precisely, this particular hazard <i>cannot</i> exist. A poem's
meaning is never in danger of being effaced by the reader&#8212;however
radical the reader's interpretation&#8212;because the reader's response,
<i>by definition</i>, cannot alter the poem's meaning in any way. The
meaning of a poem is entirely indifferent to the reader's emotion, or,
for that matter, indifferent to any type of judgment the reader

<b></b>

could deliver. Thus, unlike Wimsatt and Beardsley, Stein is not
prioritizing objective over subjective responses: each is just as
inevitable&#8212;and irrelevant&#8212;to the meaning of the text.
<p>
Stein's decision to remove all forms of diacritical, readerly assistance
(commas, quotation marks, etc.) is the logical extension of her theory
of textual meaning. Your breath as a reader&#8212;and at the most basic
level, everything particular to you as a person&#8212;is irrelevant to
her meaning. Not only does Stein present a challenge to poststructuralist
and postmodern theory&#8212;and particularly to those poststructuralist
accounts of her own poetry, where meaning "all depends on our angle
of vision" (<i>POI</i>, 76)&#8212;she also presents a challenge to the
New Critical account of poetry as a cultural artifact endangered by the
reader's misinterpretation. My literary historical argument about Stein,
therefore, is also her theoretical argument about literary meaning.

3 Lewis's Texts Without Time
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Considering Lewis's and Stein's shared commitment to avant-garde art and
literature, and more relevantly, their common interest in the relation of
art to the beholder, one might have suspected some mutual understanding
between them. Stein was largely supportive of and amused by Lewis; Lewis,
on the other hand, despised Stein and her work. In some respects, his
repugnance is a predictable version of the received account of Lewis as
a hostile, misogynous, anti-Semite. Most often, his antipathy appears as
hysterical aversion: Stein is a phony member of the avant-garde&#8212;"a
faux-naif" and "a sham"&#8212;because she produced fake art.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Lewis also implies that she attempts to emasculate young (white)
male writers, such as Ernest Hemingway, by overpowering them with her
monstrous, female (Jewish) persona.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
But these deliberately offensive accusations are a type of rhetorical
camouflage, masking a far greater anxiety. Stein threatened Lewis's
description of himself as "The Enemy"&#8212;that is, the outspoken
<i>artiste</i> in the liminal world of avant-garde modernism. "I defend
my choice of her as an enemy at all times and in all places," he writes
in "The Diabolical Principle and the Dithryambic Spectator," an essay
first published in one of Lewis's critical organs, a periodical he in
fact named <i>The Enemy</i>.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Even this indictment suggests a problem: if Stein is "The Enemy's" enemy
in <i>The Enemy</i>, Lewis's singularity and novelty are precarious.
<p>
Although Lewis despises what he believes is Stein's "bad philosophy,"
that philosophy was far closer to Lewis's than he was in a position
to admit. Like Stein, Lewis is repeatedly focusing not on the relation
between a representation and the object represented, but on the relation
between the space of the painting and the space of the beholder. Consider,
once again, the scene of Pullman and Satters encountering the painting in
<i>The Childermass</i>. "Milky" wall surfaces dissolve instantaneously,
and the dusky shafts of sunlight are more dense than they appear:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
These solid luminous slices have the consistence of smoked glass:
apparitions gradually take shape in their substance, hesitate or arrive
with fixity, become delicately plastic,

<b></b>

increase their size, burst out of the wall like an inky exploding
crysalid. . . . Satters surreptitiously reaches out his hand to the
cutting edge of the light. It is hard, it's more like marble. It is
<i>not</i> sunlight or it is frozen beams. He hastilywithdraws his hand,
looking to see if Pullman has noticed. (<i>TC</i>, 40)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Lewis, a professional painter as well as a novelist, depicts light
filtering through air as a thick, viscous substance, perhaps the
consistency of oil paint as it is applied to a canvas (initially gooey and
finally solidifying). The image of enlarging apparitions which "burst out
of the wall like an inky exploding crysalid" also suggests a painting in
the process of its creation. But Pullman and Satters are able to see the
paint and the painting&#8212;and <i>nothing</i> else: not the canvas,
not the paintbrush, not anything surrounding the painting. The artist,
who sometimes paints slowly and hesitantly, and sometimes creates forms
boldly and quickly, is also invisible: "apparitions gradually take
shape in their substance, hesitate or arrive with fixity." In other
words, Satters and Pullman experience this painting-apparition not as a
representation, but as part of the physical world in which they themselves
exist, a world in which Satters can touch the solid sunlight.
<p>
By the final scene inside the purgatory-painting, it is clear that this
painting&#8212;indistinguishable from the physical world&#8212;does not
fulfill Lewis's notion of a representation. The incident begins when
Satters becomes distraught by the hostile reception he receives from
an eighteenth-century "ploughman" in the painting: "His face terrified
me! I didn't tell you at the time&#8212;I felt he knew quite well you
were looking at him! . . . I feel we ought not to be here. . . . I feel
an intruder. . . . I feel I'm trespassing" (<i>TC</i>, 112-3). Satters
senses that his gaze is acknowledged by the res represented,
leading him to experience anxiety and dislocation. In a sense, it
is as if the painting&#8212;through the ral representations in
it&#8212;<i>wants</i> to exclude him from the representation but cannot
("I feel we ought not to be here. . . . I feel an intruder"). In other
words, the invisible frame they have stepped through has failed as
a barrier to halt them in front of the painting. Satters becomes so
disturbed by the hostile reception he receives that he picks a t
with the "ploughman," eventually mangling the representation "out of
human recognition" (<i>TC</i>, 130). With this act of disration,
Satters and Pullman are violently expelled from the painting: "the light
is extinguished in a black flash and they are flung upon their faces"
(<i>TC</i>, 130). Not only are they expunged from the painting, but the
panorama itself disappears. By interacting with painted representations,
Satters brings about the destruction of the painting.
<p>
Thus halfway through the novel, Lewis reveals the true function of
this painting: to provide a satire of the contemporary understanding
of painting as a space the beholder can enter. The disappearance of the
painting is the key to this long scene, for Satters and Pullman are the
satiric "puppets" who (unwittingly) bring about the result Lewis felt was
inevitable: art that a person can enter into will lead to the destruction
of art. <i>The Childermass</i> is, in fact, one of the sharpest examples
of Lewis's satire&#8212;a genre so significant to him that he considered
it the modern art <i>par excellence</i>, encompassing both his fiction
and his painting strategies.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
He does not simply present us with a modern version of purgatory as
situational comedy (although the novel often does that 

<b></b>
too).
Instead, Lewis imagines a visual illustration of "time-philosophy," the
modern preoccupation with temporal experience that he spends 500 pages
disparaging and discrediting in <i>Time and Western Man</i> ,
the aethestic-poltical-philosophical treatise he published one year
before<i>The Childermass</i>. Pullman&#8212;Lewis's surrogate&#8212;is
unperturbed to enter a panorama that is "like a picture," because
this panorama fails as a representation: "This is nothing. . . . It's
hollow! It's only Time!" (<i>TWM</i>, 105-6). Pullman need not treat
it like a painting (that is, by standing in front of it and looking
at it), but can walk into it, as an atmospheric disturbance: "It's a
time-hallucination&#8212;we don't get them often but I've seen several"
(<i>TWM</i>, 105). It might be disruptive, but it is not art: the
experience of air in time is only as interesting or uninteresting as
the weather.
<p>
For Lewis, the crucial characteristic of art&#8212;such as his own
abstract, Vorticist painting&#8212;is that it is a different order of
experience from reality, or "life," chiefly because it is a form of life
that does not rely upon time.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Thus he writes in <i>Blast I</i> , his early Vorticist polemic,
that art is "in no way directly dependent on 'Life.' It is no EQUIVALENT
for Life, but ANOTHER life [what Stein calls "a life of its own"],
as NECESSARY to existence as the former."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
In contrast, the "time-hallucination" Pullman and Satters have
walked into relies upon the viewer's experience in life to produce
its meaning. Tarr (another Lewis surrogate) argues a similar point
against time-painting: "<i>Life</i> is anything that could live and
die. <i>Art</i> is peculiar; it is anything that lives and yet you
cannot imagine as dying."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
When Anastaysa, Tarr's intellectual partner, counters with a familiar
rebuttal, "Why cannot art die? If you smash up a statue, it is as
dead as a dead man," Tarr remains adamant: "No, it is not. That is the
difference. It is the God, or soul, we say, of the man. It always has
existed, if it is a true statue."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The reason the work of art cannot die is because to die is to stop
breathing, and the work of art cannot stop breathing because the work
of art never was breathing. In other words, Lewis argues, art is a
form of life, but with crucial differences: it is a life without air,
without the particularities of a certain place at a specific time, and
without the possibility of death. For Lewis, all these characteristics
of art can be redescribed as life without the experience of time. In
contrast, the panorama Pullman and Satters encounter is <i>only</i>
a time-experience: they could go around it, but even "that would take
hours"; instead they choose to go through it, which also necessarily
takes time, albeit "a few minutes" (<i>TC</i>, 106).
<p>
In <i>Blast I</i>, <i>Caliph's Design</i> and <i>Time and Western Man</i>,
Lewis presents most of the major modern art movements (including
Impressionism, Futurism and Surrealism), as manifestations of "the
prevalent time-doctrine" (<i>TWM</i>, 451).
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
He argues that the Impressionist commitment to quick, <i>en plein air</i>
painting is, in fact, a commitment to temporality. Just as Marcel Proust
"embalms" his past in <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i>, so does
Claude Monet embalm his experience of a moment of morning light (and,
in other paintings, afternoon light, noon light, and dusky light)
on the Rouen Cathedral. Futurism fares little better (dismissed as
Impressionism with cars, or "automobilism"), while Surrealism aims to
make art "super-real" by mummifying reality.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Oswald Spengler's theory of art, according to Lewis, is one of the
clearest articulations of time-philosophy's aesthetic philosophy:
because Spengler conceives of art as a "full, coloured, breathing
materiality . . . it not only dies <i>for ever</i>, but everything
about it dies <i>for ever</i>. There is nothing 'universal' left in
it" (<i>TWM</i>, 267). When Spengler conceives of art as alive in
time&#8212;with a "breathing materiality"&#8212;he describes an art
<i>with air</i>. Such art is flooded by experiences of time, by the
particularities and contingencies of its temporal existence. Lewis
presses his point further. The contemporary audience of time-philosophy
art is not satisfied with "a picture, a representation." Instead, "we
exact <i>real</i> blood and tears. We want, in short, <i>reality</i>"
(<i>TWM</i>, 271). By opposing reality ("<i>real</i>blood and tears")
to a representation ("a picture"), Lewis underscores the opposition
between time-art and a representation. By breaking down the distinction
between art and life, a time-philosophy object&#8212;whether it is a
painting by Salvador Dal&iacute; or the painting Pullman and Satters
walk through&#8212;is a social phenomenon as opposed to an aesthetic one.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
As Lewis puts it, time-art "no longer stands for itself" (<i>TWM</i>,
274).
<p>
Lewis, who is rarely credited with a coherent theory of representation,
is actually consistently&#8212;satirically&#8212;expressing one. Most
importantly, what initially appears to be the characteristic of his
divergence from Stein&#8212;the air in the painting&#8212;turns out to
be an endorsement of her theory (although Lewis would never imagine
himself aligned with Stein). Just as Stein removes commas from her
poetry to exclude the audience's breath from the meaning of her text,
Lewis scorns time-art for its "breathing materiality" (<i>TWM</i>,
267). In fact, Lewis's condemnation of <i>The Childermass</i> painting
as a "time-hallucination" takes Stein's theory and expands on it. By
rejecting time from art, Lewis is not just ignoring the physical existence
of the audience via his or her breath. He is attempting to withhold from
art that which any living creature needs to sustain itself: regular,
repeated intakes of air, over a sustained period of <i>time</i>. His
repudiation of time-philosophy is, in essence, a sweeping rejection of
the experience of the viewer or reader to the meaning of the work of
art. However fleeting a human experience might be, it must have duration.
<p>
I am suggesting that Lewis and Stein&#8212;one hostile to the other
and neither of them aligned by critics&#8212;actually hold a similar
theory of the art object, and from their understanding of the relation
between painting and the beholder we can deduce a whole set of other
issues. Consider, first of all, the literary historical claims: my reading
goes against the accepted view of both Stein and Lewis. In section two,
I argued that Stein is not trying to produce indeterminate meaning, and
thus she cannot be satisfactorily categorized as a poststructuralist or
a postmodernist (as is often attempted). While the critical consensus
on Lewis is less unified (in part because many studies of his work do
not tackle his complicated aesthetic theory), the style of his satirical
writing has led critics to interpret it as incipiently postmodern.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
David Peters Corbett, for example, interprets Lewis's work as,
" . . . radically ambiguous&#8212;at once essential to all human
experience and claustrophobically private."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Jessica Burstein provides a provocative account of Lewis's "cold
modernism" (characterized by prosthetic devices and beetle shells),
also taking its implicit cue from postmodernism.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Fredric Jameson most explicitly

<b></b>

claims Lewis's modernism as postmodernism by noting, "the striking
similarities between Lewis' undertaking and the contemporary
poststructuralist aesthetic, which signals the dissolution of the
modernist paradigm . . . and foretells the emergence of some new,
properly postmodernist or schizophrenic conception of the cultural
artifact. . . . "
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Jameson characterizes Lewis's narrative as an unconscious, postmodern
critique of political ideology; a Lewis novel "frees its ideological
content to demonstrate its own contradictions" (<i>FOA</i>,
22-3). According to Jameson, Lewis's "protofascism" is, in fact, a
sophisticated, life-long opposition to traditional Marxism, and thus such
"protofascism," has more in common with Althusserian theory than with
Hitler's policies. But my point here is that Lewis is not producing a
postmodern "cultural artifact," and thus his "protofascism" cannot be
rationalized as a postmodern ideological critique.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Instead, Lewis aims&#8212;quite explicitly&#8212;to produce a satire
of the most egregious cultural phenomenon (in his view)&#8212;the
"Time Cult." The other effects generated (i.e., narrative discontinuity
and prosthetic persons) are not indications of his postmodernism, but
side-effects of his comprehensive satirical goal. Moreover, by rejecting
the idea that the spectator's experience is part of the meaning of
the work, Lewis is also rejecting any theory&#8212;poststructuralist,
postmodernist, reader-response or some other variation&#8212;that values
the spectator's contribution to the work of art.
<p>
In other words, Lewis is producing not the first example of postmodernism,
but the first critique of it. The "time-hallucination" painting
in<i>The Childermass</i> (which has been wholly neglected by critics),
does not raise issues in the realist tradition, such as how a painting
depicting real life relates to the subject matter it represents. Instead,
time-painting foregrounds the issue of whether an art work even has an
impenetrable frame that stops you, physically, at the surface of the
painting. Lewis is, in fact, anticipating a version of Michael Fried's
central theory of twentieth-century modern painting, articulated decades
later in "Art and Objecthood" . As in Stein's essays and Lewis's
novel, in Fried's essay the focus is on the relationship between the art
object and its beholder. Noting the escalating dominance of the physical
object to one's experience of art, Fried argues that the central struggle
in modernist painting is to "undo or neutralize objecthood in one way
or another," by opposing all manner of literality (<i>AAO</i>, 41). In
contrast, the Minimalist art of the 1960s, represented by Tony Smith,
Robert Morris and Donald Judd (among others), "offered their audience
a kind of heightened perceptual experience" of the object in its
installation space (<i>AAO</i>, 40). Instead of defeating objecthood,
Minimalist art relished in objecthood by establishing the spectator's
experience as an essential part of a work's meaning.
<p>
Temporality, as Fried notes, is crucially connected to the notion of
objecthood. Unlike the modern painting and sculpture of Frank Stella
and Anthony Caro, Minimalist art "was preoccupied with experiences that
persist in time; the 'presentment' of duration, of 'time itself as though
it were some sort of literalist object (<i>AAO</i>, 44).'"
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Fried and Lewis both believe that temporality is part of the destruction
of art; for Fried, temporality is another version of objecthood, while
for Lewis, temporality is the crucial aspect of experience and thus the
chief threat to art. Moreover, one crucial aspect of Fried's theory is
that art cannot simply disregard literality (or temporality); it must

<b></b>

defeat the theatrical presence of the literal object. When Pullmann and
Satters are unable to perceive the physical conditions of painting as
distinct from representation&#8212;that is, they cannot see the canvas
but can perceive the oil painting emerging as "an inky exploding crysalid"
(<i>TC</i>, 40)&#8212;the novel is depicting time-painting simply ignoring
its physical conditions, instead of acknowledging and overcoming those
physical conditions. In a sense, Lewis is ridiculing time-painting's
status as <i>only</i> an object in the world, and thus an experience
of time. But the essential point here&#8212;that the experience of
temporality in art is anathema to art&#8212;is identical in both Fried
and Lewis.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
The writers and artists Lewis denounces venerate time as a literal object
(in his view) instead of aiming to defeat objecthood.
<p>
The time-art Lewis warns against persists in other postmodern
movements, such as Conceptual, Earthworks, Happenings, and Performance
art. Earthworks artist Dennis Oppenheim notes that, "sculptors have
never been as dynamically involved in time as they are now."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
The decision by these artists to make art in and of the landscape
foregrounds the spectator's involvement in durational art.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Most recently, the summer 2002 "Tempo" exhibition at the Museum
of Modern Art (in Queens), "focuses on distinct perceptions of
time&#8212;phenomenological, empirical, political, and fictional," by
including works which require the spectator's physical involvement. Erwin
Wurm's <i>One Minute Sculpture</i> is a performance series that instructs
each museum-goer to complete a 60-second action ("Hold your breath and
think of Spinoza").
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Such a work illustrates Lewis's point: time-art involves "the
<i>merging of art in life</i>" in order to produce a social experience
in life&#8212;"not an aesthetic phenomenon" (<i>DPDS</i>, 68-9).
<p>
But besides these literary historical and art historical arguments (that
it does not work to see either Stein, or Lewis, as postmodern), Stein's
and Lewis's view that everything outside the "frame" of their work is
irrelevant to meaning is one version of a major, twentieth-century
theoretical debate. By focusing on the ontology of the art object,
Stein and Lewis are in fact calling attention to a more general set of
beliefs concerning the relation between a thing and its place. Their
view is that an object and its place are entirely separate conceptions,
and that the artist should aim to maintain that separation. Thus a poem
is distinct from its reception in the world, a painting is distinct from
its frame. In the subsequent chapters of the dissertation, I show how
this notion of an object's connection to place has reemerged in recent
literary theory in the guise of a radically different topic: diaspora. But
if the problem of the diasporic differs from Stein and Lewis's interests
in the ontology of the work of art, the basic structure of the debate
is the same. Specifically, recent theories of diaspora replace the thing
with a person, and the place with a nation. Instead of the question, How
does an object relate to where it is in the world, the question is now,
In what sense is a people related to the place they are from?

Stein is introducing a sophisticated rendering of her relationship
to painting here, one which is remarkably akin to Michael Fried's
revolutionary claims decades later. In a series of essays and books,
Fried argues, "that for Diderot and the French anti-theatrical tradition
generally, the painter's task was crucially to negate or neutralize what
I have called the primordial convention that paintings are made to be
beheld. This was to be done, in the first place, by depicting res
so engrossed or . . . <i>absorbed</i> in what they were doing, thinking,
and feeling that they appeared oblivious of everything else, including,
crucially, the beholder standing before the painting;" Michael Fried,
<i>Art and Objecthood: Essays and Reviews</i> (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press, 1998), 47-8, henceforth abbreviated as <i>AAO</i>. A
successful rendering of absorption could lead to a painter's "ultimate
purpose&#8212;bringing actual viewers to halt in front of the painting
and holding them there in a virtual trance of imaginative involvement;"
<i>AAO</i>, 48. It is precisely this "virtual trance" that Stein describes
repeatedly in her essays, stemming from painting's ability to "give me
pleasure and hold my attention" (Stein, "P", 225).

Of course, this is complicated by the fact that Satters and Pullman are
already dead, and their experience in the afterlife is as close to life
as they can get. But instead of problematizing my argument, this point
is in fact a support of it. Lewis is suggesting that air-filled painting
is nearly indistinguishable&#8212;not just from real-life&#8212;but from
an attenuated after-life in purgatory.

My larger project concerns the ontology of the work of art, not only
in Stein and Lewis, but also in William Carlos Williams, Charles Olson,
Marcel Duchamp, and more contemporary writers and artists including Amiri
Baraka, Robert Smithson and Leslie Marmon Silko. Each is interested in the
nature of the object and hence the position of the subject (both reader
and writer) in relation to the object. In taking up an aesthetic problem
at the heart of modernism&#8212;and postmodernism&#8212;I also explore
related political projects. In fact, I argue that writers with political
positions as different as Stein's suffragism, Lewis's anti-Communist
comopolitanism (and, as I suggest in subsequent chapters, Williams's
diasporic nativism, Olson's New Deal liberalism and Baraka's Black
Nationalism) are all committed to deriving their politics from their
vision of the work of art, a vision articulated by each in terms of air.

Stein's relationship to success was complicated. On the one hand, she
reported being hurt by people's failure to understand her meaning. She
compares the public rejection of her poetry to the initial rejection
of Matisse's painting: "she could not understand why it infuriated
everybody . . . it bothered her and angered her . . . just as later she
did not understand why since the writing was all so clear and natural
they mocked at and were enraged by her work" (Stein, "Autobiography",
<i>V1</i>, 693, henceforth abbreviated as "A"). But on the other hand,
she takes this initial confusion and rejection to be a validation of
her poetic genius and her poetry's semi-conscious staying power: "They
always say . . . that my writing is appalling but they always quote it
and what is more, they quote it correctly. . . . My sentences do get
under their skin, only they do not know that they do" ("A," 730).

At first glance, it might seem easier to justify the reader's "business"
of absorption than the writer's absorption in her own words. Stein,
while interested in both, is aesthetically committed to the writer's
to a greater extent. In her essay, "What is English Literature",
she characterizes this pleasure of concentration with the text not in
terms of the reader's engrossment, but the writer's "choice between
serving god and mammon . . . [which] has nothing to do with religion,
it has nothing to with success. It has to do with completion" ("WIEL,"
202). The reference here is to the <i>New Testament</i> ("No one
can serve two masters. . . . You cannot serve God and wealth", Matt
6:24&#8212;"mammon" is Greek for "wealth"). If a writer uses words
"indirectly" then he or she is serving mammon, and by extension, the
reader. Thus in choosing to write to a particular audience, the writer
is choosing particularity and materialism (hence "mammon") over God,
and losing her "direct" relationship to words.

<p>
<a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>.
Stein considers and rejects various forms of punctuation for several
pages. Questions and exclamations are implied in a sentence's form,
"and so why add to it the question mark . . . exclamation marks have
the same difficulty" ("PAG," 317). Other marks are rejected because they
resemble commas: colons and semi-colons "are definitely more commas than
period . . . they really have within them deeply within them fundamentally
within them the comma nature" ("PAG," 319).
<p>
<a name="FOOT17" href="#REF17">17</a>.
One of the most suggestive and illuminating readings of "A BOX" is William
Gass's, "Gertrude Stein and the Geography of the Sentence," in <i>The
World within the Word</i> (New York: Knopf, 1978), 63-123. He suggests
that Stein's "manifest text" is actually a "<i>coded commentary</i> on
the covert texts" (<i>The World within the Word</i>, 92). Gass, however,
does not consider how Stein's removal of punctuation marks alters the
typical interpretation of these poems, nor does he consider Stein's
reasons for their removal as part of her larger aesthetic.
<p>
<a name="FOOT18" href="#REF18">18</a>.
Consider the following example in which Stein presents a series of noun
modifiers which are sorted out as the sentence continues: "Blind and weak
and organised and worried and betrothed and resumed and never startled
and not at all bloated, this which is no rarer than frequently is not so
astonishing when hair brushing is added," ("TB," 347). As with "A BOX,"
this sentence is baffling until one recognizes the categorization of words
by part of speech. "Blind," "weak," "organized," "worried" and so on are
examples of adjectives, while "startled" is "never" in this set because
it is a verb ("startling" is the correct adjective). "Not at all bloated"
might appear problematic&#8212;"bloated" is an adjective&#8212;until we
realize that the entire phrase, "not at all bloated" is an adjectival
phrase (as in, "the not at all bloated sponge"). Thus Stein includes "not
at all bloated" because it suggests the difficulty of categorization when
certain words have several possible syntactical functions. "This," for
example, can be either a pronoun or a demonstrative adjective: hence the
"astonishing" situation of "this" functioning as both a pronoun (as in
the phrase, "this which is no rarer than . . . ") and as a demonstrative
adjective (as in the <i>second</i> "this" of "This is this dress, aider,"
<i>V1 ,</i> 326). The sentence concludes with an adverb ("frequently")
and verb participle ("hair brushing") because both have syntactically
dual roles.

Satire for Lewis "is nothing else but the truth", but "it is the 'truth'
of the intellect" instead of the "'truth' of the average romantic
sensualism'" (Lewis, <i>MWA</i>, 99-100). Lewis emphasizes the intellect
in contrast to "romantic sensualism" in order to distinguish his work from
escapist fiction, which denies the reality of the modern world. While the
"plain-reader" might suppose that "the author . . . is mainly occupied
with the problem of taking us out of ourselves . . . making us live for
a few hours a more exciting life than our own" (<i>MWA</i>, 11), the
satirist aims for a <i>permanent</i> art that is altogether different and
more substantial because it requires "the entire human capacity&#8212;for
sensation, reflection, imagination, and will" (<i>MWA</i>, 12). Satire
is also like Lewis's Vorticist painting because both aim to criticize
modern culture, without merely attempting to escape from it: "Vorticism
accepted the machine-world: that is the point to stress. . . . This,
of course, serves to define Vorticism as the opposite of an 'escapist'
doctrine." From <i>Wyndham Lewis on Art: Collected Writings 1913-1956</i>,
ed. Walter Michel and C. J. Fox (New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1969), 340.
<p>
<a name="FOOT31" href="#REF31">31</a>.
Vorticism essentially emerged from Lewis's Vorticist "Manifesto" in
<i>Blast 1</i>, the magazine he edited in 1914. The various artists and
writers associated with the magazine included Ezra Pound, Rebecca West,
Ford Maddox Ford, Gaudier-Brzeska, Edward Wadsworth, and Jacob Epstein
(among others). In Charles Harrison's words, Vorticism was "determinedly
anti-Victorian and anti-picturesque"; "The mechanical and the geometric
were upheld against the organic and the naturalistic, energy against
sensibility, will against morality." Charles Harrison, <i>English Art
and Modernism: 1900-1939</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1981),
111. Vorticism has been compared to (and is at least related to), Cubism,
Futurism, and Expressionism.

The one major art movement Lewis is ambivalent towards is Cubism. Although
he sometimes dismissed Cubist still-life paintings with the punning
label, "Nature Mortism", he was also admittedly indebted to the Cubism
he sometimes "blasted." His training at the Slade might have left him
fairly hostile to new, continental European art movements, but by 1911
his painting showed the influence of Picasso's and Braque's developing
Analytical Cubist style. See "Chapter 4: Cubism, Futurism, Vorticism," in
Harrison, <i>English Art and Modernism</i>, 75-113; and "Chapter 3: Matter
and Creation: Painting, 1911-1912," in Paul Edwards, <i>Wyndham Lewis:
Painter and Writer</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000), 53-94.
<p>
<a name="FOOT36" href="#REF36">36</a>.
Lewis's term "Automobilism" comes from <i>Blast</i>: "Futurism, as
preached by Marinetti, is largely Impressionism up=to=date. To this is
added his Automobilism and Nietzsche stunt," (Lewis, <i>Blast I</i>,
143). Lewis complains that the Futurists' relationship to machinery is
more like worship. They are too emotional and not thoughtful enough:
"not a deliberate and reasoned enthusiasm for the possibilities that
lie in this new spectacle of machinery; of the <i>use</i> it can be
put to in art." Wyndham Lewis, <i>Caliph's Design: Architects! Where
is your Vortex? ,</i> ed. Paul Edwards (Santa Barbara: Black Sparrow
Press, 1986), 57. But the larger complaint against Futurism was that it
stemmed from Impressionism, without advancing on what the Impressionists
attempted: "The Futurists, and their French followers, have as the
basis of their aesthetic the Impressionists generally. They are simply
a rather abstruse and complex form of the 1880 French Impressionists"
(<i>Caliph's Design</i>, 104).
<p>
<a name="FOOT37" href="#REF37">37</a>.
His specific argument against Surrealism works as follows: The surrealists
"pass over into the living material of all art, its ground and what it
contemplates, and . . . tamper directly with the cezannesque apples,
for instance, before the painter has started his picture" (<i>DPDS</i>,
67). In other

<b></b>

words, when the surrealists transform an apple before painting it,
they effectively aim to alter life, instead of art. Since Surrealism is
"the <i>merging of art in life</i>" (<i>DPDS</i>, 69), it is therefore,
"not an aesthetic phenomenon" at all, but a <i>social</i> phenomenon
(<i>DPDS</i>, 68). As Lewis describes in a later essay, the spectator
of art should "not be required to participate in any way in the real",
for art is "something outside 'the real'&#8212;outside the temporal
order&#8212;altogether" (Lewis, "Super-Nature versus Super-Real," in
<i>Wyndham Lewis on Art</i>, 331-2). Lewis is fundamentally opposed to
art which requires the spectator to experience reality as presence;
that is, an art which insists upon the spectator's experience of the
object in real-time.
<p>
<a name="FOOT38" href="#REF38">38</a>.
Other critics who propose significant, theoretical interconnections
between Lewis's art and writing&#8212;as do Paul Peppis, Tom Normand,
and Reed Way Dasenbrock&#8212;tend to focus on the early Vorticist
manifestos in relation to Lewis's politics, philosophy and painting,
instead of <i>The Childermass</i>. See Paul Peppis, <i>Literature,
Politics, and the English Avant-Garde: Nation and Empire, 1901-1918</i>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000); Tom Normand, <i>Wyndham
Lewis the Artist: Holding the Mirror up to Politics</i> (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1992); Reed Way Dasenbrock, <i>The Literary
Vorticism of Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis: Towards the Condition of
Painting</i> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). More
generally, literary critics have neglected <i>The Childermass</i>
in favor of <i>Tarr</i>, <i>The Revenge for Love</i> and other Lewis
works, which also means that critics have ignored the extent to which
this lengthy scene of Pullman and Satters walking into a painting
is a powerful narrative example for many of Lewis's aesthetic and
philosophical writings. Exceptions include Hugh Kenner, Peter Caracciolo
and Daniel Schenker, who provide valuable insights into the novel, but
nonetheless neglect the scene of the painting: Hugh Kenner, <i>Wyndham
Lewis</i> (Norfolk, CT: New Directions, 1954); Peter L. Caracciolo,

<i>The Childermass</i>," in Robert Fraser (ed.), <i>Sir James Frazer and

Fredric Jameson, <i>Fables of Aggression: Wyndham Lewis, the Modernist
as Fascist</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), 19-20,
henceforth abbreviated as <i>FOA</i>. Jameson, of course, was also trying
to argue that despite Lewis's poststructuralist maneuvers ("stressing
discontinuity, allegory, the mechanical, the gap between signifier and
signified, the lapse in meaning," <i>FOA</i>, 20), Lewis "cannot be fully
assimilated to the contemporary textual aesthetic without anachronism: we
will indeed want to insist on the ways in which these tendencies are over
and over again strategically recontained in his work" (<i>FOA</i>, 20).
<p>
<a name="FOOT42" href="#REF42">42</a>.
In the dissertation, I consider this issue of Lewis's "protofascism"
at more length. Lewis's disturbing flirtation with fascism is undeniably
problematic, but Jameson's account of Lewis's "protofascism" as a form of
postmodern ideological critique does not solve the problem. In fact, in
<i>The Childermass</i>, the re Pullman and Satters nearly kill is none
other than Thomas Paine himself, the father of modern representational
democracy. Thus Lewis is suggesting that stepping inside a painting
full of air&#8212;an instantiation of time-philosophy&#8212;threatens
the very possibility of representation. His point is that the frameless
art of time-philosophy not only corrupts representation in <i>art</i>;
time-philosophy also undermines <i>political</i> representation by
creating a world in which persons and representations appear to be
equal. The "loutish" Satters destroys the re of Paine because he
feels that this re is a threat to himself. It is time-philosophy's
corruption of representation&#8212;<i>both</i> aesthetic and
political&#8212;that Lewis is focusing on here: <i>aesthetic</i>
because Paine is a ral representation in the painting, and
<i>political</i> because Paine is a historical symbol of political
representation. Therefore, Lewis is not <i>theoretically</i> opposed
to a liberal politics, nor is he postmodern: instead, he contemplates
the ultimate fate of the modern democratic state when the very notion
of representation is under enormous strain by people as thoughtless as
Satters. In an effort to avoid the destruction of representation, Lewis
produces his own version of an art without time: intricate, semi-abstract
self-portraits of himself as a beetle on covers of his magazine, <i>The
Enemy</i> (1926-27).

<b></b>

<p>
<a name="FOOT43" href="#REF43">43</a>.
In Minimalism, literality manifests itself as framelessness, instantiated
for Fried in Tony Smith's sublime car trip on the unfinished New
Jersey Turnpike. Smith describes the moment at which painting
ends, when he realizes that his experience of this ride cannot be
represented pictorially: "there is no way you can frame it, you just
have to experience it" (quoted in <i>AAO</i>, 158). In other words,
Tony Smith, according to Fried, eliminates the frame of a painting by
first reconceptualizing it as a frame of window that can be physically
traversed in time&#8212;precisely like Pullman and Satters' journey into
the panorama in <i>The Childermass</i>. These are both versions of the
ruptured frame between art and life. By turning the picture frame into
a window frame, both Smith and the time-philosophers negate the frame
and thus espouse literality.
<p>
<a name="FOOT44" href="#REF44">44</a>.
Part of the confusion here is that Lewis's term of
attack&#8212;"Modernist"&#8212;is the same term Fried uses to defend
art. Of course, Lewis could not have known the Minimalist art of the 1960s
that Fried was responding to, nor did Lewis ever formulate his theory
in Fried's condensed terms. Moreover, the Minimalist "new esthetic"
Fried discredits was, for Lewis, already rearing its head in early
twentieth-century modernism, while the particular objects of Lewis's
polemic do not concern Fried.

situations in which unorthodox action and the structure of time form
the work" (Marcoci, <i>Tempo</i>, 7). See also Erwin Wurm, <i>One Minute

"In view of the phenomena to be dealt with, and also because of the now
evident tendencies to think in terms of 'type,' it is possible that the
conception of type, types of man, physical and psychological types of
men, will, among thoughtful people, largely supplant the now prevalent
notion of races. However this may be, suffice it here to repeat that
race is a confused and uncertain subject."

<p>
When Toomer wrote these words in 1929, six years had passed since his
immersion in African American rural culture and the publication of
<i>Cane</i>, the book that would eventually secure him a place in the
American canon.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
In the following year, 1930, Toomer would deny James Weldon Johnson
permission to include poems from <i>Cane</i> in the revised version
of the <i>Anthology of Negro Poetry</i>, as he was reluctant to be
associated with "all things which emphasize or tend to over-emphasize
racial or cultural divisions."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
After being hailed as one of the instigators and stellar prospects of
the Negro Renaissance&#8212;he was lauded as the "the very first artist
of the race. . . . a bright morning star of the race in literature"
by the influential critic William Stanley Braithwaite&#8212;Toomer's
disdain for racial essentialism, which characterized most of his career,
hardened into a principle of not being identified publicly as African
American by 1924.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
This decision was also influenced by his contact with the Armenian
mystic Georges Gurdjieff, a relationship which led to what many have
seen as Toomer's idealistic and millennial predictions about the end
of racial categorization in the western world&#8212;a type of

<b></b>

hazy thinking and bland transcendence of social actuality and social
organization which has incurred much criticism. Indeed, critics have
often made a link between a downward trajectory in his career and his
refusal to accept an African American identity; Robert Brinkmeyer Jr. is
merely more outspoken than most in remarking that "without the touch of
the black soul, Jean Toomer was not an artist but a scribbler."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Yet this dismissal of his later thinking can obscure its continuities
with the <i>Cane</i> period, and particularly the subtlety of some
of the ways in which Toomer engaged with mass cultural discourses
as a way of disturbing normative practices of racialization. As the
quotation at the start of this essay implies, Toomer was not so much
interested in eliminating all social categorizations and distinctions,
as in reconring them in accordance with new ideas about what
constituted "identity." "Types," whether considered physiologically or
psychologically, might come to replace "races," or so he hoped; and in
doing so the rigidly deterministic attitude towards race in the America
of the 1920s might become avoidable, or even irrelevant. It is Toomer's
engagement with the discourse of physical culture, its implications for
racial politics in the 1920s, and how this is explored in <i>Cane</i>
that I shall examine&#8212;and how seeing bodies as "types" might begin
to disrupt or dislodge racial encodings of the body.
<p>
In his late 1920s autobiography "Earth Being," Toomer attested that
"I would far rather form a man than form a book."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
For much of his life Toomer, who classified his heredity as containing
"Scotch, Welsh, German, English, French, Dutch, Spanish [strains], with
some dark blood," was interested in the possibilities of developing his
sense of self, something that almost all biographical portraits of him
have noted (<i>WAS</i>, 92).
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
This took various forms, and was usually under the aegis of a particular
philosophical, technical or spiritual system; it applied to his intense
involvement with the regimen of physical culture exercises which he
undertook in the early 1910s, his ambition to be first a musician and
then a writer during the early 1920s, his involvement with Gurdjieffian
philosophy from 1924 onwards, his social experiment in communal living
at Portage in 1931, and his interest in the Alexander technique in the
1940s. Each of these was initially characterized by Toomer's extreme
enthusiasm and remarkably energetic application, an enthusiasm akin to
what he jokingly later referred to as a "neophyte on the threshold of
a new world."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
These "neophytisms" represented a belief in a capacity to reshape and
reform his subjectivity, a view which takes subjectivity as a version of
aesthetic formalism, something to be shaped and revised in relation to an
ideal; as he said, "my whole being is devoted to making my small area of
existence a work of art" (<i>WAS</i>, 19). Such statements attest to the
strength of Toomer's belief that a process of continual self-creation,
which he termed "individualization," was the most significant personal,
social or political concept imaginable. What they also suggest, however,
is that new discourses of physiology were emerging (and specifically
for the purposes of this essay, the discourse of physical culture)
which had a significant role in the gender formations of modernity,
and that such discourses often offered their consumers a particular
agency over the constitution of their identity. Put in simpler terms,
physical culture promised its customers that building the body built the
man. Yet evading biological determinism in this way by taking oneself
"in hand," as Toomer remarked

<b></b>

on beginning his physical culture regime, becomes much more subversive
when the built body troubles the biological determinations which were
believed to be specifically racial. It is this which the essay proposes
to investigate, through looking at Toomer's involvement with the physical
culture phenomenon, the bodybuilding "craze" which America underwent in
the early twentieth century.
<p>
As the historian Harold B. Sergel has commented, the late nineteenth
century and the early twentieth century were characterized by the
beginning of the "extraordinary modernist preoccupation with physicality."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
The physical culture movement that swept across Europe and America
in the latter years of the nineteenth century, making millionaires
and celebrities of res like Bernarr Macfadden and Eugene Sandow,
was just part of the "sports craze" which saw unprecedented levels of
participation and organization in a variety of sports across the U.S.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
The precursor to modern body-building, the physical culture movement made
millions of dollars by publishing techniques for developing muscular
physiques in magazines such as Macfadden's <i>Physical Culture</i>,
which he began publishing in 1899. This was a magazine that prescribed
health in terms of a disciplined attitude to diet, exercise, sex, work
and leisure, and enjoyed a circulation of 550,000 just over a year
after it was first published.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
Macfadden himself was a self-made success in the Horatio Alger mould. Born
in Missouri in 1868, he had an upbringing beset with family instability,
poverty and illness, which he counteracted through obsessive attention
to his health, fitness, diet, and the development of a complete system of
complementary medicine and exercise. In 1893 he attended the World's Fair
in Chicago, and marveled at the classical sculptures, which he described
as "perfect specimens of human life carried out in stone" (<i>WIAC</i>,
17). While at the fair, he met Florenz Ziegfeld, who was there promoting
Eugene Sandow. As Robert Ernst discusses, "Ziegfeld's lighting effects,
which accentuated the German strongman's muscles in the contrast of
highlights and black shadows, fascinated young McFadden, who donned tights
and began imitating Sandow's poses as Hercules, Atlas, Ajax, and Samson"
(<i>WIAC</i>, 17). After a while Macfadden moved to New York, re-named
himself Bernarr as a more masculine moniker than his original name of
Bernard, and opened a physical culture studio. He founded his publishing
company in 1898, which was the beginning of his phenomenal success, and
would produce many titles over the course of his career; these included
<i>Making Old Bodies Young: 38 Lessons in Building Vitality</i> ;
<i>Marriage a Lifelong Honeymoon</i> ; <i>The Virile Powers of
Superb Manhood</i> ; <i>The Power and Beauty of Superb Womanhood</i>
; <i>Physical Culture for Baby</i> ; <i>How to Gain Weight</i>
; <i>How to Lose Weight</i> ; and <i>Exercise and Like it</i>
.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The success of these books, <i>Physical Culture</i> magazine, and
especially his confessional magazine <i>True Story</i>, resulted in his
fortune totaling $30 million by 1931. Macfadden's career was marked by
incredible entrepreneurial energy, total belief in his own carefully
developed systems of holistic health, and a humorless inflexibility which
led him to extreme views on certain social and political matters. All
of these factors bear striking resemblance to the career of Toomer.

<b></b>

<p>
Macfadden's success, however, was reliant on broader social forces. The
physical culture craze was to a large degree dependent on representations
of idealized physiques, which were becoming more important to social
ideals of gender identity, and to the very practice of gender formation,
by the end of the nineteenth century. <i>Physical Culture</i>, for
example, sold mainly to men and was replete with half-tone pictures of
naked or semi-naked men in classical poses, demonstrating the evidence
of a "built" physique&#8212;photographs often bearing little relation
to the articles surrounding them (<i>WIAC</i>, 40). As Macfadden said,
"for health to be known, it must be seen."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Such a visual element to what was in effect conduct literature for
young men reflects a point made by gender historian Michael Kimmel,
who notes a profound shift in the constitution of masculine identities
underway at around this time. He notes that "the ideal of the Self-Made
Man gradually assumed physical connotations so that by the 1870s the
idea of 'inner strength' was replaced by a doctrine of physicality and
the body" (<i>MIA</i>, 120).
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
As previously valued characteristics such as competitiveness in the
marketplace, individualism, economic autonomy, or artisanal skill
became less significant in an economy consisting more and more of large
corporations and mass production, traditional arenas for men to affirm
their masculinity were disappearing.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The long tradition in American constructions of masculinity of
valuing the process of "self-making" was therefore transfering at this
point to the making of the body rather than of the character or the
privately-owned business, a shift which of course gave a more material
basis for definitions of masculinity than the previous generation had
experienced. As Kimmel goes on to discuss, this more materialized,
externalized locus for gender identity required constant performance;
whereas the older notion of "manhood" was "an expression of inner
character," the newer and more physically determined notion of
"masculinity" was "in constant need of validation, of demonstration,
of proof."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Such a premium on performance and exteriority resulted in a masculinity
wherein "the body did not <i>contain</i> the man, expressing the man
within; now, that body <i>was</i> the man (<i>MIA</i>, 120)."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
This development provided the basis for the economic success of the
discourse of physical culture, which operated in several ways. As
Ann Fabian has noted of both <i>Physical Culture</i>and Macfadden's
other great success, the confessional magazine <i>True Story</i>, his
"great innovation was to offer his readers a hand in the production of
the artefacts they so happily consumed, to urge them at every turn to
become writers as well as readers, producers as well as consumers."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<i>Physical Culture</i> generated a consumer desire in the space between
a consumer's self-perception and the visual presentation of idealized
physiques&#8212;the space between the real, and representations that
claimed the authority of an "ideal." Yet this desire was enabled by
the possibility of closing that gap through active participation,
through putting into practice its commodified disciplinary knowledge
and products. As Macfadden said in his early book <i>Muscular Power
and Beauty</i>, "Power and beauty are not for the favoured few; they
may become the property of any man in normal health who thinks their
possession worth an expenditure of effort."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Physical culture promised the ever-alluring paradox of both conformity
to a peer group and individual agency; the double attraction of a fixed
formal ideal and the ability for self-determination.

<b></b>

<p>
Frequently, Macfadden's ideal male subject was himself, and photographs
of him regularly appeared in his books and magazines. This helped
to consolidate three things: his authority as a health expert on
a range of subjects, his public persona as the literal embodiment
of physical culture, and his vision of what the male body should
look like. Indeed, as Fabian notes, this meant that "in his physical
schemes, a self was a series of poses" ("MACOT," 58). [<a name="1"
HREF="10.4whalan_res.html#1"> 1</a>] That subjectivity
could become contingent on such a schematic sequence of representations
allowed enormous freedom to the readers of <i>Physical Culture</i>,
as I shall go on to examine with Jean Toomer, not least in the play of
desires which such poses instituted. Macfadden's poses could provoke
the desire to identify, the desire to emulate, the desire to consume,
and erotic desire. Such polysemy and proliferation of desires resulted
from the fact that the space left open for readerly intervention in
the constitution of the identity of the represented body was so vast;
and this undoubtedly greatly extended the market appeal of <i>Physical
Culture</i>. However, this could lead to readings then deemed socially
unacceptable. As well as Toomer's questions about how race could possibly
be obfuscated through such a reliance on the pose in the constitution
of identity, which I will discuss later, the homoerotic overtones of
naked and semi-naked men in a mass market magazine was too much for
some contemporary custodians of public morality. Both Anthony Comstock,
secretary for the Society for the Suppression of Vice, and the postal
authorities brought obscenity actions against Macfadden's publications
and public shows, and Macfadden eventually required a presidential pardon
to avoid a jail term for these offences.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Such protests were not just concerned with Macfadden's sexual
objectification of the body in photographs, but also with the frank
advice he offered about sex. His 1916 book <i>Manhood and Marriage</i> is
a fairly typical example of how the physical culture movement discussed
masculinity, and demonstrates how central the generation of anxiety was
to its commercial success. The opening chapter&#8212;"The Importance
of Virility"&#8212;asks readers to pose themselves the question "Am
I a complete man?" and continues "when this query cannot be answered
satisfactorily, when you feel that there is a doubt as to the possession
of the qualities essential to true manhood, then indeed is your position
difficult."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Yet "true manhood," he suggested, could be obtained and retained
through an adherence to the "laws that govern the retention of manly
powers" (<i>MAM</i>, 1), laws which he spends the remainder of the
book outlining.
<p>
Perhaps the most pernicious threat to normative masculinity, according
to Macfadden, was masturbation, which Foucault has identified as one of
the key discourses by which "power advanced, [and] multiplied its relays
and effects" over children's bodies.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Macfadden cited evidence that the practice of masturbation was almost
"universal" in male youth, and opines that it is the most likely cause
of a boy's emasculation; so disturbing is it that by far the longest
chapter in <i>Manhood and Marriage</i> is entitled "The Truth About
Masturbation." Emasculation or feminization thus becomes the ultimate
"scare" tactic underlying Macfadden's exhortations against "deviation";
"to be a male and not a man, to wear the clothes indicative of the
male sex and realize that you are masquerading&#8212;a hypocrite, a
pretender&#8212;is indeed a tortuous experience" (<i>MAM</i>, 8). Indeed,
masturbation entails an emasculation that is both a degeneration and
a destruction of the normal male body; comparing it to castration,

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 603]</b>

Macfadden claimed itresulted in the "slow undermining of manhood and
all that goes with it" (<i>MAM</i>, 160).
<p>
Such sorry predictions about the effects of masturbation were indebted
to Macfadden's holistic, and fundamentally economic, notion of health,
which understood illness as the result of either too much (or the wrong
type of) consumption, or excessive wastage. So incredulous was he about
germ theory that he argued vociferously against vaccination programmes for
most of his career, and once bet that he could eat all the bacilli that
anyone might care to send to him without suffering any adverse effects
(<i>WIAC</i>, 21). Fasting was one of his favorite cures for illness, and
it was this model of the reliance of health on the balance between intake
and expenditure that led him to see semen in economic terms, as had many
sexologists of the nineteenth century (<i>MIA</i>, 128-9). The wastage
of semen in masturbation was the wastage of man's essential energies;
as he stated in <i>Manhood and Marriage</i>, one of the key questions men
should ask in determining whether they could call themselves a "complete
man" was "have I wasted my vitality and vigor?" (<i>MAM</i>, 10). Indeed,
seminal economy was equivalent to male self-preservation, and gains an
almost mythical status in some of his writing; he waxed that "the seminal
fluid is the most precious and concentrated secretion of the human body,
some students holding that one part is equal to many parts of pure blood."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Only a strict regimen of physical discipline and regulation, including
exercises, diet and willpower techniques, could counteract the
degeneration and general physical wastage associated with masturbation,
which Macfadden typified as producing spots, memory loss, a pale
complexion, and a "lagging gait" (<i>MAM</i>, 162).
<p>
This was the context in which Toomer encountered Macfadden's journal
<i>Physical Culture</i>. As an adolescent he had entered a period
of what he called "sex indulgences" which he described as "the most
desperate struggles of my life." Due to the medical discourse surrounding
masturbation, he believed it had been the cause of a long and unpleasant
childhood illness, and saw it as a "practice which more than any other
bleeds away the body and soul. . ." (<i>WAS</i>, 50-1).As a recourse from
what he felt to be this debilitating habit (and in an unfortunate turn
of phrase) he "took myself in hand" by buying Macfadden's five-volume
<i>Encyclopedia of Physical Culture</i>, and entering a program of
physical discipline (<i>WAS</i>, 89):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I went in for physical training. I regularly took exercises at
home. I took several correspondence courses in muscle-building
and health promotion. Dumbbells, wrestling. Finally, I began heavy
weightlifting. . . . I tried dieting and nature cure. I ran across the
Physical Culture magazine and was thus introduced to Bernarr Macfadden. I
bought his encyclopedia, and, in addition to following his prescriptions,
I began talking and arguing his ideas with everyone. . . . No-one knew the
t I was making. But, in time, everyone saw the results. They came to
regard me as an exceptionally strong and healthy young man. (<i>WAS</i>,
89-90)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
During this period he observed the dietary restrictions advised by the
journal; installed gym apparatus along the walls of his room, and bought
a set of lung testing

<b></b>

equipment which he "blew into . . . until [his] lung capacity became
the marvel of experts." He took the "Farmer Burns correspondence course
in wrestling" and "got some fellows to come to my room to work on"
(<i>BX2</i>, 62). He also kept scrapbooks containing pictures of Greek
statues and men in body-building poses, and this developed in him a sense
of the aesthetics of the human body; through these activities and images
he found himself "stepping beyond self-interests, with something of the
artist's sensibility" and beginning "to respond to the human re as
nature's most amazing work of art" (<i>BX2</i>, 63).
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
This was the first instance of many in Toomer's life where formalized
training of the body offered the promise of a radical change in
subjectivity. Physical Culture offered him an artistic agency over
his identity; it also promised to eradicate the visible signs of the
"abnormality" and "indiscipline" of masturbation, bringing Toomer in
line with the "normality" of white, middle class American male values
that Macfadden both interpreted so astutely and helped to form.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
As Toomer noted: "The desire for body improvement is the physical
division of the desire for self-improvement; and the desire for
self-improvement is, I judge, on a par with the desire for survival
as one of the basic motivations of man's life. This primary desire,
as particularised in me at that time, chanced upon the Physical Culture
magazine" (<i>BX2</i>, 61). Yet equally significantly to the achievement
of a state of "normality," "self-improvement" through physical culture
seemed to offer an identity that was inmany ways devoid of history,
the chance of a reformation into a "strong and healthy young man" and
the banishment of a history of weakness and "indulgences." Indeed, this
motivation to re-invent oneself and erase an undesirable personal history
was one of the reasons behind Jay Gatsby's involvement with physical
culture in <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. Fabian's quote that Macfadden reduced
the self to a "series of poses" recalls Nick Carraway's observation that
"personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures"; in this
way the historical precedent of the pose colonizes the body itself,
erasing its histories, its particularities, and its secrets.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Recreating the body as a method of recreating one's identity, building
up as a way of building over, continued to appeal to Toomer, even after
his "neophytism" with physical culture. In the years following this
he studied as a gym instructor at the American College of Physical
Training in Chicago (attracted partly by the fact that it used to be
directed by Macfadden), dabbled with the Alexander technique (a technique
which advocates specific muscular training and "conscious control" of
involuntary muscular activity as a method towards holistic health), and
became deeply involved with the ideas of G. I. Gurdjieff after seeing
a program of dance at his exhibition in New York. Toomer was moved by
these dances, feeling that they "seemed to take hold of the body and
literally re-create it. . . . They involved the whole man, I felt sure,
and were means in the service of an essentially religious aim."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Such was Toomer's early involvement with the discourse of physical
culture and its promise of corporeal transformability, an involvement
so significant that he played out his enthusiasm for it in various but
similar body disciplines throughout his life. Yet there was another
element to this discourse which Toomer's "first neophytism" did not
make reference to, yet which was evident a few years later in society at
large, and which he would bring to bear on the writing of <i>Cane</i>. As
already mentioned, physical

<b></b>

culture's linkage of masculinity with agency&#8212;one could
<i>choose</i>whether to be a man or not&#8212;and the strand of it
which promises a liberation from inherited physical limitations is
a function of changing definitions of maleness, in which masculinity
has to be repeatedly <i>proved</i>. Yet the correlative of a system of
masculinity which required continual proof was that an identity based
more on display did not require a narrative of origins to validate it;
indeed, the nature of the posed, well-built body was that the pose itself
came to define the body, a representational phenomenon which banished the
history and the specificity of the body which inhabited the pose. Roland
Barthes has written of this in his discussions of photography:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I lend myself to the social game, I pose, I know I am posing, I want
you to know I am posing, but (to square the circle) this additional
message must in no way alter the precious essence of my individuality:
what I am, apart from any ef. What I want, in short, is that my
(mobile) image, buffeted along with a thousand shifting photographs,
altering with situation and age, should always coincide with my "profound"
self; but it is the contrary that must be said: "myself" never coincides
with my image, for it is the image which is heavy, motionless, stubborn
(which is why society sustains it), and "myself" which is light, divided,
dispersed. . . .
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Barthes, here, sees the pose as a cumbersome and inflexible
representational imposition on his "profound" self; but for marginalized
racial groups who lived with such cumbersome and inflexible associations
applied to them by white American society, adopting the "poses" of
idealized masculinity could have precisely the opposite effect. Ideas
taken from the physical culture movement (aimed at a white, male, middle
class readership) take on a very different status when appropriated
by racial groups whose bodies had been overdetermined by white racist
discourse, and this applied especially to African Americans. In this
respect it is interesting to look at the photograph in <a name="2"
HREF="10.4whalan_res.html#2">re 2</a>, of Toomer at
college [possibly in Chicago]. Stripped to the waist to reveal his built
physique, Toomer's arms are crossed in a pose to show off the size and the
resolution of his biceps and shoulders; he is shot from below to emphasize
his height and authority, factors also enhanced by the small window frame
behind him. In looking to the left of the camera and avoiding the lens
he stresses his autonomy, self-reliance and even arrogance. As Richard
Dyer has noted of the connections between "whiteness" and bodybuilding,
the appearance of the built body has connotations which have often been
central to white male identity, and which white masculinities have often
hoarded for themselves. These include the display of a hard, taut body
surface which provides "a sense of separation and boundedness," one which
re-enforces the impossibility of being "merged" with racial or gendered
others; it also represents "the literal triumph of mind over matter,
imagination over flesh."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
As he goes on, "the point after all is that it is built, a product of
the application of thought and planning, and achievement. It is the
sense of the mind at work behind the production of this body that most
defines its whiteness."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Yet in the photo of Toomer we see the proud affirmation of autonomy
and "separateness," and the confidence borne of flesh that has been
subjugated to the imagination. If these ideas, as Dyer suggests, are
inherently racialized, what effect is

<b></b>

generated by their appropriation by a man who at the census definitions
of the time would have been classed a Negro?
<p>
On a broader scale, the ramifications of the idea that training was
productive of a masculinity which could claim an authority similar to
that which the white middle

<b></b>

class had attempted to reserve as exclusively theirs was evident in
responses to black soldiers joining up for the war in Europe in 1917. As
Charles B. Johnson, an African American soldier from Georgia who fought
in the war, pointed out in his <i>The World War and Democracy as Regards
the Negro: The Truth</i>:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There is nothing superior to military training in the development of
healthy and robust bodies. Many American boys entered the army in poor
health, and returned home strong, healthy men. The military discipline
makes not only the soldier and citizen of the boy, but also a physical
giant. Life in the army is calculated to develop all the power of a
man. Sanitation and the scientific care of the man cannot be surpassed
in the army. What can be done for the soldier boy in war should be done
for the citizen boy in time of peace.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, Johnson's vision of physical training as producing a
new and more powerful black masculinity was something that many white
men found alarming.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
New technologies of the body provided by the physical culture movement
and the training of large numbers of black soldiers became liberatory
technologies for black men, allowing opportunities for a self-made
physical identity different from the ways their bodies had entered into
relations of power and representation in previous times. These phenomena
are evident in <i>Cane</i>'s suggestion that a more formalized, aesthetic
view of identity might provide greater social liberty, especially when
applied to African American male subjectivities.
<p>
Toomer's emerging view contradicted the neo-Darwinian opinion that race
and identity were inseparably linked, an opinion which frequently shaded
into a white supremacist belief that "hard" heredity legitimated the
segregation and unequal treatment of races.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
He also avoided easy dualisms between body and spirit characteristic
of nineteenth-century constructions of masculinity. In 1924, Toomer
commented that "[c]oncern with race is one of the main factors
causing American materialism, interest solely in the physical aspects
of existence. Our materialism, on the other hand, is one of the main
factors causing concern with race. For both of these conditions emphasise
the body&#8212;falsely&#8212;and false body values."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
In his view, the body's materiality was largely contingent upon the
discursive frameworks within which it was produced; it was material
capable of being changed&#8212;and changing in return the very nature
of individual subjectivity of which it formed a part. What was needed
was a dynamic process in order to effect this change, which Toomer had
sought in physical culture, the Alexander technique, and Gurdjieffian
systematics of the body. It was this that Toomer hoped would be one
of the features of the Harlem Renaissance; in his essay "The Negro
Emergent" he exulted that "the Negro" was now "discovering his body,"
and putting it into the service of "his own experience."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Toomer's thought here anticipates Judith Butler's recent examination
of the ways in which the material body comes into cognitive being. She
notes that, "psychic projection confers boundaries and, hence, unity on
the body, so that the very contours of the body are sites that vacillate
between the psychic and the material. Bodily contours and morphology
are not merely implicated in an irreducible tension between the psychic
and the material but <i>are</i> that tension.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Toomer had exulted following his involvement with physical culture
that "I had built up a certain strength of will over my body. I could
<i>make</i> it do things. The bodies of the other boys simply moved of
themselves." [Toomer's emphasis].
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Making and "making it do" come to be identical in this conception of
the body, and the dynamic, disciplinary process of physical culture,
as well as its reliance on the pose, comes to shift the point of
tension which Butler describes above to allow for new parameters of
the morphological imaginary. It would be wrong to claim that Toomer
had no faith in a materiality that existed outside language and outside
discourse, a proposition at the center of Butler's argument; yet he was
aware of the way in which discursive practices, in interaction with the
material, produced bodily morphologies. In <i>Cane</i> Toomer examined
several dynamic processes which offered re-imaginations of the body,
in an effort to examine the "materiality" of race.
<p>
One of those processes is Toomer's return, in his fiction, to
the discourse of physical culture. This return takes the form of a
reworking of his time at the American College of Physical Training in
<i>Cane</i>'s short story "Bona and Paul." The college had adopted its
name in 1913; it had originally been founded by Macfadden, and this
was one of the major reasons why Toomer was attracted to study there
as a gym instructor. Toomer's enthusiasm for physical culture was
largely responsible for his decision to enrol there in 1916, and he
later remembered this time as one of physical fitness and exuberance,
gaiety, sexual freedom and intellectual exploration. As he described it
nineteen years later, a kind of obsession with the corporeal created a
communal atmosphere that smoothed over social and racial divisions:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
To be in good condition, which meant good physical condition, to improve
one's physique&#8212;this was the ruling idea and desire amongst the
men. It was a cult of body. We talked body and muscles and diet. We
talked physical measurements more than personalities. We analysed
exercises more than motives. It was a simple world, an immediate life,
realistic and articulate with reference to the physical aspects of man,
relatively unspoken as regards man's other aspects and problems. A
person suffering from the burdens and diseases of the complex modern
world would have forgotten them and been cured in our midst (<i>BX2</i>).
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The Macfaddenesque pose&#8212;the physique and the exercise&#8212;came
to be more significant in the constitution of social identity than the
personality, the motives, or by implication the origin of Toomer and
his fellow students. It was this kind of liberation from biological
determinism, or perhaps what I will call "racial legibility," that
Toomer included in "Bona and Paul." The pose, in preceding the body
and in effect taking over the body, overwrites the racial markings of
the body and in some circumstances makes it racially "illegible." This,
of course, was anathema to racist popular scientists of the time such
as Madison Grant, whose widely read text <i>The Passing of the Great
Race</i>  presented a case for racial and ethnic segregation based
on a belief in irreconcilable biological difference between races. He
posited that racial purity was vital for national survival, and warned
that "the result of the mixture of two races, in the long

<b></b>

run, gives us a race reverting to the more ancient, generalised and
lower type."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
The social and political significance that this kind of discourse
placed on race required a correspondingly exact taxonomy of races, and a
schema of how this taxonomy could be visually recognized. Accordingly,
Grant pursues a somatic classification of race with a lengthy list of
anthropomorphic criteria to differentiate races, including height, hair
and eye color, and the "cephalic index"&#8212;the correlation between
the length and width of the skull (<i>POTGR</i>, 1). What this provides
is an interpretative schema for reading the body, and led to Grant's
imagination of a future "utopian" science which could provide an exact
correlation between visual markings and racial identity: " . . . every
generation of human beings carries the blood of thousands of ancestors,
stretching back through thousands of years. . . . the face and body of
every living man offer an intricate mass of hieroglyphs that science
will someday learn to read and interpret" (<i>POTGR</i>, 35).
<p>
It was the disruption of such a fundamental link between physiology and
race that <i>Cane</i> examined, particularly with its interest in the
disruption of racial legibility in "Bona and Paul." In the story, which
is the final text piece in <i>Cane</i>'s second, non-rural section (the
remainder of the text pieces in this section are set in Toomer's native
Washington), it is precisely Paul's racial illegibility&#8212;a difference
which is visible but unnamable&#8212;that makes hima center of both
curiosity and desire. Art, his white Norwegian roommate, thinks "Queer
about him. I could stick up for him if he'd only come out, one way or the
other, and tell a feller"; when they enter the Crimson Gardens cabaret,
the other students there "leaned towards each other over ash-smeared
tablecloths and highballs and whispered: What is he, a Spaniard, an
Indian, an Italian, a Mexican, a Hindu, or a Japanese?" (<i>C</i>, 76,
77). The word "queer" is used again shortly afterwards as Paul considers
the difference between himself and the southern, white Bona: "From the
South. What does that mean, precisely, except that you'll love or hate
a nigger? Thats a lot. What does it mean except that in Chicago you'll
have the courage to neither love or hate. A priori. But it would seem
that you have. Queer words, arent these, for a man who wears blue pants
on a gym floor in the daytime" (<i>C</i>, 77-8).
<p>
Pertinent here is Judith Butler's discussion of the "queer" in Nella
Larsen's <i>Passing</i> . She notes that during the Harlem
Renaissance



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"queer" did not yet mean homosexual, but it did encompass an array of
meanings associated with the deviation from normalcy which might well
include the sexual. Its meanings include: of obscure origin, the state
of feeling ill or bad, not straight, perverse, obscure, eccentric. As a
verb-form, "to queer" has a history of meaning: to quiz or ridicule, but
also to swindle and to cheat. . . . [and "queering" can be] what upsets
and exposes passing; it is the act by which the racially and sexually
repressive surface of conversation is exploded, by rage, by sexuality,
by the insistence on color (<i>BTM</i>, 177).
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul's "queerness" involves many of these factors, which coalesce around
the questions his body provokes but refuses to answer. He also represents
a disturbing "deviation from normalcy," as his physical, and specifically
sexual, presence seemingly coexists with his racial absence. As Siobhan
Somerville has discussed in her chapter on the

<b></b>

frequent use of the phrase "queer" in Toomer's writing, "the vocabulary
of 'queer' emerged in Toomer's texts as a way to mark res who
disrupted or scrambled the boundary logics of race and gender, res
who indirectly included Toomer himself (<i>QTCL</i>, 139-40)."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Indeed, this disruption of racial boundaries is obvious in the
substitution of geography for race illustrated in the quotation about
the students given above. The students (unsuccessfully) engage in
a geographical scramble to try and "place" Paul, to ascribe him a
spatial fixity&#8212;an endeavor which testifies to the anxiety his
racial ambiguity causes them. Such ambiguity allows Paul an access
to all spaces; from the "unpainted cabins" of black Georgia to the
Crimson Gardens cabaret of Chicago, a club that Barbara Foley has argued
operates a policy of segregation and thus is representative of new Jim
Crow codes being instituted in public facilities at the time.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Most challenging of all to white hegemony, however, is that his ambiguity
allows him access to the space of Bona's body. Bona is attracted to this
ambiguity, which does not carry the prohibition of definite knowledge
and the accompanying social censure, yet retains the attractiveness of
difference; "He is an autumn leaf. He is a nigger. Bona! But dont all the
dorm girls say so? And dont you, when you are sane, say so? That's why
I love&#8212;Oh, nonsense. You never loved a man who didn't first love
you" (<i>C</i>, 72). Paul's perversity&#8212;since he has no "place"
he is always out of place&#8212;makes him the most disturbing re
to white racist discourse in <i>Cane</i>, not merely transgressing
boundaries but interrogating the very efficacy of those boundaries,
founded as they are on a belief in racially legible bodies.
<p>
Yet it is his trained body, schooled in the physical education class that
begins the story, which provides at least some of this ambiguity. As the
story opens, Bona is watching the "young men and women . . . drilling" on
the "school gymnasium floor"; and "the dance of [Paul's] blue-trousered
limbs thrills her" (<i>C</i>, 72). It is precisely the formal structure
of bodily movement of the dance or the drill, rather than the racial
identity of Paul's body itself, which allows her this space of erotic
fantasy; as the "pose" takes precedence over the "hieroglyphs," Bona's
southern inhibitions about miscegenation are allayed. At this point
it is worth drawing upon Linda Mart&iacute;n Alcoff's essay "Towards a
Phenomenology of Racial Embodiment," which discusses the way in which
racialization is a learned visual perceptual practice, one that becomes
"organised, like bodily movements used to perform various operations,
into integrated units that become habitual."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Alcoff argues that this "habitual" nature of racialized perceptual
practice makes it very hard to analyze critically, and especially
to change, but she does see this as possible; she continues that
"perceptual practices are dynamic even when congealed into habit,
and that dynamism can be activated by the existence of multiple forms
of the gaze in various cultural productions and by the challenge of
contradictory perceptions."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
It is exactly the "contradictory perception" of the drilled and posed
body of Paul which disturbs Bona's habitual perceptual practice of
racialization, and opens the space for her erotic fantasy.
<p>
Such operations are made even more evident later in the story, as Paul
considers the nature of Bona's affection for him. The binary choice of
normative American racial politics, i.e., whether to "love or hate a
nigger," he considers "Queer words . . . for a

<b></b>

man who wears blue pants on a gym floor in the daytime" (<i>C</i>,
77-8). Physical culture enables Paul to elide some of the either/or
determinations of racial identity to be found in American society; it
promised a selective erasure of history and heredity, two of the factors
which white discourse had used to assign black bodies a hierarchical
place. The confusion this causes Bona is obvious. Calling Paul "cold,"
Bona thinks to herself "colored; cold. Something wrong somewhere"
(<i>C</i>, 76); his calm, focused and laconic character&#8212;linked to
his program of physical discipline&#8212;calls into question either the
validity of racial markers such as exuberant emotion and shiftlessness
that were connected to blackness, or Paul's racial status as black. Either
way, Paul's body becomes somehow "wrong" and unsettling to Bona,
but specifying&#8212;assigning Paul a geographical or hierarchical
location&#8212;is not possible. Indeed, Bona's vague allocation of
"something . . . somewhere" illustrates the confusion that conflicting
signals in the visibility of Paul's corporal schema have caused her, and
ultimately how unstable the habitual methods of corporeal schematization
in a racialized and gendered society can be.
<p>
Later in the story, Art's girlfriend Helen thinks about Paul, "whom the
whole dormitory calls a nigger," and decides that "men like him (Paul)
can fascinate. One is not responsible for fascination" (<i>C</i>, 78). To
fascinate, of course, means to cast a spell over, to mesmerize, as well
as to compel attention. Indeed, it is this combination of the increased
scrutiny that Paul is subjected to, and the mesmerizing suspension of a
"normal" ability to perceive on the part of his scrutineers, which makes
his character so important to <i>Cane</i>. Paul's engagement with physical
culture as a method of effecting this combination also represents a
particularly audacious form of appropriation, as Macfadden was committed
to a politics of white supremacy and was at one time attracted to
"Mussolini and the Fascist reconstruction of Italian manhood and athletic
performance" ("MACOT," 55). Paul's identity&#8212;which eludes spatial
and racial fixity, and therefore enables his access to a multiplicity
of people, locations and traditions&#8212;indicates some of the broader
ambitions of the text of <i>Cane</i>. These were ambitions to see racial
divisions and polarities&#8212;in readerships, in generic structures,
and in identities&#8212;questioned and perhaps even threatened by such
experimental work. These ambitions were also evident in the ways Toomer
imagined contemporary technology could impact upon norms of racialized
perception, strategies which I have examined elsewhere.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
Despite these subtle and innovative ways of resisting the "learned visual
perceptual practices" of racialization, however, it is undeniable that
this could only be efficacious in situations where what Grant termed the
"hieroglyphs" which coded racial identity were ambiguous. This was as
true in Toomer's own case as it was for the "Autumn Leaf" complexion
of his character Paul. As Toomer stated, "At various times and in
varying places I have been taken for no less than the following. I
have been taken for an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Dutchman, a Cuban,
a South American, a Russian, a Japanese, an American Indian, a Hindoo,
an Egyptian, a Frenchman&#8212;all of which goes to prove, among other
things, that as my life is, so my looks are, untypically American."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
This situation was vital in allowing Toomer's desire for
"individualization," closely allied to "the desire for self-improvement"
which was so well served by his engagement

<b></b>

with physical culture, to become "on a par with the desire for survival
as one of the basic motivations of man's life" (<i>BX2</i>, 61). Yet
this situation of being on the limns of America's visual and social
categorizations of race effectively disinclined Toomer from enthusing
over any version of collective racial politics. As Toomer stated in 1935,
he was "not a collectivist in so far as this term means regimentation
and rule by herd psychology";and allocating a racial identity to a
person was "to [group] him with the herd, and, by implication, [deny]
him individuality."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Later in his career especially, Macfadden's model of ideal subjectivity
being the result of a well-managed <i>individual</i> economy, governed by
regulation of intake and expenditure, was closer to Toomer's political
views than any desire for collective action on the basis of class or
racial solidarity. As Robert B. Jones has noted, "using an idealized
version of himself as the foundation of a new, raceless social order,"
Toomer "consistently proposed idealism as the solution to racial and
social problems, yet without the praxis of social activism."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
However, Toomer's investigations into how such "individualization"
could take place against the backdrop of a society that had an ideology
of racial determinism so firmly at the center of its practices and
institutions are nonetheless worthy of attention. They demonstrate how
discourses of mass culture can become appropriated into practices which
are socially and politically subversive; they suggest the instability of
how race is visually constituted, and the power of the pose in overriding
such constitution; and they suggest ways in which the very American
struggle between "self-making" and determinism was being played out in
the early twentieth century. Physical culture presented Toomer with what
he called "a discipline which promised its followers not only a healthy
mind in a healthy body but a strong brilliant mind in the body of a
Hercules or an Apollo&#8212;you could take your choice." Such a belief
in the agency he had over his identity, and especially the transracial
possibilities of such a "discipline," should not be dismissed&#8212;as
Toomer does in his own words&#8212;as merely "the idiocies and excesses
of this, my first neophytism" (<i>BX2</i>, 62-5).

Quoted in J. Martin Favor, <i>Authentic Blackness: The Folk in the New
Negro Renaissance</i> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1999), 53. This
type of reaction was very common in assessments of Toomer during the
Black Arts movement. Important later assessments include Alice Walker's;
she saw <i>Cane</i> as the "parting gift" as Toomer said "good-bye to
the Negro he felt dying in himself," and believed most of <i>Cane</i>'s
contemporary readers would be disappointed with the moral choice Toomer

<b></b>

had made in choosing to "live his own life as a white man." See "The
Divided Life of Jean Toomer," <i>In Search of our Mothers' Gardens:
Womanist Prose</i> (London: The Women's Press, 1984), 62, 65. Perhaps the
most vehement critic of Toomer's approach, however, is Robert B. Jones;
he comments that Toomer's "Positing the self as the origination of a
new social and political order, on the basis of a privileged notion
of the self as having special mystical powers, is at best solipsistic,
at worst, fascistic. Such ahistorical millennialism does not consider
the collective as a catalyst for social change." <i>Jean Toomer and the

Other historians have concurred with this. Anthony E. Rotundo has remarked
on the "dramatic shift of masculine ideals in nineteenth-century America. . . from a standard of manhood rooted in the life of a community
and the qualities of a man's soul to a standard of manhood based on
individual achievement and the male body." See his "Body and Soul:
Changing Ideals of American Middle-Class Manhood, 1770-1920," <i>Journal
of Social History</i> 16 (Summer 1983), 23.

As Kimmel notes, four out of five American men were self-employed
in the early nineteenth century; by 1870, this re had dropped to
one in three. Richard Edwards comments that even as late as the 1880s,
firms with net assets of $10m or over were being classed as "very large"
in contemporary studies. This reflects the predominance of small-business
ownership; indeed, he remarks "the 'firm' as an entity separate from the
activities of the entrepreneur hardly existed." <i>Contested Terrain:

Such a shift in the locus of male identity is very similar to the
observation made by Warren I. Susman, that personality as a concept
and a term was becoming increasingly socially valued at the expense
of the notion of character in this period of American history. See his

Bernarr Macfadden, <i>Manhood and Marriage</i> (New York: Macfadden,

sexual urge as central to healthy masculinity, but believed that marriage
was the only suitable institution for the expression of sexuality. He
was also a keen supporter of eugenics, and commented that in the act of
"selecting a wife" men should "marry a woman, first, because you love
her; second, because you are convinced that she would be the mother of
strong, splendid children; and, third, because you admire and respect
her." In addition, he advised that "the eugenic considerations in marital
selection are not to be ignored" (<i>MAN ,</i> 30-2).

Hurley (London: Penguin, 1990), 42. Masturbation had been a cause of
concern for many years before this in medical discourse and conduct
manuals, concern which reached a particular intensity in the mid
1800s. This was tied to the "marketplace man" model of masculinity;
male sexual energy became regarded in economic terms, and masturbation
was seen as harmful due to the "waste" of "man's vital energies" that
it involved (Kimmel, "Consuming Manhood," 15-8).

For example, there was much debate over whether to train black officers
during the war; eventually a special training camp for black officers
was constructed at Des Moines, but to the outrage of black political
organizations the instructors were all white. Moreover, the achievements
of the black soldiers in France made several in authority uncomfortable; a
secret U.S. Army communiqu&eacute; to the French forces advised them "not
to commend too highly the American troops, particularly in the presence
of [white] Americans." Propaganda was distributed to French Troops,
entitled "Secret Information Concerning Black Troops," which warned of
the "dangers" of allowing black soldiers to associate freely with white
women; advising no social contact with black troops, it also explained
segregation as necessary to prevent rape. One white U.S. observer bewailed
that the training of black Americans into combat troops and officers was
"regarded by practically all regular Army officers as one of the greatest
mistakes ever made by the war department." Tensions over the stationing
of black troops had sparked race riots in 1917; and in the South there
were several cases of African American soldiers being lynched in their
uniforms upon their return from Europe, lynchings egged on by vicious
editorials in southern newspapers. See David Levering Lewis, <i>When
Harlem was in Vogue</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 13-14;
and also Arthur E. Barbeau and Florette Henri, <i>The Unknown Soldiers:

This "hard" view of heredity as the major determining factor in an
organism's characteristics was indebted to the theory of the "continuity
of germ plasm" advanced by August Weismann, and the recently revived work
of Gregor Mendel on heredity. This differed from the "soft" heredity
of Lamarck, which saw changes in organisms caused by the environment
as being inheritable. For further discussion of the difference between
these approaches, see Diane Paul, <i>Controlling Human Heredity: 1865
to the Present</i> (Atlantic Highlands: Humanities Press, 1995), chapter
3. For an excellent account of the connections between ideas of heredity,
eugenics, nativism, and the immigration restriction bills of the 1920s,

Butler proposes that <i>Passing</i> offers a way of starting to think
about how sexual difference intersects with racial difference: "What
requires radical rethinking is . . . what convergent set of historical
formations of racialized gender, of gendered race, of the sexualization
of racial ideals, or the racialization of gender norms, makes up
both the social regulation of sexuality and its psychic articulations"
(<i>BTM</i>, 182). Siobhan Somerville offers a slightly different version
of the meanings of the word "Queer" in New York society in the 1920s; see
