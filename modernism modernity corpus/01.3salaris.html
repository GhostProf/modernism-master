<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the period when Filippo Tommaso Marinetti brought to life his ambitious
project of artistic reawakening, mass society was still in an early
stage of development, far from having acquired the characteristics that
would subsequently become more and more clearly defined with the ever
more rapid development of new technologies. Yet it was precisely this
new world, just emerging at the dawn of the twentieth century, with its
profound economic and anthropological transformations, that became the
reference point for futurism, a movement that responded to the radical
nature of this epochal shift with a project almost equally global in
its ambitions, that committed itself to an aesthetic renovation also
entailing moral and intellectual claims, and that sought to involve not
just an intellectual elite, but all the classes and sectors of modern
society. Harking back in certain ways to the criteria of collective art
previously suggested by Wagner and Lautr&eacute;amont, Marinetti chose
to pursue a program of cultural democratization, setting himself the
goal of bringing art into the realm of daily life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The advent of mass society, as Benjamin noted long ago, entails the
"decay of the auratic,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 a process in which art loses its halo of associations with ritual and
 magic as the values of tradition disappear. His viewpoint might almost
 have been designed to illustrate a well-known prose-poem by Baudelaire,
 "Perte d'aur&eacute;ole" (lost halo), a witty sketch in which Baudelaire
 explores the new marginality assigned to the artist by the world of
 modernity. The protagonist, a poet, recounts his earlier attempt to
 cross a boulevard jammed with morning traffic. Trying to leap over the
 mud while also avoiding the horses and

<B></B>

carriages that fly in every direction, he had made a sudden movement that
caused his halo to fall into the mud. Stricken with panic and fearful of
being injured, he then decided to leave it on the ground. Yet he feels no
regret, he tells his interlocutor, for now he is free to stroll through
the city incognito, "like all common mortals." Now, the poet informs
his hearer, he is "an exact resemblance of yourself, as you can see!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Responding many years later to the same sense of the loss of the artist's
role in modernity, Marinetti attempted to relocate or rediscover the
sense of aura within the forms of modernity itself. Perhaps it is no
accident that he placed his own artistic rebirth in a muddy ditch as
well in the famous allegorical narrative that prefaces "The Founding
and First Manifesto of Futurism," in which an automobile accident is
represented as a second birth and myth of initiation to modern life:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Oh! Maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain! I
gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed black
breast of my Sudanese nurse....When I came up torn, filthy, and stinking
from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously
pass through my heart!
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage plainly indicates the necessity of descending into the
inferno of modern life, of accepting the challenges posed by an existence
dominated by speed, standardization, noise, and mass communications;
but that project, in turn, implicitly requires that it be translated
concretely into a program of recuperating, for the domain of art, the
universe of new signs that is offered by the metropolis, signs that can
be used for constructing a new epic, an industrial epos shaped by the
mythic language of the machine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That implicit program of recuperation is signalled not by the allegorical
narrative, but by the medium of its transmission and the relationship
of the narrative to the event that it heralds. Adopting a polemical
stance towards the communicative means of more traditional culture,
closed in upon itself and incapable of seeing beyond the institutional
limits imposed by academies, universities, readers' circles, and salons,
Marinetti understands the new world of mass communications and, decades
before Marshall McLuhan, intuitively perceives that "the medium is the
message." "The Founding and First Manifesto," published on the first
page <I>Le ro</I> (Paris) on 20 February 1909, embodies this very
understanding: it is launched from an international venue in a language
that addresses the widest possible audience. Moreover, it announces
a pseudo-event, the birth of Futurism; it is by means of the press
that this event is immediately realized. (In point of fact, Marinetti
possessed only a handful of followers at the time, all of them poets,
and it was not until much later that he would be joined by painters,
musicians, and architects, to form a genuinely global movement.) From
the beginning, in other words, Marinetti possessed an uncommon capacity
for using the media and forging public relations, gifts that he utilized
in a self-conscious effort to promote Futurism in much the way that one
would promote an industrial product that is to be introduced into the
market and publicized.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At least part of Marinetti's sensibility to advertising was a result of
his living in Milan, a city then in a stage of rapid economic growth. What
struck him in particular were two phenomena that were absolutely new
and that plainly accompanied the development of modern society: on
the one hand, industrialization, which, advancing in stages of sudden
expansion, dissolves the pyramidal structure of an older social order
in favor of massification, and on the other hand, the birth of popular
political parties and unionization. Both industry and politics possess
their own linguistic registers enabling them to enter dialogue with
a wide public, penetrating almost every level of society. Aiming at
creating an avant-garde that would address a mass society, Marinetti
introduced into the world of art precisely the kinds of communicative
systems that typified the political avant-garde (verbal violence,
techniques of agitation, meetings, etc.) and industrial advertising
(hypervaluation in the representation of its own products, a massive
use of posters, the launching of leaflets, etc.).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most interesting aspects of this program consisted in
the strategy adopted for the sale and diffusion of works of art and
books. Marinetti created a complex of entrepreneurial functions and
activities aimed at moving goods created by artist-producers to public
consumers, and so became the unquestioned manager of a vast program
of cultural marketing, responsible for coordinating and directing the
entire enterprise. His initiatives extended from publishing to organizing
theatrical tourn&eacute;es, from arranging propaganda expeditions in
various countries abroad, typically accompanied by lectures and readings,
to preparing exhibitions both abroad and in Italy. An impresario of
poets and painters, Marinetti would deploy his own economic resources in
financing these operations. His house (first in Milan, then in Rome after
1925 or so) was always the official seat, the corporate headquarters of
the movement, a mixture of house and museum in which Oriental furniture
(inherited from his father, Enrico, formerly a lawyer and businessman
in Alexandria, Egypt) was placed alongside the paintings, books, and
sculptures of the Futurists. Over the entrance door was a plaque with
the simple inscription, "Futurism."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is a commonplace to say that "publicity is the soul of commerce,"
but before Marinetti nobody had thought that advertising might be also
the soul, or <I>motor</I>, of art. Fifty years after the foundation
of Futurism, the poet Aldo Palazzeschi could still recall the sense of
shock that this produced among contemporaries.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Marinetti had understood from the beginning the power of advertising, a
power that would eventually accomplish feats and address people from the
highest to the lowest, omitting no one within the social structure...for
more orthodox thinkers, to use it for matters of intellectual and cultural
life was considered an ignominy so base that no dictionary was thought
to possess a term that could sufficiently describe its wickedness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among contemporary cultural circles, Marinetti was reproved for operating
in a style <I>all'americana</I> (in an American style) that was deemed
inappropriate to the world of art. Giuseppe Prezzolini, who was interested
in rhetoric and the arts of persuasion,
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 remarked that Marinetti had the "advertising personality of a good
 travelling salesman":

<B></B>

For him everything is of equal value, provided only that it happen to
come from his own firm. Extremely adept at launching new products, he
never wonders whether the goods that he is selling are fine or coarse:
for him, all of it is merchandise of the highest quality.

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the early years of Futurism, prior to the outbreak of the Great War,
Marinetti would cover the walls and hoardings of all the major cities of
Italy with massive white posters that contained a single word in glaring
red: "Futurism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most specific and widely debated instruments within Marinetti's
complex of entrepreneurial functions was the so-called <I>serata
futurista</I> ("Futurist evening" or "Futurist soir&eacute;e"). This
became a privileged form of communication during the "heroic" years of
Futurism prior to the Great War, an era when the theater was still an
important means of socialization that spanned the spectrum of Italian
culture, permitting people of different socio-economic strata to meet in
a single place without distinctions of class or income. From the ground
floor to the gallery and the boxes, the theater became a container
embracing everyone, a site in which the creativity of the Futurists
would spread like lava running from the mouth of a volcano: spectators
and artists became the chemical components of an incandescent fusion in
which the event was no longer the spectacle in itself, but the ensemble
of emotions, tensions, actions, and reactions being created.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's management of the <I>serata</I> revealed the same intense
concern with entrepreneurial values. In general he rented the theater
himself, and typically admission was priced very low or made free in
order to encourage an audience as large as possible. Every performance
was preceded by an advertising barrage that included advertisements in
the daily newspapers, posters on walls, and the distribution of leaflets
or handbills. The audience was largely composed of intellectuals,
professionals, and aristocrats, with a smaller representation of young
people and workers. The performance itself consisted of participants
presenting their paintings, reciting poetry or other "words-in-freedom"
compositions, or declaiming manifestos. Marinetti and his companions
insistently provoked the audience, which in turn responded by launching
missiles of every imaginable kind: the <I>serata</I> was transformed
into a miniature war that required a visceral involvement on the part
of the spectator. To quiet the brawls the police were typically called
in, unintentionally lending themselves to a role that had already been
scripted for them in advance. From beginning to end the entire event
was carefully choreographed by Marinetti, including the predictable
aftermath: daily newspapers promptly reported the event with shocked
headlines, lengthy articles that detailed the brawls in all their fury,
and editorial commentary that deplored the Futurist provocations, all
of these inadvertently furnishing the Futurists with advance publicity
for the next <I>serata</I> to follow.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even the tone that Marinetti used in his speeches and addresses to the
gallery was tinged with the language of advertising. On the one hand he
carefully sought to shock by deliberately taunting and provoking the
audience, while on the other hand he glorified the successes of his
group with a lyrical rhetoric of excessive emphasis. Not

<B></B>

untypical is a speech from one of the Futurist evenings that took place
in Florence in 1913 at the Teatro Verdi, in which Marinetti assaulted
the audience thus:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We are a handful of tamers here in this cage of wild animals that are
roaring and yet also frightened. You will leave here tamed, bearing
within yourselves an involuntary admiration for us that you will be
unable to repress....Seven thousand mediocrities against eight artists
whose formidable genius you cannot deny.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's activities as a publisher were strictly connected with his
propagandistic efforts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 In this regard his views owed much to wider changes that were taking
 place within the world of publishing in Italy, the outcome of a
 growing perception among contemporary intellectuals that cultural
 activity was something to be developed as part of a continuous
 process through a cycle of production and consumption, via specific
 channels and institutions. Reviews were now increasingly flanked by
 complementary cultural enterprises, such as publishing houses and retail
 outlets. Italian intellectuals who were most responsive to current
 events, in line with the industrial development that marked the era
 dominated by the governments of Giolitti, increasingly understood that
 culture was a product, and that as such, it was to be regulated by the
 laws of the market. Ideas, in order to become subjects of discussion,
 had to be widely diffused. Sharing this viewpoint, Marinetti had founded
 the journal <I>Poesia</I> in Milan in 1905, an eclectic monthly that
 hosted Symbolists, Parnassians, decadents, neo-romantics, modernists,
 the <I>crepuscolari</I>, and even authors writing in dialect. Yet its
 foundamental project was always that of self-promotion and publicity for
 Marinetti himself. The first number of the journal was announced with a
 "circular letter" prepared for the press, which adopted a synthetic and
 dramatic style of immediacy that indicated its origins in the language of
 advertising, a style that would become a constant in Futurism itself. By
 this time Marinetti was already standing accused of being an intellectual
 too attentive to the clamor of publicity, a weakness he was thought to
 share with Gabriele D'Annunzio, another great writer who understood the
 value of image and self-publicity in the modern society of the spectacle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Promotional systems created in support of the journal were numerous:
the habit of concocting "puffs" for the press, with reviews that were
prepared in advance; sending numerous copies of certain issues as
complimentary gifts to influential reviewers and authors; an insistent
program of editorial self-publicization; a constant search for
support for the journal from other intellectuals, including requests
for collaboration, which were also handsomely paid. More important,
authors were rewarded with res that ranged from one hundred liras
(received by the poet Giovanni Pascoli) to three hundred liras (offered
to d'Annunzio). Marinetti himself, it might be noted, much preferred
Pascoli as an author; his payments reflected not his value judgments,
but the fluctuations of the market.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Another feature designed to contribute to the journal's propaganda and
 self-publicity aims was the series of "inquests" that it sponsored: on
 "the beauty of Italian women," on "free verse," and

<B></B>

on and on. Still another were the contests for poetry and prose that
were open to the young and unknown. <I>Poesia</I>, moreover, was also
supported by a book series that published works by the authors who had
won its contests, or works that reported the results of inquests that
had proven especially controversial, such as the one on free verse
(<I>Enqu&ecirc;te internationale sur le vers libre</I> [International
inquest on free verse; 1909]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 And finally, in an Italian culture that was still largely provincial in
 nature, the international character of <I>Poesia</I> gave it a special
 glitter, even as it simultaneously served a crucial function as a bridge
 between Italy and the rest of Europe. One need only glance at a number
 of issues to see how many authors of genuinely international caliber
 were offered to the Italian public: William Butler Yeats, Alfred Jarry,
 Jean Cocteau, Paul Claudel, Miguel de Unamuno, the Russian symbolist poet
 Valery Bryusov, or the Greek national poet Costas Palam&agrave;s. To be
 sure, cosmopolitanism was also a characteristic innate in Marinetti's
 personality. An Italian who was born in Egypt, he had been educated
 in French and felt far more comfortable writing in it than in Italian
 until perhaps as late as 1915, and his earliest literary efforts were
 directed at taking of the role of a "Franco-Italian" poet. All these
 circumstances meant that Marinetti tended to regard culture as an
 essentially comparative and international activity, with the result
 that versions in multiple languages also became a recurrent feature of
 Marinetti's publishing activities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The journal <I>Poesia</I> continued to appear until 1909, serving as a
springboard for the launching of Futurism. Yet while it reprinted "The
Founding and First Manifesto," its publication was suspended shortly
thereafter. It had proven an invaluable testing ground for the techniques
of cultural communication that the movement would subsequently adopt,
but it remained inextricably tied to the hinterland of Symbolism by its
origins, its collaborators, and its history, and after the break announced
by Futurism, Marinetti strove to keep his distance from Symbolism in
all its forms. Notwithstanding the suppression of the journal, its book
publishing imprint ("Editions of <I>Poesia</I>") continued to be kept in
existence, and in 1910 it was renamed only slightly as "Futurist Editions
of <I>Poesia</I>," retaining a reminder of the earlier review that had
hovered so precariously between the past and the future. From now on
it would be the book that became the principal means for diffusing the
movement's poetics and propaganda, one of the most vital functions of the
complex Futurist organism. The "Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>" were
soon flanked by other series and imprints that were typically connected
to particular groups of Futurists in specific cities and their reviews:
Marinetti's movement became extraordinarily extensive and multifarious,
not limited to a single cenacle. Increasingly it was structured like a
political party, guided by a charismatic leader and possessing an official
policy that was shaped by Marinetti's closest collaborators, generally
the best and most prominent painters and poets. Yet it could also count
upon an extensive network of Futurist groups that were scattered in
every region of Italy, as well as on a number of sympathizers abroad.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The existence of such groups inevitably generated autonomous initiatives
that could then be supported or absorbed by Marinetti, such as
<I>Lacerba</I>, the review

<B></B>

founded by Giovanni Papini and Ardengo Soffici in Florence in
1913. They soon allied themselves with Marinetti, who undertook
much of the journal's distribution on his own account for as long as
the collaboration lasted. How many readers followed the journal is
difficult to establish, as is also the case with the earlier review,
<I>Poesia</I>. Yet it is safe to say that press runs were quite high
in comparison with those of contemporaneous literary journals. Exact
res do not exist for <I>Poesia</I>, though the number of retail
outlets that carried it (which the journal listed in every issue) and
the letters from readers (which were published in a regular rubric)
suggest a rather ample diffusion. Marinetti himself remarked upon the
press runs of <I>Poesia's</I> last two numbers, which were issued in
quantities much larger because dedicated to Futurism: thirty thousand
copies of the penultimate number, forty thousand for the final one. Yet
these are res that need to be compared with actual inventories or
press orders, sinch Marinetti was not averse to inflating his reports
for advertising purposes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For <I>Lacerba</I>, on the other hand, there are more reliable res
available for comparison. The review had a considerable impact and its
engaging polemical battles left an indelible impression in the memory of
intellectuals of the time. Even Gramsci was intrigued by it, as he was
by Marinetti and the Futurists in general, and in 1922 he wrote a letter
to Trotsky in which he stated that <I>Lacerba</I> had a press run of
"twenty thousand copies" and "four out of five copies had circulated
among workers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The re differs little from one recalled by Marinetti in a letter
 written to Mario Carli in 1919, when Carli was director of the newspaper
 <I>Roma Futurista</I>: "I am convinced that when censorship disappears,
 it would be possible to surpass the largest press runs of <I>Lacerba</I>,
 which were 18,000 copies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 But both these accounts differ significantly from res offered by
 more contemporary documents. Aldo Palazzeschi, in a letter written
 on 16 May 1913 to Attilio Vallecchi, the printer of <I>Lacerba</I>,
 speaks of only "ten thousand copies," while Giovanni Papini, writing
 a bit earlier to Palazzeschi, described the journal's success in the
 following terms: "<I>Lacerba</I> is selling like hot cakes. A great
 deal of discussion--and conversions everywhere. The number has been
 well received and very few of the 8,000 copies are left."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 And only a few days earlier Papini had written Marinetti to say that
 he was sending him copies of <I>Lacerba</I> to distribute at his own
 expense:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Today the printing of <I>L[acerba]</I> was finished and you should
immediately receive 3000 copies. At the beginning you will find an
article of mine which I have chosen to title Against Futurism. Don't be
alarmed. I have done so deliberately in order to attract attention and
arouse people's curiosity. It is a defense of the Fut[urists]...Don't be
upset if I repeat in several places that I am <I>not</I> a Futurist. For
tactical reasons that is a necessity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This letter reveals a considerable awareness of the mechanisms of
propaganda, as Papini describes an essay whose title appears to be
an assault against Marinetti's movement, but which actually announces
<I>Lacerba's</I> shift toward a position in its

<B></B>

favor. Papini cunningly exploits widespread hostility against Futurism
in order to thwart his readers' expectations and so prove all the more
shocking.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti, it should be noted, could sustain his role as an impresario
of poets and painters not only because of his formidable managerial
capacities, but also because of his substantial wealth. In 1907,
upon the death of his father, he had inherited a conspicuous sum of
money. Exactly how much is not known, though Marinetti himself, in his
memoirs dictated many years later, recorded that a French newspaper with
a large circulation reported at the time that his inheritance amounted
to eighty million liras.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Marinetti, in any event, employed his patrimony to finance Futurism
 with uncommon generosity and with a perceptive sense of how to create a
 more enduring kind of goods: today the works that his movement produced
 and the books that his publishing house issued constitute an object
 of great value both in the world of culture and in the domain of the
 market. Marinetti himself defined the motivations that prompted him to
 become an impresario of unknown talents in the following terms.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I had the good fortune to inherit a substantial sum from my father, but
I chose not to use it in a manner either base or banal. I have, instead,
availed myself of the opportunities offered by independence to realize a
vast and audacious plan for intellectual and artistic renewal in Italy:
to protect, encourage, and materially to help the young, innovative,
and rebellious minds that are daily suffocated by the indifference, the
avarice, or the myopia of publishers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti spoke these words in his defense during the trial on charges
of pornography that were lodged against him in 1910 for the presence of
several erotic scenes in the novel <I>Mafarka il futurista</I> (Mafarka
the Futurist; 1910).
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 As was typical for Marinetti, his case was pleaded by a trio of
 illustrious lawyers (Innocenzo Cappa, Cesare Sarfatti, Salvatore
 Barzilai) and supported by an expert witness who was then of considerable
 renown, the author Luigi Capuana, all of which enabled him to turn the
 trial into yet another publicity success that was partly achieved through
 his careful organization of a press campaign involving intellectuals
 from Italy and abroad, a success that also helped to speed the book's
 translation into Russian and Spanish. And yet it remains a fact that
 Marinetti's cultural entrepreneurship was based upon a disinterested
 love of art which was combined with his wish to address the need
 for an alternative space that could sustain the talents he wished
 to launch into the marketplace of art and literature: the painters
 Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr&agrave;, Luigi Russolo, Gino Severini,
 Ardengo Soffici, Fortunato Depero, Enrico Prampolini, as well as the
 writers Aldo Palazzeschi, Corrado Govoni, Paolo Buzzi, Luciano Folgore,
 Francesco Cangiullo, and many others. Paolo Buzzi, the first poet whose
 work was published by Marinetti in book form, later recalled:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Because of my poverty and the necessity that I faced of having to find
a job, which required studies that were not intellectual in nature, my
literary tendencies would have been dead heaven only knows how long ago
if I had not met with that electric lighthouse

<B></B>

 that you know of. And later, having come into contact with publishers,
 some of them quite large ones, I immediately perceived the evil
 mediocrity and the fierce mentality of the petty shopkeeper that animate
 them: with the result that returning to the old and crazy publishing
 house [of Marinetti] always gave me a shiver of enthusiasm and, more
 important, a bit of courage, of faith in the future.

The "Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>" were perhaps the most important
embodiment of Marinetti's desire to create an alternative cultural space,
becoming an experimental laboratory in the true sense of the term, where
the canons of a new writing,  the "words-in-freedom," were successively
elaborated and consecrated for the first time with Marinetti's celebrated
<I>Zang Tumb Tuuum</I> .
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Marinetti himself was perfectly clear about his aims and the role of the
 publishing house within a larger artistic reawakening: "We reserve the
 'Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>' for those works that are absolutely
 Futurist in their violence and intellectual extremism and that cannot
 be published by others because of their typographical difficulties."

Marinetti, then, was a publisher whose activities were largely unaffected
by the need to make money. Instead they resembled those of so-called
engaged or committed editors such as Giuseppe Prezzolini and Piero
Gobetti, though with some crucial differences: the impulse of extreme
avant-gardism, on the one hand, and the communicative systems that were
adopted to embody that impulse, on the other. Whereas Prezzolini and
Gobetti were deeply concerned with questions of pedagogy and the formation
of a civic elite, Marinetti placed more emphasis on the circulation of
ideas per se and, therefore, on propaganda. More concretely, Marinetti
tended to give away a remarkably high percentage of the copies from any
given press run of a book, almost wholly neglecting their distribution in
retail outlets such as bookstores. Journalists, politicians, artists,
intellectuals, industrialists, potential sympathizers and active
rivals--all found themselves flooded with gratis copies of books,
newspapers, journals, magazines, and leaflets streaming forth from the
Marinetti factories. The poet Aldo Palazzeschi later recalled with wry
humor his own naivet&eacute; and surprise when first confronted with
Marinetti's plans to compose hundreds of dedicatory inscriptions--not
for Marinetti's book, but for Palazzeschi's own--to people with whom
Palazzeschi had no relations at all:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
No sooner had the book been printed in a thousand copies than the question
arose of what to do about the number of copies customarily sent gratis to
members of the press and perhaps a few friends. At this point Marinetti
handed me a fat notebook. I began leafing through it with a growing
sense of fear and dismay. It contained some seven hundred names, together
with their addresses and a model of the sort of dedication that each was
to receive. The few remaining copies of my book, I was informed, could
be sent to a few booksellers in the larger cities, though without any
hurry and as if it were a fact of no importance in comparison with the
announcement that the book was already sold out, which had also been
prepared in advance. The list comprehended a most wild and unsuspected
variety of persons: men from the worlds of politics and culture, prominent
industrialists and professionals, men and women of society, among whom
were people who were truly famous and in some cases notorious for their

<B></B>

 implacable opposition to Futurism, persons who would surely throw the
 book away with a curse, or would even burn it. But it was exactly those
 who didn't want it, according to Marinetti's theory, who had to receive
 it....I was resolutely opposed to a project of this kind and after
 much discussion we at last agreed that I would make a wide selection
 in my own way from the six or seven hundred addresses, reducing it to
 almost half. I also announced firmly that I was not prepared to write
 hundreds of dedications to persons whom I didn't know.... "Don't worry,"
 replied Marinetti, "I'll dictate the inscriptions myself, and you can
 copy them down."

In lavishing gratis copies upon an unsuspecting world Marinetti was
violating one of the cardinal principles of the publishing trade, that of
profit. But his real goal was to see the book distributed as rapidly as
possible, attempting to augment its value with a maximum of commitment to
advertising and promotion. Such techniques horrified Giuseppe Prezzolini,
who, though hardly a commercial publisher, liked to think of himself as
a cultural impresario with experience in the techniques of organizing
intellectual activities, and on these grounds offered a defense for the
laws of the marketplace:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A Futurist book is no longer worth a penny...who would ever be such an
imbecile as to buy a Futurist volume when everyone knows that all one
has to do is send a greeting card to F. T. Marinetti, Corso Venezia, 61,
Milan, to have the mail disgorging a large packet full of books upon one's
doorstep--and to know that one will regularly receive all the others
that the factory of Futurism will publish in the future?...Something
that is given away has less value than something bought....

Prezzolini's judgment is quite plainly and quite wholly
negative. Marinetti is not a cultural organizer, but a "disorganizer." Yet
his analysis fails to take into account the situation in which Marinetti
was operating: that of the avant-garde, which by its very nature tends
to violate every received law, placing itself in a polemical relation to
reigning rules and protocols. Marinetti, in fact, privileged the immediate
diffusion of the creative product, imposing it upon the public with rules
and rhythms of his own making: the gratis copy, on closed analysis, is
an expedient for rapidly and indeed almost immediately making contact
with the right people, for eliminating the mediation of distributors
and bookstores. Though a portion of a press run might be reserved for
the normal channels of sales and distribution, it was always a minor one.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Oddly, this publishing system did not prevent some books from selling
quite well, such as the collectively authored volume <I>I poeti
futuristi</I> (The Futurist poets; 1912), which, with a "<I>real</I>
press run of 20,000 copies,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 soon proved a remunerative enterprise. Exulting in his triumph, Marinetti
 announces his promotion of it to Palazzeschi: "It will be distributed
 in Europe and America, with more than American vigor. I will place two
 to three hundred copies at the disposition of each contributing poet."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 His project proved successful and the anthology sold well; Marinetti,
 evidently satisfied, informed Palazzeschi that booksellers were
 repeatedly placing orders for more copies:

This one is selling in a truly exceptional way.... To think of it! Some
booksellers, such as Baldini and Castoldi, for example, have requested
additional copies seven times, which means that we have already sold

volume of <I>Poeti futuristi</I> is competing with the war for space.

One more example might be the pamphlet "Sintesi futurista della guerra"
(Futurist synthesis of the war; 1914), printed in the climate of the
interventionist campaign, which had a press run of "more than 20,000
copies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 It depicts the World War through the graphic image of a wedge, with
 the word "Futurism" written in the center, the top of which touches a
 curve representing "Pass&eacute;ism," a composition anticipating that
 of the famous <I>Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge</I> (1919-20) by
 El Lissitzky.

Already these res suggest that Marinetti, far from being solely the
"disorganizer" indicted by Prezzolini, was in reality an "organizer"
of an entirely new type,  the inventor of the artistic avant-garde
as a cultural enterprise and shaper of public opinion. This was a
dialectical phenomenon composed of two opposing factors: destruction and
construction. In Futurist theory and practice the nihilistic aspects
are united with the constructive ones in a mixture of spontaneity and
rationality, a mixture characteristic of Marinetti's own personality,
in which the absolute love of poetry "was accompanied by exceptional
organizational and propagandistic gifts, in which, in a Nietzschean
manner, a sultry heart coexisted with a cool mind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti, moreover, was an artisan of great stature. If his objectives
were grandiose, his enterprise for realizing them was remarkably small. In
the "heroic" period of the "words-in-freedom," one of his followers
(Cesare Cavanna) collaborated closely with a trusted typographer
(working for Angelo Taveggia) under directions furnished by Marinetti
during every stage of printing, from the rough sketch to the completed
volume. Busying himself with every detail, from the selection of paper
to the design of the cover, all the way up to the launching of publicity
and press relations, Marinetti displayed an uncommon degree of skill
and mastery of detail. And yet the editorial committee of Futurism was
extremely modest, composed of Marinetti and his secretary Decio Cinti,
his two servants Marietta and Nina Angelini, and one or more Futurist
volunteers (Boccioni, Buzzi, Russolo), with its headquarters always
located in his house in Milan, until 1912 at Via Senato, 2, and then
until 1924 in Corso Venezia, 61.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet if the institutional structure in which Marinetti's publishing
activities unfolded was essentially artisanal in nature, his editions
pursued goals that might well be termed industrial, goals expressed both
in the publicity systems that he used and in the substantial press runs
that he printed, typically ranging from one to two thousand copies, with
an occasional run of twenty thousand. The first edition of Palazzeschi's
<I>L'Incendiario</I> (Arsonist; 1910) was roughly a thousand copies, the
second  surpassed two thousand. Nearly always, however, Marinetti
announced press runs that were far above the real res: on the cover
of Luciano Folgore's <I>Il</I> 

<B></B>

<I>canto dei motori</I> (The song of motors; 1912), for example, he
reports that the edition comprises "eight thousand copies." But in
private he wrote to Folgore, "I have had 2,000 copies of your volume
printed, so there should be some left over. For the others, naturally,
the press run is at least seven or eight thousand copies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet whatever the res, they are considerably higher than the one
hundred copies of the first books of Guillaume Apollinaire and Max Jacob,
published by the art dealer and publisher Kahnweiler, or the three to six
hundred copies of the works of Mayakovsky, also published in the Futurist
series though outside of the official publishing house. Yet such large
press runs, notable for a publishing firm as small as Marinetti's really
was, responded to a self-conscious decision: Marinetti was opposed to
the rare and precious volume, printed in a limited quantity of numbered
copies and destined for a wealthy public, for bibliophiles or art
collectors, and instead he viewed the book as a militant product aimed
at wide usage. In this respect his editions differed both from those
of the Cubists, Dadaists, and Surrealists--almost always in limited
editions ornamented with engravings and designs--and from those of
the Russian Futurists, self-published with duplicating machines and
artisanal decorations. Marinetti, in other words, genuinely believed in
the possibility of an avant-garde publishing venture that would extend
far beyond purely literary and artistic circles to reach the man in
the street.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most interesting editorial goals that he pursued was
represented by the so-called "typographic revolution" theorized in
the manifestos on literature. Through a subversion of the rules of
composition, Marinetti proposed to regenerate the book by means of a new
compositional and graphic language. The page, no longer viewed as passive
screen conditioned by rules of symmetry and harmony, becomes a dynamic
field that is open to the games of free and expressive orthography,
to the visual values of letters themselves, to the sounds and noises
represented typographically, and to graphic components and designed
analogies. Typography, no longer considered the humble maidservant of
writing, is called upon to play an essential role in the process of
the work's creation: for the first time within the Gutenbeg Galaxy one
witnesses a hot fusion of technology and poetry. The book is transformed
into a living organism that implies the involvment of the reader, to
whom is assigned the task of interpreting and decoding the message, now
constructed of linguistic, verbal, phonetic, and visual materials. If
the Futurist painters sought to place the spectator at the center of
the canvas, Marinetti, with his creation of "words-in-freedom," pursued
a similar goal: to place the reader at the center of the book and the
page. Such a program destroys the traditional role of illustration as
something posterior that has been  tied on to the text; all the visual
aspects of the work are now resolved within the ambience of free-word
writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The precedent for this utilization of typography for its expressive
functions, as is well known, was set by Mallarm&eacute; in his poem
"Un coup de d&eacute;s jamais n'abolira le hasard," which for the first
time had introduced into poetry the use of typographical characters in
a manner that had hitherto been reserved for newspapers and posters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 But Marinetti's "words-in-freedom" codified this new expressiveness
 and made it

<B></B>

correspond to the perceptual simultaneity that typified the new
man shaped by technology. Marinetti's theories unleashed a flood of
"words-in-freedom" writing in Futurist journals, newspapers, and books,
and those that were issued by his own publishing firm included a number
of modern classics: Luciano Folgore's <I>Ponti sull'Oceano</I> (Bridges
on the ocean; 1914), which had a cover designed by Sant'Elia; Corrado
Govoni's extraordinary pictographs and typographical experiments
in <I>Rarefazioni e Parole in Libert&agrave;</I> (Rarefactions and
words-in-freedom; 1915); Paolo Buzzi's <I>L'Elisse e la Spirale</I>
(The helix and the spiral; 1915); Francesco Cangiullo's <I>Piedigrotta</I> ; and Marinetti's own masterpieces, <I>Zang Tumb Tuum</I>
 and <I>Les mots en libert&eacute; futuristes</I> (Futurist
words-in-freedom; 1919). In addition to these there were the three
major theoretical works that would prove of great importance for the
future of the avant-garde: Boccioni's <I>Pittura Scultura Futuriste</I>
(Futurist painting scupture; 1914); Carr&agrave;'s <I>Guerrapittura</I>
(Warpainting; 1915), and Russolo's <I>L'arte dei rumori</I> (The art of
noises; 1916).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The period dominated by the "free-word" works represented the most
significant moment in the trajectory of Marinetti's editorial activities,
a trajectory that encompassed two distinct phases: one centered in Milan,
the other in Rome. The first includes the period generally referred to
as the moment of "heroic" futurism, from 1909 to 1914, as well as the
years of the Great War and the early 1920s. The second begins in 1925,
the year when Marinetti moved to Rome to an apartment on Piazza Adriana,
30, and continues until 1943, the year of Mussolini's fall. The later
stage was marked by a drop in the level of production and a change in
the criteria that guided Marinetti's operations as a publisher. After
1925 or thereabouts, Marinetti no longer availed himself of the kinds
of publicity and advertising systems that he had used so effectively
before: the pamphelts and "puffs" that had been prepared for the press
disappeared, and even the name "Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>" was
reduced to a trademark that was frequently ceded to authors who paid
their own costs of publication. Nor was there a favored typographer
who executed complex works under Marinetti's close supervision; now
each author would usually follow his own publication through whatever
press was located most conveniently for him. Marinetti, it should be
added, also found himself in a period when his financial resources
were severely reduced. The changed circumstances meant that books of
exceptional quality now became a rarity, though there were still the two
extraordinary books of "litho-tin," which is to say, books made entirely
of tin with full-color serigraphs. They constitute the farthest point
that Marinetti reached in his experiments with the book as object: one
was titled <I>L'anguria lirica</I> (The lyrical watermelon; 1934) by
Tullio d'Albisola, with designs by Bruno Munari; the other, <I>Parole
in libert&agrave; futuriste tattili termiche olfattive</I> (Futurist
words-in-freedom, tactile thermic olfactory; 1932), by Marinetti with
graphics by Tullio d'Albisola.

Writing in 1916, Terenzio Grandi argued that there was a deep consonance
between the aesthetic principles of the Futurists and what he called
"the art of typography." a common ground that had a double aspect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 On the one hand, Marinetti's "words-in-freedom" used certain expressive
 modules plainly derived from the lettering

<B></B>

of contemporary advertisements, while on the other it was becoming
increasingly evident that more advanced and modern advertisements
were drawing upon styles and designs that had been pioneered by
Futurism. Marinetti was aware of these later developments and did much
to encourage them, and by the later 1930s, when advertising graphics
were being rapidly developed in Italy under the influence of Futurism,
"elementary typography," and Bauhaus, Marinetti could justly claim that
much of the most recent advertising was drawing upon ideas that stemmed
from the grammar and aesthetics of his movement:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Commercial firms were increasingly demanding a maximum of clarity without
any possible equivocation concerning their product or their location and
in wall posters this produced a sudden revolution of words-in-freedom with
its plastic typography in multiple perspectives reliefs planes depths
with its free orthography its alogical shifts in time of words outside
of syntax and literary habits. Words in freedom were found running
luminously across the fronts of buildings and the terraces of houses
climbing everywhere stripped of syntax and ready to say everything because
they had become plastic in their isolation and their percussive throbbing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through the vehicle of advertising the avant-garde had invaded the great
cities and so realized one of the Futurist ambitions: to leave the museum
and extend art into the streets and public spaces, as Mayakovsky had
so famously announced. When an austerity program prompted the fascist
regime to threaten abolishing electric signs in the center of Milan,
Marinetti swiftly wrote an open letter to Mussolini in their defense,
arguing that they created a "childish" and "illusory nocturnal jewelry"
that constituted the modern decoration of the metropolis, a viewpoint
that had already been implicitly formulated by Sant'Elia in his designs
for the "new city" in 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Especially during the 1920s and 1930s many Futurists, and chiefly
 Fortunato Depero, worked actively in the world of advertising,
 designing billboards, graphics, booths and pavilions for commercial
 fairs, shopwindows, and theoretical texts. The great example of the
 collective contribution of the group was supposed to be the <I>Almanacco
 dell' Italia veloce</I> (Almanac of quickening Italy), a volume that
 was announced on several occasions but never actually issued; a single
 specimen of it has survived, rich in original graphic formulations by
 Balla, Prampolini, and others, and preceded by a theoretical essay by
 Marinetti that urges the necessity of advertising that is multimedia
 and many faceted in its expressiveness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 The urge to combine art and advertising found curious expression in two
 of Marinetti's late books: one, <I>Il poema del vestito di latte</I>
 (The poem of the clothing made of milk; 1937), which is a hymn to the
 wool-like synthetic "lanital," extracted from the chemical caseine,
 and <I>Il poema di torre viscosa</I> (The poem of the viscose tower;
 1938), which treats the production of cellulose. Both were published
 by the National Italian Company for Viscose, and neither is valued very
 highly today.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What these productions Marinetti had essentially come full circle, from
the publicity of art to the art of publicity, always in search of a new
lexicon with which to attract the public, always seeking news ways to
transmit and popularize the products

<B></B>

of Futurism. Whereas earlier he had sought to employ the tools
of publicity within the environment of art, now he sought to employ
art and artists in the world of advertising. And yet throughout the
long course of his career he displayed the same exceptional gift for
inventing strategies and tactics in order to market the objects that he
considered to be of value. Rarely have the poet and the entrepreneur been
so combined in a single re. Yet as one critic has observed, the scales
were never evenly weighted; Marinetti always remained "more responsive
to the exciting odor of talents waiting to be picked just at the moment
of birth than faithful to the dogmas that he himself had proposed."

Ebbi la fortuna di ereditare da mio padre una discreta sostanza, ma non me
ne sono mai servito in modo basso e banale. Mi sono avvalso, anzi della
mia posizione indipendente per attuare un mio vasto e audace progetto di
rinovamento intellettuale e artistico in Italia: quello di proteggere,
incoraggiare ed aiutare materialmente i giovani ingegni novatori e ribelli
che quotidianamente vengono soffocati dall'indifferenza, dall'avarizia
o dalla miopia degli editori.

Causa la mia povert&agrave; e la necessit&agrave; che ebbi di conquistarmi
un posto con studi antideali, le mie tendenze letterarie sarebbero morte
chiss&agrave; da quanto, se non avessi incontrato il faro elettrico di
che sai. E, venuto a contatto con gli editori anche grandi, mi avvidi
subito della cattiva mediocrit&agrave; e del bottegaismo feroce che li
anima: cosicch&eacute; il tornare, con una opera di poesia disinteressata,
all'antica fucina folle, mi diede sempre un fremito d'entusiasmo e, quel
che pi&ugrave; conta, un po' di coraggio, di fede verso l'avvenire.

Non appena in mille copie fu stampato il libro, trattandosi di
consegnare i consueti omaggi alla stampa e a qualche amico, Marinetti
a tale proposito mi consegn&ograve; un grosso scartafaccio che presi
a sfogliare con progessivo sgomento. Si trattava di settecento e
pi&ugrave; nominativi con relativo indirizzo e ai quali con tanto di
dedica si doveva mandarlo. Le poche e sparute copie rimaste sarebbero
state dispensate ad alcuni librai delle principali citt&agrave; senza un
minimo di fretta come fatto di nessuna importanza dopo quel tutto esaurito
che lo aveva preceduto. La nota comprendeva le pi&ugrave; svariate persone
e i pi&ugrave; insospettati personaggi: uomini politici e di cultura,
professori, industriali e professionisti, gentildonne e gentiluomini,
fra cui risultavano quali astri di prima grandezza proprio quelli che si
sapeva essere i pi&ugrave; feroci e irriducibili nemici di tale impresa, e
che lo avrebbero gettato con infamia e magari bruciato, ma erano proprio
quelli che non lo volevano, secondo la teoria di Marinetti, che dovevano
averlo....Mi opposi risolutamente a un simile progetto e venimmo a patti
che in quei settecento e pi&ugrave; indirizzi avrei fatto un'ampia scelta
a modo mio e che si ridusse presso a poco alla met&agrave;, non solo, ma
mi dichiarai impreparato nel modo pi&ugrave; preciso a scrivere centinaia
di dediche a persone che non conosceve...."Le dediche te le detto io,"
rispose Marinetti.
