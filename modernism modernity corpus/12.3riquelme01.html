Hugh Kenner, who died in November, 2003, was the most influential interpreter of Anglo-American literary modernism in the decades after WWII, the period during which the modernists themselves changed from contemporary writers to dead authors of an earlier era. With his death Kenner has definitively become part of the past, part of the history of how attitudes toward <i>modernism</i> emerged in critical thinking about literature between 1950 and 1990, the four decades in which Kenner published over a dozen books focusing on modernist writers. But that past is <i>our</i> past, and the term that stands in the names of both the Modernist Studies Association and this journal is <i>our</i> term, one that will be of continuing, living significance only as long as it remains in revisionary flux. As Eliot memorably remarks in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" concerning the claim that "'dead writers are remote from us because we <i>know</i> so much more than they did'," "they are that which we know."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The seven brief essays that follow concerning modernism after Kenner contribute to our recognizing the lineaments of literary modernism: as it came to us from an earlier generation of critics, as we have reconceived it, and as we could come to understand it in the future. They are versions (in most cases abridged) of papers delivered at the two Kenner roundtables at MSA6 in Vancouver and at the panel on "Hugh Kenner's Portraits of Modernism in Perspective" at MLA 2004 in Philadelphia. These three sessions, others that occurred during 2004, and 

<b></b>

already published responses to Kenner and his work after his death indicate Kenner's continuing importance to contemporary critics of modernism, whether they primarily admire his views or resist them.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As the ambiguity of "After Kenner" suggests, our directions post-Kenner may in some regards be in the mode of Kenner, though they are necessarily different because subsequent, and they may be actively opposed to what preceded them, which some would like to leave behind. We are in the midst of accepting and extending, modifying, and sometimes discarding the insights of a previous generation in a mixed response to them and to new evidence and new thinking. Ignoring those insights is not an option.
</p>

<p>
Various issues and recognitions emerge in these essays concerning Kenner's strategies and attitudes and their implications for modernism as he understood it and as we have redescribed it. The subjects include Kenner's relation to formalism, and the place and adequacy of formalist descriptions in modernist studies; more broadly, the character of the work of art as variously understood by Kenner, by post-structuralist thinkers, and by us; the differences between intellectual influences that shaped Kenner's thinking and those encountered by later critics, including critics who draw on recent humanistic theories; the ethical implications of attitudes toward hierarchies of various kinds, including hierarchies of race, gender, and class, in responses to modernism; differing conceptions of the modernist canon; and the character and efficacy of Kenner's distinctive style of writing and argumentation as a response to modernism. Kenner's wide-ranging, highly influential, plentiful writings about modernism provide a basis for reflecting on the kinds of works and authors we as interpreters of modernism praise or depreciate, the styles we adopt in writing about modernism, the ethical positions we take, the intellectual resources we draw on, the theoretical assumptions we make about the work of art, and the anthropological implications of our views.
</p>

<p>
The sharpest disagreements emerge concerning Kenner's judgments about Bloomsbury and his mapping of an international modernism. Although Christine Froula admires Kenner's ability to produce insights based on details, she faults him for what she regards as mistakes and wrongheaded judgments that limit his greatness. Marjorie Perloff, on the other hand, recognizes the harshness of some of Kenner's judgments but considers him a great, radical critic, a kind of poet-critic, whose advocacy was sometimes irritating because of its iconoclasm. There is, by contrast, general agreement about Kenner's relation to formalism: that he was at odds with New Criticism but, like the New Critical formalists, he attended closely to details. Gerald Bruns describes Kenner's allegiance to a strain of Enlightenment thinking that led him to scrutinize random particles in detail as part of an anti-Romantic "rejection of subjectivist poetics" (a rejection he shared with New Criticism). In his contribution to the MLA session (not published here), Walter Benn Michaels characterized Kenner as both a historicist and an intentionalist (neither stance compatible with New Criticism) in <i>The Counterfeiters</i> , his meditation on the aesthetic of the counterfeit. Froula calls him the inaugurator of "a new historicism <i>avant la lettre.</i>" Margot Norris finds a "principled rigor" in Kenner's readings that combines an empirical emphasis on details with a sensitivity to multiple voices (as in the Uncle Charles Principle) to produce readings closer to 

<b></b>

post-structuralism than to New Criticism. Jennifer Wicke identifies in Kenner's close attention to language and style an Aquinian element, evident as well in the thinking of his early mentor, Marshall McLuhan, that refuses to occlude the body. She characterizes the formalism of modernism in Kenner's work as "materialist, bodily, and communal, a history-filled knowledge." The poet that he places at the center of modernism is, in Wicke's formulation, a Pound of flesh.
</p>

<p>
Like Wicke's commentary, Barry Ahearn's brings into view intellectual influences that contribute to making Kenner both distinctive and different from most later critics of modernism. Ahearn traces the pre-Cartesian (and anti-Cartesian), Franciscan-like view of language he finds in Kenner to a Catholic intellectual heritage, which Kenner acquired in part through Marshall McLuhan and Walter J. Ong, S. J. Recognizing that influence helps us situate Kenner's early work during a period in which the writings about art and culture by Catholic intellectuals contemporary with modernist writers (including Jacques Maritain, Etienne Gilson, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S. J.) were more widely known and discussed in North America than they are today. Gilson, for an extended period, and Maritain, more briefly, were both associated with the University of Toronto, where McLuhan taught and Kenner studied. Kenner's knowledge of the Catholic intellectual tradition puts him in a distinctive and advantageous position for responding to authors, such as Joyce and Eliot, who also knew that tradition. Other writers of Kenner's generation, including Umberto Eco, brought similar knowledge to bear, especially in readings of Joyce.
</p>

<p>
Kenner's intellectual background, including his classical education, did not prevent and may have contributed to his arresting effect on other readers of modernism who were differently equipped. Margot Norris is compellingly emphatic about Kenner's effect on Joyce studies, even suggesting that some of his insights have become part of a "critical unconscious," one that is compatible with post-structural theory. She points specifically to what Kenner called "the rhetoric of silence" as adding a critically dialogical element to our response, after Kenner, to Joyce. By identifying gaps in the narration, Kenner sometimes speculated about possibilities for filling them. In so doing, he created a doubled sense of what the works present directly and what they imply. His views are sometimes so unforgettably suggestive that they have established themselves in dialogue with the texts that are their ostensible objects. Norris's vision of Kenner is close to the claim I made in Dublin about Kenner as a maker of models, as a "literary mathematical Alexander Calder," who built his "models so prolifically and on such a scale that they became indistinguishable from our realities."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  For Norris Kenner brings out the writerly aspects of Joyce's texts without Roland Barthes's theoretical rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
Jennifer Wicke has a related aspect of Kenner's work in view when she mentions his use of montage, adopted from McLuhan, to exhibit "non-linear simultaneities" mosaically in order to produce in <i>The Pound Era</i> "an arcade," in Benjamin's sense of that word, "of modernity on the page." As I understand her point, these are not the simultaneities of Joseph Frank's "spatial form," which are visual and totalizing in character in a panoptical way. Instead, they result from Kenner's playing ear and time against vision. Again Kenner is proceeding theoretically in writing about literature and 

<b></b>

culture without recourse to theory. His implicit challenging of the eye's dominance by emphasizing the ear and time is in keeping with the post-Heideggerian thinking that many call deconstruction, but Kenner, like Kenneth Burke, develops original insights on native ground, in North America, without inspiration from Heidegger or Derrida.
</p>

<p>
The perspective that I develop in my contribution leads me to reconsider what "reading modernism, after Kenner," can mean, because Kenner, like Beckett, who enabled a crucial shift in Kenner's work, was already "after" modernism, as well as engaged and formed by it. We are <i>post-</i> in relation to a critic who had already crossed into that situation with regard to modernism. He moved, as have we, beyond the "transparent" technology that he identified with modernism in <i>The Mechanic Muse.</i> The shift, which involved cybernetics, is evident in a concern with anthropological issues that is most overt not in one of Kenner's books about modernism but in his reflections on Turing's game in <i>The Counterfeiters,</i> which Bruns comments on. There is a cyborg in Kenner, as there is in Beckett, and its implications necessarily give rise to speculations about technology, art, and the human, which Kenner pursued brilliantly. As Walter Benn Michaels asserted at the end of his commentary on "Hugh Kenner's Theory" at the MLA, "When and if someone who actually understands the central problems of modern literary theory writes its history, <i>The Counterfeiters</i> (not now in print) will be at its center."
</p>

<p>
Roland Barthes claims at the end of "The Structuralist Activity" that we experience validity but not truth when we recognize our situation as always historical, as part of a process of rearticulating the world's old languages on the way to having them respoken by some other language that will arise from history to replace ours. At the end of "From Work to Text," he suggests that we are cut off from past writings unless we reinscribe them by an "exceptional critical effort."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Barthes's views are revealing of our modernity. Kenner's exemplary achievement as Gerald Bruns describes it is his reconstructing and maintaining of modernism. He was a knowing mechanic in an implicitly Barthesian enterprise of dismantling and rebuilding the myths we generate to recognize what we can no longer be and also what we might, with continuing effort, become.
