<I>"Berlin Revisited" exists as a fifteen-page autograph manuscript
in the Lewis archive at Cornell. The first page is inscribed (not in
Lewis's hand) "Blasting &amp; Bombardiering," but in fact Lewis and his
wife visited Germany and Poland in October 1937, immediately after the
publication of that autobiography. (See Jeffrey Meyers, </I>The Enemy:
A Biography of Wyndham Lewis;<I> the 1935 visit mentioned in the first
sentence of the article is not recorded by Meyers.)</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I> During the mid-1930s, Lewis's promotion of an understanding with
the new Nazi regime in Germany brought him close to being an unofficial
apologist for it. His fear of a repetition of World War I, in which
he had served as an artillery officer, was an inextricable part of his
attitude. </I>Count Your Dead: They are Alive!,<I> published in April
1937, is the climax of his campaign. After the 1937 visit, Lewis made no
more attempts to persuade the British public of the beneficence of the
Nazis, and, as his biographer notes, decisively distanced himself from
anti-Semitism. "Berlin Revisited," then, records a visit that seems to
have coincided with the turning point in Lewis's attitude to Hitler's
Germany. It does not itself record the change of attitude, however. An
"extremely vulnerable"  Germany is still seen as a potential victim
of aggression. But Lewis is clearly disappointed by the lack of a heroic
temper in Berlin's well-dressed bourgeoisie (which indicates that he had
expected the Nazis to induce one). The shoppers and caf&eacute;-loungers
of Third City in the 1955 </I>Monstre Gai <I>(sometimes taken as a
reflection of Lewis's attitude to the Welfare State in postwar Britain)
clearly </I>

<B></B>

<I>owe something to his memories of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm in 1937.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
<I> In </I>Count Your Dead,<I> Lewis had half insinuated the existence of
a conspiracy by Jewish financiers to undermine European society by war,
just as Russia had been subverted by communism. He was shocked by his
visit to the Warsaw Ghetto, but there was evidently not yet sufficient
change in his worldview for him to do more than record without comment the
heroic or desperate Herr Israel's absurdist defiance of persecution.</I>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">
--<A HREF="#authbio">Paul Edwards</A>

<P>
A week or so ago I dropped into Berlin, which I had not visited
for two years. This time I stayed in a small hotel off the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm. The Kurf&uuml;rstendamm is a big boulevard,
thick with caf&eacute;s. It is a sort of little Paris consisting of
a single great boulevard, created under the Br&uuml;ning and earlier
r&eacute;gimes, in stark contrast with the old imperial city.

<P>
The "terraces" of these caf&eacute;s which lie thick along the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm are for the most part sumptuous marquees. Within these
spacious tents, infested with palms, the elegant ladies and gentlemen of
the new Berlin discuss coffee and cakes. These great <I>Konditoreien</I>
are somewhat oppressively respectable, and incidentally extremely
expensive.

<P>
It takes you a few days to sort out the essentials of this swarming
tent-life, of Berlin's fashionable boulevard. The first thing you remark
is the admirable taste displayed in all the clothes, hats, and shoes
worn. There is a great surface effect of luxury. But these are only
<I>Konditoreien,</I> or cake-and-coffee palaces, after all. If you go
into the equivalent of these places in the matter of restaurants--the
<I>Weinrestaurant</I>--you will find that more than half the customers
are not eating, or not more than one dish. They have the wine but not
the food of the wine-restaurant, many of them, whereas in London or
Paris they would all be eating a four-course dinner.

<P>
After this, and a few similar discoveries, seeing the extreme smartness,
notwithstanding, of these half-eaters, or mere drinkers, you will be
disposed to say to yourself that these Germans put all their available
cash on their backs.

<P>
But that would not be entirely correct. There is an explanation for this
paradoxal smartness. It is probably true to say that they put too much
of their money on their backs, and think too much of sitting for an hour
or two in the palmy tent of a <I>Konditorei,</I> over a cup of coffee,
trying to look as much as possible like a very rich and idle sportsman
or sportswoman, reposing after a strenuous day on the tennis-court. But
there is another factor which has to be taken into account.

<P>
If, after leaving the masses of sunburnt elegants toying with a cake and
exhibiting themselves to the passers-by, or entertaining each other in
the seclusion of an enormous marquee, you walk along the boulevard, you
will find yourself passing shop after shop of the extremest luxury. That
delicious mackintosh, with steel clasps in place of buttons, those
multi-coloured half-sandals, those attractive flounced jackets you have
just seen upon the bodies of the coffee-drinkers, you now see in the shop-windows.<B></B>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Approaching the shop-window, you find to your astonishment that they cost
 very little. The shoes that impressed you so much are only twelve marks
 and a half; the dresses which create such a voguish effect range from
 fifteen to fifty marks; there is a very smart straw helmet for ten pence!

<P>
It is not quite true, therefore, that these people put all their money
on their backs. For two or three pounds they can dress up like their
favourite film-heroine or hero, and cut a dash as a coffee drinker. And
for two or three marks they can exhibit themselves--they seldom talk
much, they are too busy looking and being looked at--sipping a <I>Moka</I>
and nibbling a cake.

<P>
The Germans have their fair share of the lady-and-gentleman complex, as
it might be called, of the modern democracy. Every nation has its own
variety of this absurdity. Where the Germans differ is that, with their
matchless efficiency, they have a far more thorough way of indulging
it and of showing it off. These big marquees and open tents in the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm are colossal tableau-vivants of genteelness.

<P>
What Hitler, with his dreams of a "classless society," must think of
all this I cannot imagine. But I suppose he doesn't think about it at
all, he has too much to attend to, building up the armoured shell for
his extremely vulnerable country.

<P>
The Kurf&uuml;rstendamm is still run by the Jews, or rather most of the
big shops still seem to be jewish--only they are diabolically cheap. Have
these keen traders been left there on the understanding that they smarten
up the Berliners at cost price? As a sort of defiance over one shop I
noticed, in large capitals, the name ISRAEL. Approaching it, I found it
was a dress shop. But the dresses were all most deplorably outmoded,
even crumpled, and one or two actually hung upside down. Imagine this
happening in the middle of Bond Street. A large shop, the window full
of a provincial stock, displayed with a deliberate, as it were insolent,
carelessness.

<P>
What Herr Israel may mean by this I cannot guess. With his coreligionists
all round it is a case of "business-as-usual." Only the implacable
Israel refuses to play, it would seem! With all his flags at half-mast
he breasts the storm.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P>
After having observed at my leisure the fashionable world of the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, I thought I would see what these people read. For
what <I>books</I> would go with this sort of outlook I felt I should like
to know. Entering one of the best of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm bookshops,
I bought a Dolphin--or a Penguin--and put to the gentleman who served
me my difficulty.

<P>
I had been much impressed, I told him, by the crowds I had seen outside,
and I wished to know what they read. Six or seven years ago, I informed
him, I had been greatly distressed to see nothing but detective stories
in the windows of German shops. This great intellectual nation had abased
itself before Edgar Wallace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Today there were none. Did this signify that today the German taste
 was better?

<P>
No, he answered, their taste was not better. Was it then worse? I
asked. No, he said. He volunteered the information that they had much
more money to spend today than a few years ago. Ah: but then their taste
<I>must</I> be better, said I. For they read better books.

<B></B>

<P>
He smiled. He said that did not follow. He said it was not because their
taste was better but because they could not get them, that they did not
read detective stories.

<P>
The German writers were all so ambitious and conceited, they
<I>refused</I> to write detective stories, it seemed. This I gathered
was one of the results of the new r&eacute;gime. He frankly regretted
this ambitious temper or this "author-complex," as we should call it
in England.

<P>
Besides, he informed me, intelligent people all liked detective stories. I
raised my eyebrows in astonishment. Noticing my surprise, he smiled
again. He assured me that that was the case.

<P>
I ventured the opinion that for a very intelligent man it might be an
excellent thing to read a crime story, but for the multitude crime
stories and nothing else was not the most suitable fare. That was a
point of view that was worth considering, he thought.

<P>
This was a bookseller of considerable pretensions. When I asked
him what anglo saxon books he sold most of he answered immediately
Santayana. Santayana is surely the softest and silkiest of all
philosophers. But my question had not contemplated the possibility
of philosophical nibblings. I had meant fiction. And for a great
philosophical race to indulge in Santayana was not very creditable,
anyway. It suggested a considerable weakening of the teeth.

<P>
I brought him back to earth, however, by saying I had had <I>fiction</I>
in mind. Morgan's <I>Fountain</I> seemed the next, after Santayana.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 I held up my finger peremptorily and said--

<P>
"You have forgotten!" He looked startled.

<P>
"Forgotten?" he asked.

<P>
"Yes," said I. "There is another name that should have come before that
of Morgan. Think again!"

<P>
He looked confused.

<P>
"Galsworthy!" I thundered.

<P>
For a fraction of a second he looked still more confused. Then he
assumed, as best he could, an expression of imperious indifference,
although palpably shaken.

<P>
"Galsworthy--yes," he exclaimed. "A year ago, perhaps. Not today. That
is over."

<P>
The meaning of all this is as follows. Galsworthy has for a long time been
the bible of the Germans. Middleclass Germany has absorbed the <I>Forsyte
Saga</I> to the exclusion of almost any other English author--excepting,
of course, Morgan's <I>Fountain,</I> from which cheaply platonic spring
they still refresh themselves in prodigious gulps.

<P>
The full nectar of the kindred <I>respectability</I> of Anglosaxony
was somehow to be found in Galsworthy more than in any other British
importation. A young German, for instance, told me that his sister, a
typical German girl, had read the <I>Forsyte Saga</I> ten times. He said
that when he would arrive home late at night--however late--he would
see a light in her room. Looking into it he would see her asleep, with
the <I>Forsyte Saga</I> still in her hand.

<P>
When this young German paid a visit to London he naturally bought
picture-postcards of Pall Mall, the Horseguards, and of the Houses of
Parliament. These he sent

<B></B>

to his sister in Berlin. On his return, he found that his sister had
stuck these postcards into her copy of the <I>Forsyte Saga,</I> opposite
the pages where the story speaks of these historic scenes.

<P>
All this I knew: I knew that to speak of the German Reading Public and
not to mention Galsworthy would be a case of Hamlet without the Prince
of Denmark.

<P>
After this visit to the <I>Buchhandlung</I> of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm I
made it my business to visit many other bookshops. The three bestsellers
among English books were, in every case, Galsworthy, Col. Lawrence, and
Morgan's <I>Fountain.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Those were always the first names that came to their lips. Of American
 books, Wolfe, the author of <I>Look Homeward Angel,</I> was the big
 noise. They had prospectuses from the Rowohltverlag of all his books,
 with the fine jewish head of the author on the cover. Hemingway is
 forbidden--Hemingway who is the incarnation of the spirit of physical
 adventure, the "tough guy" par excellence, and of all American authors
 the one you would think with most appeal for the Nazi Youth--the most
 unexceptionably "virile" reading.

<P>
For the rest, there is a spate of fashionable amateurs from England--such
as Mr Richard Wyndham and Mr Harold Nicholson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The latter gentleman refuses categorically to put his foot upon German
 soil, so great is his loathing for the Dritte Reich: but his books
 embellish all the shop-windows.

<P>
When one considers that the publication of books in Germany is rigidly
censored, these are eccentricities, to say the least. But these books are
not bestsellers. That is a curiosity of the censorship <I>Abteilung</I>
[department], and is no indication of German taste. For you may bring a
horse to the water, but you cannot, necessarily, make him drink. What
the German bookbuyer--that is to say the middle class--drinks down
in great draughts is Galsworthy. The lady-and-gentleman complex, as I
have called it, is satisfied by that better than by anything else. It
is deep calling to deep--the deep British respectability of Galsworthy
is answered by the deep respectability of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm.

<P>
Politics are far from my mind. The Nazi revolution is now an accomplished
fact. There it is, whether you like it or not: and I am not one of
those who has spent his time abusing it. But one thing we may surely
deduce from this scrutiny of the bookshops: namely that a kindred
<I>respectability,</I> almost as tenacious as that of England, has
survived, intact, into the new era.

<P>
"Tell me what a man eats, and I will tell you what he <I>is!</I>" Well,
for anybody who is able to augur from a book as well as some can from
a gastronomic <I>dossier,</I> the words "Forsyte" and "Fountain" are
eloquent.

<P>
A delusion of the Englishman--one among many--with respect to his German
cousin, is that the German is invariably crude and rough. We have in
England a disease called "refaynment"--something that causes the poor
fellow afflicted with it to say "nayce" instead of "nice."

<P>
But the German can be just as "refayned" if not more so. Do not run
away with the idea that every German gives utterance to a trenchant
"Nein!" when desiring to express negation. No. There are just as many
Germans who say "Nayn," or "fayn," for "nein" or "fein," as there are
Englishmen who say "nayce" for "nice."

<B></B>

<P>
Another illusion of the Englishman's is that the Germans are an
"intellectual" nation. That is of course absurd. The middleclass that was
dispossessed by the collapse of the <I>valuta</I> [exchange rate] just
after the war (to which, ultimately, the Nazi revolution must be traced)
yearn with an almost pathological intensity for <I>respectability.</I>
And, as a passion, respectability is at the opposite pole to the passions
of the intellect, if one may so express oneself.

<P>
I received, while I was in Germany, as great an impression as ever of
massive physical energy. Passing from Germany into Poland, the contrast,
in this respect, is very great. I should, quite dispassionately,
advise any country to think twice before it started dropping bombs on
the Germans. But in all those matters where sensibility and artistic
intelligence are concerned, it is another story. I must confess to having
experienced a certain shock, upon realizing the ineradicable "nayceness"
of the modern German mind. You know what it is--when you find that the
gladiator reads <I>Little Lord Fauntleroy</I> in his spare time, it is
sort of disillusioning. It should have been Aeschylus!
