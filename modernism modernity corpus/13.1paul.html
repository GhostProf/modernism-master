From the early 1920s when Benito Mussolini first came to power through the end of the first decade of the fascist rule, Margherita Sarfatti played a dominant role in the formulation of a new variety of Italian cultural nationalism. A cultural advisor, art critic, socialist turned fascist, and Mussolini's lover, she both directly and indirectly shaped the cultural policies of the Italian regime. As Victoria de Grazia suggests, Sarfatti "wielded immense personal power through her capacity to bring together intellectuals, artists, and the political personnel of the regime." Over time, she "manipulated the regime's burgeoning patronage networks to promote the <i>Novecento</i> as a 'national school,'" helped to found the review <i>Gerarchia,</i> largely created the public image of the Mussolini in her authorized biography <i>Dux</i> , and "reigned, doyenne of official intellectual life."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In their biography of Sarfatti, Philip V. Cannistraro, and Brian R. Sullivan have argued that "Margherita had brought a degree of cultural respectability to a movement that otherwise appeared to be nothing more than a gang of violent, anti-intellectual thugs."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Nancy Harrowitz has addressed Sarfatti's complicated identity as a Jewish woman (she later converted to Catholicism) involved in a largely masculinist and later anti-Jewish regime. Sarfatti, she writes, "was to a great degree the author of fascism itself and thus also the author of those conditions which produced such profound identity shifts within herself."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Despite her importance to this period of cultural history, however, Sarfatti's writings remain unavailable in English translation: a situation that the present dossier sets out to remedy in the form of a brief but representative sampling of her early writings on art for Mussolini's newspaper <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i>.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Margherita Grassini Sarfatti was born in Venice in April 1880 to wealthy, unassimilated Jewish parents. Thanks to her private teachers Pietro Orsi, Pompeo Molmenti, and Antonio Fradeletto, whose careers combined investment in art with political engagement, her education included significant exposure to art and art criticism. Despite her parents' social position, she became a committed socialist early on, in 1898 marrying the socialist lawyer Cesare Sarfatti, the member of another prosperous Venetian family. The Sarfattis moved to Milan in 1902, and about this time Margherita began her career as an art critic. In 1903, she was awarded a prize for her articles on the Fifth Venice Biennale, published in <i>Gazzetta degli Artisti </i>(Venice) and <i>La Patria </i>(Rome). From 1903 to 1908, Margherita contributed art criticism to such periodicals as <i>Avanti! </i>(Milan), <i>Avanti della Domenica </i>(Florence then Rome)<i>, L'Adriatico</i> (Ancona), <i>Varietas</i> (Milan), and the <i>Gazzetta di Venezia, </i>securing a regular post at the socialist daily <i>Avanti!</i> in 1908.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  These early years demonstrate the extent to which her thinking about art was from the beginning intertwined with her ideas about politics and social change.
</p>

<p>
Sarfatti's influence in the art world was greatly aided by her political and amorous involvement with Benito Mussolini. Mussolini was a rising star in the socialist party, and in December 1912, he took over the editorship of <i>Avanti!</i> This was the period in which Sarfatti first cemented her ties to the avant-gardes, and such res as Achille Funi, Leonardo Dudreville, Carlo Erba, and Antonio Sant'Elia became frequent guests of her salon.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Although they still identified themselves with futurism, Sarfatti saw in them the beginnings of a calmer classicizing trend in the modern movement. In 1914, she reviewed their "New Tendencies" exhibition for <i>Avanti!</i>, celebrating the work of Funi and Dudreville in a review that marks a transition in her career from being a mere observer of the art world to that of advocate and promoter.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As the political situation shifted&#x02014;in Italy in general, and in the socialist party in particular&#x02014;Sarfatti gained additional clout. In October 1914, Mussolini broke with the socialist party over the question of Italian neutrality in World War I: although the socialists opposed the war, he believed Italy should intervene. Sarfatti, too, jumped ship in the summer of 1915 and started publishing articles about contemporary art in <i>Il Popolo d'Italia,</i> the newspaper Mussolini founded in the immediate wake of his break with socialism. Her friendship with Mussolini intensified, and although their affair was on-again-off-again for many years, it grew more serious in the fall of 1918, at which time she became his principal advisor on cultural matters. The collaboration was cemented because Sarfatti's cultural objectives converged with Mussolini's political goals: he was committed to restoring social and economic order in Italy in the name of modernization; she sought to establish a school of artists whose work was at once modern and classicizing, invested in innovation and committed to a "return to order."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
By this time, both as a response to the war and to the rative turn marked by the work of Metaphysical school painters like Giorgio de Chirico, artists like Gino Severini, Mario Sironi, and Carlo Carr&#x000E0; were also drifting out of the futurist fold. They were gravitating towards various forms of modernist classicism, seeking to innovate through the modeling of simple forms and drawing their inspiration from early Renaissance artists such as Masaccio. Sarfatti was one of the catalysts of this classicizing turn and 

<b></b>

dreamed of a "second Italian Renaissance that would restore the supremacy of her nation's art and return the center of the art world from France to Italy." With Mussolini she co-edited <i>Ardita</i> (1919&#x02013;1921), conceived as the literary review of <i>Il Popolo d'Italia,</i> and later <i>Gerarchia </i>(1922&#x02013;1943).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  And during the early years of his regime, Sarfatti took an active role in educating Mussolini about the role that art could play in his vision of a politically revitalized Italy, encouraging him to study Machiavelli and the history of ancient Rome.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>
This new advocacy role thrust her into the world of public relations and patronage battles. In the spring of 1920, she fought successfully to gain entry for Achille Funi, Mario Sironi, and other modern Italian painters into the twelfth Venice Biennale, protesting their exclusion from the exhibition. From its foundation in 1895 until the mid-1920s, the Biennale had been a conservative affair; by 1914, it had become "a confirmed stop on the grand tours of an increasingly mobile bourgeoisie." In the early 1920s, Vittorio Pica brought modern European art&#x02014;especially French Post-Impressionist art&#x02014;into the Biennale, but the Italian artists represented remained conservative, academic painters

<b></b>

such as Ettore Tito, Telemaco Signorini, and Pietro Fragiacomo. To add insult to injury, during the first thirty or so years of the Biennali, there were nearly two foreign artists for every Italian artist.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Sarfatti's attempt to introduce modern Italian art into the Biennale succeeded: Pica offered exhibition space to a number of the artists she had championed.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  In this way Sarfatti became identified with a group of artists who soon came to call themselves the <i>Novecento italiano</i>. The name echoed art historians' use of the term <i>quattrocento</i> to describe such artists as Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, and Masaccio. The painters of the <i>Novecento</i> sought a distinctly Italian and Mediterranean road to modernity: one that embraced the new but animated by the same interplays of elementary forms and volumes found in early Renaissance masters. While Sarfatti did not tell them what direction to take in their art, she helped to shape the movement's identity.
</p>

<p>
After Mussolini assumed power in October 1922, Sarfatti brought additional attention to the <i>Novecento</i> by inviting Mussolini to speak at the openings of the group's exhibitions. At its first exhibition, in March 1923, Mussolini spoke of the interrelation between the art of politics and the politics of art. "I too am an artist," he declared, "who works a certain material and pursues certain determined ideals." He explained the state's responsibility to artists: "The state has a single duty: that is to not sabotage art, to create conditions humane to artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national points of view."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Some of the <i>Novecentisti </i>worried about the implications of Sarfatti's ties to Mussolini, as they did not want to be perceived as working openly for the fascist regime. Though Sarfatti would later reply that "fascist art" was not a product of the regime, but rather that "fascism and this form of art are born of a single rootstock," tensions mounted about who was in charge of the movement.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  By April 1924, the first incarnation of the <i>Novecento</i> collapsed as a result of the resignation of four members, including Leonardo Dudreville, Anselmo Bucci, and Gian Emilio Malerba.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Over time, however, these artists came to appreciate the value of Sarfatti's support and the <i>Novecento Italiano</i> was reborn in February 1925, at the instigation of Achille Funi. The new group included such prior members as Anselmo Bucci, Leonardo Dudreville, and Mario Sironi, but added to their ranks Carlo Carr&#x000E0;, Alberto Salietti, Arturo Tosi, and Adolfo Wildt. It mounted an exhibition at the Palazzo della Permanente in Milan from February to March 1926, and the participants' work showed a much greater stylistic range than had the original <i>Novecento</i> group. In addition to the <i>Novecentisti,</i> there were representatives of the Roman <i>Scuola Romana</i> (including Carlo Socrate and Primo Sinopico), second generation futurists (Fortunato Depero, Enrico Prampolini, and Luigi Russolo), representatives of the Florentine <i>strapaese</i> group (Ardengo Soffici, Libero Andreotti, Antonio Maraini), and artists no longer strictly affiliated with particular currents (such as Giorgio de Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, Cipriano Efisio Oppo, Gino Severini).<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This rebirth of the <i>Novecento</i> marked the beginning of Sarfatti's period of greatest cultural influence.
</p>

<p>
In 1925, the first edition of Sarfatti's biography, <i>The Life of Benito Mussolini</i>, was published in England. In June 1926, the Italian edition was published under the title <i>Dux,</i> the Latin form of <i>Duce</i>: a title that linked the cult of Mussolini to that of <i>romanit&#x000E0;</i> 

<b></b>

("romanness") in line with Sarfatti's and Mussolini's dream of remaking Rome "into the political and spiritual capital of a new fascist empire."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Sarfatti's husband Cesare died in 1924, and after spending much of 1926 in Rome, Sarfatti moved to the nation's capital in 1927, her proximity to Mussolini further strengthening her power and consecrating her policymaking role.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Sarfatti also encouraged Mussolini to found institutions to rejuvenate Italian culture. In 1926, he created the Royal Academy of Italy, and Sarfatti was widely thought to have chosen the first members.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Mussolini declared that the Academy would be "a vibrant center of national culture that augments and promotes the intellectual movement according to the genius and tradition of our people."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Members of the Academy included prominent res in the arts, humanities, and sciences, including Giovanni Gentile, Luigi Pirandello, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Guglielmo Marconi, Ottorino Respighi, and Enrico Fermi. They "received a stipend of 3,000 lire a month, three times the average shopkeeper's salary" and "[i]n exchange for subsidy, the regime required members to appear at public ceremonies wearing ornate fascist uniforms."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The Academy's activities included financing an attempt to rid the Italian language of foreign borrowing, establishing a State Record Library (<i>Discoteca dello Stato</i>) to preserve regional dialects and traditional songs, sponsoring conferences that drew important cultural personalities to Italy, and supporting revivals of the decorative arts. Its most important contributions to cultural production, however, were probably the grants and awards it sponsored, including the prestigious Mussolini Prize (<i>Premio Mussolini</i>). Recipients of this prize include Ada Negri and Emilio Cecchi; others, including Mario Mafai, Anna Maria Ortese, and Elio Vittorini received smaller "encouragement prizes" (<i>premi d'incoraggiamento</i>).
</p>

<p>
Over time, Sarfatti's ability to influence government policies and patronage practices diminished. In part, this came about due to personal jealousies within Mussolini's inner circle; in part, due to increasing concerns within certain conservative sectors of the fascist party regarding foreign and Jewish influence. Much of the art she advocated&#x02014;including the <i>Novecento</i> and Rationalism&#x02014;professed the value of <i>italianit&#x000E0; </i>("Italianness") but also identified itself with broader international currents, thereby drawing the wrath of ultranationalists. That Sarfatti was born a Jew was also a problem, though more often an unspoken than a spoken one given fascism's early rejection of anti-Semitism. Starting in the late 1920s, however, a small but increasingly influential segment of the regime and party began to invoke Judaism as a threat to Italian national identity. Although Sarfatti had converted to Catholicism in 1928, her Jewishness was still exploited by her opponents as a quick means of dismissal.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  And in January 1930, Mussolini's wife Rachele demanded that he end his affair with Sarfatti and that <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i> cease publishing her work, and he gradually acquiesced. The government's official cultural policies remained pluralistic in character, and even though the proponents of modernism won numerous victories, nativist voices were growing influential. As the 1930s progressed and Italy's partnership with Germany led to a series of steps culminating in the promulgation of Nazi-style racial laws in 1938, Sarfatti recognized that she must flee her homeland. She began to spend extended periods abroad, working for the Hearst 

<b></b>

newspapers in the US in the mid-1930s. On November 14, 1938, she departed Italy once and for all, without encountering any obstructions. Even if she exerted little influence over the fascist regime during its final decade, Sarfatti had left such an indelible mark that some would remember her as Mussolini's "dictator of culture."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This selection of pieces from <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i> follows the evolution of Sarfatti's thought between 1919 and 1926. The first is an abridged version of a three-part review of the Great National Futurist Exhibition, organized by Marinetti and held at the Central Gallery of Art in Milan from March 11&#x02013;April 30, 1919. It points out how the show actually marks a departure from futurism, and observes how artists like Sironi and Funi were working to restore "plastic values" to art, looking to an earlier period in which painting had been integral to architecture.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The second piece, published in February 1920, bemoans the lack of representation of members of the Italian avant-gardes at the 12th Venice Biennale. Because Sarfatti had begun her career writing about this international exhibition, the Biennale became the focal point of her critique of a contemporary arts scene on which modern Italian painting was neglected, while artists from across the Alps were granted prominence. This polemic represents the beginning of her successful campaign to bring recognition to the artistic and cultural innovations taking place in contemporary Italian art.
</p>

<p>
The third piece, published in April 1921, celebrates an exhibition of Italian paintings in Berlin, seizing the opportunity to call for a new art at once modern and rooted in Italian artistic tradition. The artists it embraces had rejected futurism's advocacy of a complete break with the past, choosing instead to look back to <i>quattrocento</i> art in the pursuit of a sober and elementary forms of ration. In so doing, their work resonated with Mussolini's general conviction that Italy's cultural heritage should provide the main basis for new artistic creation.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The fourth piece concerns the foundation of the Italian Royal Academy, formalized by a decree passed on January 7, 1926. Sarfatti's account of this institution's mission demonstrates the extent to which she believed in the state's responsibility to enrich the nation's culture through the sponsorship of artists, intellectuals, and scientists.
</p>

<p>
The values that Sarfatti championed in her essay on the April 1921 Berlin show provided the aesthetic grounds for the <i>Novecento</i> <i>italiano</i>, and her review of the latter's March 1926 exhibition is the fifth and final piece in this anthology. Richly illustrated, it was published in <i>La Rivista Illustrata di Il Popolo d'Italia,</i> a monthly supplement to the newspaper. It represents Sarfatti's most comprehensive account of this important show.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There are many strands of Sarfatti's work that are barely touched upon here. There is no trace of her contribution to building up the myth of Mussolini as <i>il Duce</i>. Nor are there indications of her frequent attention to the role of women in modern life. What these five pieces document, however, is Sarfatti's sustained effort to define modern Italy as a cultural nation.

I. Concerning Some General Principles (April 4, 1919)
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
First, art is not the reproduction of reality. Painting has nothing to do with photography.
</p>

<p>
These are commonplace, obvious truths, and in stating them one risks making a pitiful show of oneself in front of individuals of less than mediocre intelligence. But if we analyze how most of them understand these principles, we notice at once that the essential core of these so-called truisms is a truth still hard to grasp for the common mind.
</p>

<p>
Compromise has always pleased the public.
</p>

<p>
Water tends naturally to run downhill; and the human mind, just as naturally, follows the same law of minimal effort. But, by fortunate contradiction, there is also a child in us who is eager to see the newest thing, to play with an unfamiliar toy. Men thus express great gratitude to whoever presents them with what is already seen and known, seasoned with a savvy, pleasing dose of obvious and superficial novelty. The mind exerts no effort to acclimate itself to an essentially familiar environment, while the eye is delighted by the distraction of a brilliant new thing that proves quickly accessible and readily assimilable. In painting and, more generally, in the plastic arts, commercial success has been achieved by those who know how to reproduce the common features of reality with an illusionism that only slightly and superficially diverges from photography, especially by softening a re and smoothing distinctive angles and harsh edges.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
On the contrary, the avant-garde painting and sculpture of today doesn't even bother to reproduce a man, woman, watermelon, or dog in the rigid photographic manner of ordinary vision. Hence the anger of the public: a revolt founded upon mental sluggishness and deep disorientation.
</p>

<p>
Why might this be?
</p>

<p>
Painting and sculpture were the handmaidens of a greater unifying art throughout the solemn centuries of austere unity and hierarchy that were the Middle Ages and throughout all previous centuries: namely, architecture. At a certain inevitable point, the architectural tree was destined to blossom with more graceful, subtle, and fragile plastic rations: the architrave, the metope, the capital, the spire, bas-relief garlands. Sharpened and glorified, these ornaments culminated in statues.
</p>

<p>
Painting&#x02014;frescos, mosaics, altarpieces&#x02014;came to inscribe itself in the flat spaces and to reveal its significance and value in rhythmic lines and luminous colors.
</p>

<p>
What did the overly-praised Renaissance do? It set canvases standing on solitary easels. Worse still, it uprooted statues from their necessary and logical architectural setting.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The disciplines of painting and sculpture developed over too many centuries and millennia for grace to abandon them all at once. Architectural and exterior stylistic needs continued to leave a rhythmic mark on their inner architecture: consciously so in great works; unconsciously so in minor counterparts. But during this long era of anarchic wandering, little by little, the sense and synthesis of stylistic logic became obscured and obliterated.
</p>

<p>
As always, when substance runs short, it is replaced by sticking blindly and fanatically to formulae. Ritual and superstition are born out of destiny's rubble and ashes.
</p>

<p>
So developed the academicism and the rigid schematics of neo-classicism. And, as a reaction, came the Romanticism of Delacroix and the realism of Courbet, to sweep clean the terrain. They flowed as a river does toward its mouth, into the magnificent anarchic impetuosity of impressionism and post-impressionism.
</p>

<p>
With post-impressionism (Seurat, Signac, Pissarro), the process of fragmentation and molecular decomposition to which the great constructive unity of painting was subjected reached its apex, resulting in the breakdown of surface colored planes into splintered rainbow shards with the stroke of a Divisionist brush.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Analysis in painting has already produced everything that could be expected.
</p>

<p>
With Paul C&#x000E9;zanne, not by chance a Frenchman of Italian origin, begins the age and the classical task of undertaking a great synthetic reconstruction.
</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
There is still plenty of confusion and chaos, plenty of hasty mucking up of commonly accepted notions regarding art. Among artists themselves (those who have ideas) and even among avant-garde painters, there are many who in their efforts to define this movement still struggle to understand their own aims. Perhaps more than a few of them believe that they inhabit a realm of unbridled and unprecedented individual freedom. And perhaps they are offended to be assigned to a "school": a label that smacks of reproach and suggests a lesser reputation.
</p>

<p>
They are mistaken. "School" does not mean the elimination of individual artistic personality. Those endowed with more intelligence and more subtle and robust sensitivity emerge, and will always emerge, from the pack. But it does mean coordination and collaborative effort.
</p>

<p>
The lyrical composition and decomposition of form, which these avant-gardist tendencies champion, may also mislead them. In reality, these formal operations are permissible only so long as, serving the higher interests of art, they become the necessary components of a more solemn recovery of uniform synthesis.
</p>

<p>
These laws of balance and proportion, these secrets of stylistic composition by means of which individual talent flowers and grafts itself upon the musical and geometrical rhythms of profound and spontaneous destiny in diverse forms and for diverse reasons: all the great epochs knew this secret of the grand style. We now stand on the verge of a radical revision of artistic values. So the challenge faced in today's fervid vigil is to 

<b></b>

rediscover this secret according to the intimate and essential laws of internal development, not according to the external contours of a nonexistent architecture that is still in swaddling clothes.
</p>

<p>
The duty of the Italian art of today and tomorrow will perhaps be that of rising to this task, successfully carrying out this mission.

II. Concerning Some Painters (April 10, 1919)
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p>
Funi, Sironi, Russolo, Dudreville&#x02014;all are painters already known to the public&#x02014;and, among the younger and still unknown, Baldassari, Rosai, Primo Conti; and the witty and amusing decorator Depero; as well as a sculptor of unexpected grace like Palafacchina: how many exhibitions have taken place in Milan or, for that matter, in Italy, that bring together such an abundance of serious and authentic artistic authorities?<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The public does well to swarm about the exhibition every day. Not everyone understands, but many discuss and some reflect. It is quite something.
</p>

<p>
I am not referring to pseudo-intellectual connoisseurs, brimming over with cultural foolishness, but rather to the arrogant experts who holler despite the total lack of understanding of the plastic arts, their form, style, or time period. I speak for the genuine public, free from pretexts and preconceptions, which attends the exhibition in order to make an honest effort to understand. This public might well be more able to grasp the intimate substance of the artworks exhibited if it could be persuaded that there is no need for wholesale acceptance of all of futurism.
</p>

<p>
The "puzzle alphabets" [<i>alfabeti a sorpresa</i>], for example, are considered an ingenious and amusing variation of the <i>rebuses</i> and anagrams already in vogue in the venerable puzzle magazines.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The <i>Portrait of the Marchesa Casati</i> by Giacomo Balla&#x02014;amusing and extremely faithful as a portrait with its complicated structures of wood, glass, and sparkling tinfoil&#x02014;represents little more than the elaboration of an ephemeral, elegant, and ingenious toy: an artistic plaything, if you wish, but without the construction of a work of art.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
To claim that every one of the thirty plus artists in this exhibition of Italian avant-garde painting was an exceptional talent would be misleading. Some of them are. Better (because more serious and honest) to acknowledge that not all the works of even the best artists are completely successful. Even the most seasoned painter-cooks [<i>pittori-cuochi</i>] are not always skilful in varying the unpublished recipes they prepare for the public. Sometimes they stumble along even well-trodden paths. The risk is greatest for the courageous explorers of unfamiliar paths, for those who seek out traces of ancient forgotten streets or try to pry open new passages toward horizons of unfamiliar sensitivity. But for them, unlike the exploiters of tried and true formulas, some fertile leads may result in the process (even by dint of error). Glory may well be achieved even through failure.

Why then insist on the fate and name of an exhibitor who brings the mild fanaticism of his own mediocrity to art or who is filled with good will, at once obstinate and disparate, or gives evidence of a disinterested and respectable but unfortunate love of painting?
</p>

<p>
Funi, Russolo, Dudreville, Sironi: these four well deserve to have people lingering before their art works, together with the other two or three already named. (One might perhaps add the names of Giudici, Lega, Venna, and other younger men to the list, if only they could be judged on the basis of more or more substantial works.)<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

Asia is very present in the chromatic schemes and assemblages of the set painter Fortunato Depero: the Asia of Persian and Chinese miniatures interpreted through the Russia of L&#x000E9;on Bakst and the ballets of Diaghilev, and especially through the corpulent and gargantuan burst of Mikhail Larionov's mock-heroic laughter. There is a little of Adolphe Sturzwage's dissective cubism in his compositions, a bit of Larionov, again, and a bit of Sironi in his conception of the human form, squared off in great masses and geometric planes.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  I prefer his little drawings in black and white, where he reveals, especially in the representations of animals, a solid sense of mass, and a purity of line in the manner of Pisanello.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
An interior nocturnal scene in a tavern or an elegant night club also succeed in being pleasant and tasteful, decorated with the tumultuous and not discordant uproar of the flat hues and lively colors of which he is fond, done deliberately to prompt a desire for the distractions and fleeting gaiety and forgetfulness of the moment.

Let's be clear: the true colorist doesn't cling to and accumulate colors in the name of a sort of orgiastic, Dionysian insatiability. Rather, the profound colorist is an Apollonian for whom, for example, a chord of grays, broken and exalted by sobbing improvised reds or by a serene glitter of blues is enough to provoke and satisfy vibrations of intense voluptuousness.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this refined and authentic sense, Sironi is a formidable colorist. The quality of his grays is an acute innovation, delicate and balanced in tonal values, which I would not hesitate to define as classical. (Do you recall the intoxicating sobriety of the intense coloration in Raphael's <i>Transration</i>?)
</p>

<p>
Let's take the case of Sironi's <i>Group of Houses&#x02014;Night,</i> and his <i>Dancer</i>, and <i>Lady in the Rain</i>. It is difficult to explain in words the nostalgic preciousness and precise harmony of the moderate golden tones, of the shadows, and the cool whites and blacks. He knows how to juggle these elements without affectation or mannerism, placing special emphasis on the contrast between the delicacy of color and a powerful sense of force, verging on brutality, in the treatment of form.

</p>

<p>
Here are the sketches for <i>Il Montello,</i> newspaper of the trenches, with such audacious elasticity of spirit, founded and directed by Massimo Bontempelli:<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  <i>Guglielmone on a Horse</i> is stylized through a succession of massive planes, themselves stylized and exemplified, like a monument of Assyrian sculpture.
</p>

<p>
Next comes <i>The Cyclist</i>. Its edge is blue as the sky. Rectilinear apartments are cut by the rectangular geometry of windows. In the middle of the street, under a bored and immortal solitary street lamp, a rolling person arrives: a rapid flash of form in synthesis and in movement; the cyclist, light and formidable, wheels and muscles, spinning rays and curved body. His handlebar and hat shine in the sun.
</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Another approach to form, another sensibility, another unitary synthesis of movement can be found in the work of Achille Funi. This young painter moves fluently and quickly towards his target with a clear sense of direction, a wonderful simplicity, and an unwavering will not to allow himself either to disturb or to slow down his journey with sentimental detours towards the past. He has the robust, square shoulders of the pioneer who never gets exasperated or lost in minor details, but instead moves cleanly and firmly "in medias res."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Funi is the artist in this group who seems to be setting out with the fewest hesitations and uncertainties, with a distinctive emphasis on concise and sober energy, towards definitive expressions of his personal style.
</p>

<p>
Look at the pleats of the tablecloth and the objects on the table in <i>Family at the Table</i>; and at the characteristic deformation of heads under the diffuse light raining down from a lamp. And then consider <i>Construction of a Woman</i> and above all, the <i>Motorcyclist</i>: a work I would not call perfect and definitive, but certainly fully self-sufficient. It leaves behind the realm of experimentation to dig deep into the core of its own unmistakable vital force. Never before has the graphic and plastic synthesis of movement been captured by means of such firm and precise lines. Funi has summed up the sight of the motorbike with the greatest simplicity. The sky-blue haziness of the air that palpitates and cools down in bluish hues around the hub of the wheels. The speed of the wheels themselves establishes an elliptical spiral for our eyes. The rider's head is reduced to a mere pink-colored oval. The painter has implied all the particulars by means of solid lines and supple color, forcing the viewer to guess.
</p>

<p>
Achille Funi solved these arduous and ultradelicate problems with a firm sense of modern beauty, of precision and elegance that is both modern and classical.

2. The Italian Artistic Avant-garde and Invitations to the Venice <i>Biennale</i> (February 29, 1920)
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Matisse, in front; and just behind him, quite a few other Frenchmen from audaciously innovative movements; not to mention Van Gogh, Gauguin, and C&#x000E9;zanne: great names, great works so dense with meaning that even hallowed death and the passage of time could not blunt their combative and hard-fought pictorial modernity. It is said that these will be the artists for whom the doors of the next Venice Art <i>Biennale</i> will open.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps owing more to circumstances than to his personal faults, Antonio Fradeletto had recently allowed Venice's periodic art exhibitions to come under the dominion of a gang of mediocre officials from various countries.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Vittorio Pica succeeded Fradeletto as Secretary General of Exhibitions. He seems to have gone to Paris in the mode of an indebted subject to freshen up the shabby canvases and statues of the foreign pavilions, which had become rather like fireplace trimmings.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The same can be said of Switzerland regarding its individual exhibitions of the work of painters Buri and Hodler.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="noIndent">
France, and even Switzerland. But Italy?
</p>

<p>
Oh, Italy! In Venice, Versailles-style, one might think that Italy is a <i>quantit&#x000E9; n&#x000E9;gligeable.</i>
</p>

<p>
We have&#x02014;I do not mind repeating it forcefully for those who find it comforting, even chic to continue snobbishly to ignore it&#x02014;we have, thank God, avant-garde art in Italy.
</p>

<p>
Can you explain why, amidst all the avant-garde and innovative art from other countries, we have allowed Italy to be forgotten? Or rather, did we deliberately decide to ignore and exclude Italy?
</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="noIndent">
Evidently there is no real reason why invitations are extended to foreigners who have already achieved wealth, among other things, due to their access to an audience 

<b></b>

more vast and cosmopolitan, more lively, shrewd, moneyed, and flexible, like that found in a city like Paris. Why, I say, are such enormous opportunities offered to foreigners, while innovative Italian artists have to face the expense, risk, and uncertainty of submitting their work for the verdict of a jury? The very artists whose honorable and often heroic struggles against poverty, against a public smothered under a blanket of opaque indifference, and against so-called "connoisseurs" and critics, armed with a sneer of stilted incomprehension and malicious derision, are legion. What justice or recognition might ever be expected from our usual juries? Italian artists have good reason to refuse&#x02014;they do so energetically&#x02014;the humiliation and degradation of this disparity in treatment, which works to their detriment.
</p>

<p>
Yet there are Italian invitees to the coming 1920 <i>Biennale</i> and their numbers are far from negligible. Who are they? The usual familiar and mostly rancid names and, in addition, numerous "youth," by only those who have been "tamed."
</p>

<p>
Pomi is one of them. He is a Venetian who remakes Ettore Tito timidly and cunningly by moonlight, with more pettiness and less high-class smoothness. In the postwar year 1920, can you imagine a Petrarchan whose Petrarch is named Ettore Tito?<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't hesitate to state that if the Venice <i>Biennial</i> goes forward as currently planned and if its guiding lights do not aim for more balanced, reasonable, and healthy outcome, it will be the most disastrous assault on Italian art that has ever occurred on Italian soil.
</p>

<p>
Until present, the Venice <i>Biennali</i> maintained a staid, and in a certain sense, traditional appearance, at once routine and official: "traditional" not in the sense of any true and great tradition. One could deplore the event, but it at least remained consistent and, given its unilateral tendencies, it maintained a certain uniformity of impartial balance among countries. It was, in this respect at least, unassailably correct and honest. Today that is no longer the case.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The Venice <i>Biennali</i> are not the drawing-room or private homes of the Secretary Generals who have directed them over the years, where they can give free reign to their personal likes and dislikes.
</p>

<p>
They are, instead, public undertakings, conducted and subsidized by the public expenditure of cities and the state. With the money, that is, of the Italian taxpayer. Therefore, a rigid and objective criteria and impartiality are among the key qualities required of whoever directs them.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the Secretary harbors sympathies for avant-garde Italian art matters little with respect to his duty to invite representative artists. From the moment he drops the veil of modest reserve towards the art of the combative extreme of France's left, with what right can he exclude from the list of invited artists <i>Italians in the land of Italy</i> whose effort is essentially synchronous and parallel with that of their foreign brethren?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Artists like Carr&#x000E0;, Sironi, Funi, Soffici, Dudreville, Depero, Russolo, Severini, De Chirico, Balla, have every right to enter through the front door of an exhibition whose doors are thrown open to the likes of Henri Matisse.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  This is no longer a question of art, but of common sense and simple rectitude on the part of an official who is, after all, the administrator of someone else's money. Accordingly, he is not permitted to spend such monies according to his own private whims, demonstrating partiality to some&#x02014;whether great foreign artists or tame little local darlings&#x02014;and hostility to others.
</p>

<p>
The long and painful experiences of modern history should have taught us something, given the systematic repudiation by official exhibitions, galleries, and museums, of works of art recognized later for their artistic merit, originality, and great significance. It is high time that men belonging to the establishment learn modesty and stop claiming that they possess infallible judgment. This system has made too many outrageous errors on too many occasions. The problem isn't with the not-so-illuminated preferences of individual director Joe Blow [<i>Tizio</i>] or his secretary John Doe [<i>Caio</i>].<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>   We are resigned to bad choices; they are inevitable. (<i>Axiom: A successful man is inevitably a man who has been surpassed</i>.) It is <i>choice</i> itself that we, of course, deplore: the right that some men claim for themselves to referee trends, fashions, and artistic schools.
</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Does avant-garde painting exist in Italy today?
</p>

<p>
This is the question; the only real question that a man presiding over an institution like the Venice <i>Biennale</i> should have the right to pose. This art exists. It has been around now for years and shown a vital tenacity and undeniable combativeness. Who are its greatest, most famous, and influential exponents?
</p>

<p>
These are the questions that it is right and proper to pose. Whether the honorable secretary is subsequently free to shrug his shoulders and declare that the work of these artists is idiotic, empty, or execrable, matters not. He is entirely free, as a critic, to berate them or ignore them, reserving his enthusiasm for such an innovator as Edoardo Dalbono.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  No one questions his nor his successors' freedom of taste, good or bad though it may be.
</p>

<p>
What we formally contest&#x02014;we hope to have a minority on our side made up of the most lively and sensitive individuals who deserve to be taken seriously by the press and by Italy's intelligent and impartial artists, even those who are not innovative&#x02014;is the right to deny avant-garde Italian artists the possibility of proving themselves in the presence of a large Italian and international public. All the more so in an exhibition in which one grants this very right to a Frenchman like Henri Matisse, who is no less violently abhorred, ignored, and decried in France by the official art world than are Funi or Sironi, Soffici, or Dudreville among Italians.

3. Letter from Berlin: An Affirmation of Italian Art  (April 30, 1921)
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
A splendid affirmation of new trends in Italian plastic and pictorial art recently took place in Berlin, thanks to the initiative and merit of Mario Broglio, who organized a rich and organic exhibition of the leading artists of the Roman journal <i>Valori Plastici</i> at the <i>Kronprinz Palais</i>.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The journal's work hinges on such names as Carr&#x000E0;, Picasso, de Chirico, Soffici, Melli, Morandi, and Archipenko and requires little in the way of illustrations. It is one of the most agreeable and significant artistic forces combatting "the illusion of novelty."
</p>

<p>
Through a curious paradox, the very names that were previously leading the charge in favor of various artistic "-isms" are today leading the turn towards pure classicism. They are lining up against the theories of Monet that preach that painting should limit itself to soliciting the sensuality of the eye. Instead they are exploring the supreme harmony of mass, the profound refinement of an ensemble of well-constructed forms.
</p>

<p>
The theatrical mannerisms of Impressionism, Cubism, dynamism, . . . "fanfarism," led art to forget charm and softness, and to replace the picturesque and the lyrical with the grotesque and the simplistic. By returning to the painting of an earlier era, to its uncertain virginity, to its faithful imitation of visual reality, what is lost in outward appearance will be regained in substance, spiritual composure, power, and nobility.
</p>

<p>
Italian art must return to method, order, and discipline. It must achieve a definite, full-bodied form, a precise sense of gravity, analogous to and convergent with that of the ancients; independent of foreign fashions and mercantile considerations.
</p>

<p>
Originality and tradition are not contradictory terms. By returning to the purest traditions of Giottos, Masaccios, Paolo Uccellos, one does not renounce the originality of modern times, but only polishes off the rust and purifies our art of imitative alloys.
</p>

<p>
This is the philosophy, the spiritual program of the new school, conveyed in the Berlin exhibition by names like de Chirico, Francalancia, Morandi, Carr&#x000E0;, Martini, and Zur-Muehlen.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The largest number of works in the show are by De Chirico. He stands out for his rough boldness, his return to tradition, his attempt to achieve classicism by means of geometric technique. He is the first intrepid re to abandon modern curves. Being the first, it was perhaps inevitable that he should fall prey to the original sin of imitative mannerism.
</p>

<p>
Morandi, on the other hand, is the poet of form; an Italian spirit saturated with kindness. With rustic grace, ingenuous and fresh, he practices the art of color in order to approach nature. His still lifes are without a doubt the most beautiful objects in the exhibition.
</p>

<p>
As always, Carr&#x000E0; is powerful but is too philosophical-critical to be spontaneous and lyrical at the same time. His works are more interesting as profound studies of a dramatic state of mind than as the products of a pictorial instinct.
</p>

<p>
With a variety of canvases and sculptures, Francalancia, Zur-Muehlen, Martini, and Zabbrine complete the small world of new Italian art: a world that has captured the 

<b></b>

interest of the entire Berlin arts community and confirmed that our awakening knows no boundaries. Rather, its light is radiating in all directions.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

4. Promises and Actions: The Italian Academy (January 15, 1926)
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
"Having faced problems of necessity and moved them toward resolution, I have turned my attention to addressing questions of greatness." This is how the head of the Government [Mussolini] responded to a heated appeal from the National Board of Directors of the Corporation of the Plastic Arts on 27 October of last year.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  In so doing, he took on the obligation of placing himself at the head of a grand and energetic crusade for the benefit of modern art. After the Battle for Grain, less urgent but no less necessary is a campaign for modern art.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The speech given last December 31 lays the groundwork for one of the first challenges of greatness: building the new Rome.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Respect ancient Rome, restore it, and leave as much of its noble space intact as possible. The crowd, that dense and shameless human swarm gathering at the foot of the city's ruins, has beautiful and sacred vital needs that cannot be ignored. But respond to them by means of an appropriate, freshly built place, so that the new city and the old can coexist in harmony, with a variety of interconnections (narrow, dignified, majestic) between the two.
</p>

<p>
When France took over Tunis in 1885 (where we Italians should have been&#x02014;alas for us!), everything worked just as it should. Not a single stone was demolished in the ancient Arab city core, which was left serene and secure in all its local color. Even the smallest of picturesque and artistic delights found themselves safe behind the ancient walls of the <i>souk </i>and the <i>Casbah </i>(the castle). But outside the ancient city, toward the harbor, a new city was born: a city free and spacious, with wide tree-lined avenues and large open-plan houses designed according to western concepts of airiness, light, hygiene, and creature comfort. The old was not maliciously sacrificed to the new. Nor was the new twisted, altered, and falsified into the ancient.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
According to Theodor Mommsen, second only to the great historians of the Empire (Titus, Suetonius, and Tacitus) in his understanding of the spirit of imperial Rome, Rome can only be considered as a universal idea.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  For this same reason, the idea of the empire&#x02014;today less a material reality than a consolidated spiritual ideal-in-the-making&#x02014;flashes in the consciousness of fascism like a profound intuition.
</p>

<p>
This imperial unity of Italy's soul and self-awareness is also evoked and promised in the recent decree announcing the foundation of the Italian Academy. At issue is not an imitation or a servile and unoriginal (and, therefore, useless) copy of the French Academy, conceived of by Cardinal Richelieu three centuries ago [ . . . ].<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  Rather, what is envisaged will be similar to the Institut de France, graced by the genius of Richelieu, Mazarin, Colbert, and the French Convention in the course of its history, where, thanks to the recognition accorded the visual arts alongside the scientific disciplines, creation was consecrated as the key to the life of the spirit.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Still at its infancy in the seventeenth century, science today impregnates our entire lives, not only with 

<b></b>

its findings, inventions, and discoveries (whether in the fields of the physical sciences or mechanical applications), but also thanks to the vaster, more rigorous forms and methods with which it infuses contemporary thought. Accordingly, the Academy of the fatherland of Galileo and Leonardo will be composed <i>ex aequo</i> of twenty scientists, twenty artists, and twenty men of letters.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Italy achieved greatness when there were thirty centers of lively, impassioned, intelligent, and energetic work in the sciences, the arts, and letters among its universities and among the courts of its magnificent rulers. Then, because there were too many centers or because they declined, so too did the arts, sciences, and letters. And Rome was no longer the capital. And no other city or center achieved the decisive, crucial importance of Versailles, Paris, or London. So much so, that Italy's artistic and literary capital lay beyond the Alps for the entire nineteenth century. From Paris came the Word as well as fashion.
</p>

<p>
Why so? Above all, because the difference between sleep-inducing provinces and a capital that energizes is determined by the vital importance that is attributed (or not attributed) to the idea of art, to problems of culture and beauty, of the spirit and of ideas.
</p>

<p>
It is essential that, between a dance and a glass of champagne, the bejeweled lady and the elegant gentleman speak of art and literature; that the industrial tycoon feel obliged to discuss these matters with his colleagues and tablemates at the annual banquet of his management board; that [ . . . ] the banker and his wife, and the banker's mistress, as well as the suitors of the banker and his wife, assess the value of fashionable paintings, statues, books with no less zeal than they do the value of financial undertakings at the exchange [ . . . ] Why not? Isn't it essential that every lady from the provinces, every Madame Bovary thirsty for love and its elegant accompaniments, be made aware of certain names and certain works, or that every coarse merchant of silkworm cocoons, grain, or oxen feels obliged to demonstrate an interest in these matters if he wants to complete a sale when an important city client comes to visit?<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Fashion, artifice, vanity fair, snobbery? Certainly, they play a role. Art and literature&#x02014;all things of the spirit including the general principles of science&#x02014;must become objects of snobbery and fashion in order to become basic necessities, as fundamental as they are widespread. It is right and good that Baudelaire exalted Brummel and dandyism.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  Snobbery has a sovereign duty to create the atmosphere that, in turn, informs the intellectual environment. Every posture is the confession and profession of an ideal. Anything goes so long as it conforms to the ideal. Errant judgments, dilettantism, superficiality? Of course, they all abound. Each real achievement implies a decline, a violation: the desecration of an unsullied ideal. But an ideal becomes fecund, which is to say vital, only thanks to this contamination. Virgins enclosed within solitary convents are deprived of the glory of maternity.
</p>

<p>
Something of this flurry of action, turmoil, and expanding interest is already evident in Italy so far as ancient art is concerned. Suffice it to compare today's atmosphere with that of forty or even twenty years ago. How many collectors were there then? Today, there are legions. The much mocked war-profiteering was useful in this regard. One 

<b></b>

may think little of buying books "by the meter" to furnish study shelves or imitations of art works by the kilo for libraries and salons. But at least they were buying. And to buy means to become engaged. The book, once acquired, finds its pages cut and leafed through. One begins to read, to get comfortable with books. One develops the habit of looking at a painting and begins to build a natural familiarity with the work. After all, those who have made something from nothing and learned how to hold onto their wealth are no imbeciles. Taste is formed and refined by dint of looking and buying, by dressing up one's opinions and tastes in money, by endorsing the opinions and tastes of one's advisors, by dint of committing blunders. How many similar (and sometimes celebrated) shifts from initial crude and tentative first steps to shrewd and clever decision making, have we seen rapidly unfold before our very own eyes?
</p>

<p>
Now, what happened to the market for Titians and for more or less authentic antiques and furniture needs to extend to modern art. Illegitimate counterfeits of true intelligence, true talent, true modern genius will triumph initially. I am well aware that all human works are imperfect and defective. But woe betide he who would limit us to negation and inertia because of this acknowledged and uncontested imperfection of humankind.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to overcome this impasse.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to have faith.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to t.
</p>

<div class="center">

To t so long as one can do battle, whether this means fencing, a duel, or facing machine-gun fire. To t seriously, gloriously, authentically, amidst the clangor of arms, under the tense and impassioned attention of judges!! To do battle with swords or cannons or even against windmills is a marvelous risk or at least an amusing adventure. But to perpetually bang one's head against the same deaf punching bag of indifference, ironic insensitivity, and materialistic skepticism: such unfortunately has been our lot over the last fifty years: a mortifying undertaking, a labor of lunatics that leads to mad fury or dejected atony and mortal inertia.
</p>

<p>
The greatest merit of futurism was that it jolted this public indifference twenty years ago with the force of its fists (and not only metaphorically so).<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  It is necessary to keep today's public awake in a positive, sustained manner by less drastic means.
</p>

<p>
An Academy's appointments yield multiple results. They breed hopes and disappointments, aspirations and ambitions, intrigues, applause, and condemnation. The prizes that it confers&#x02014;both those that it actually confers and those that it refuses&#x02014;provide a superb showcase that magnetically attracts all eyes. It is a hearth, a center of interest, a perpetual subject of conversation.
</p>

<p>
Too many people busy themselves with politics, with the conceited incompetence of big words mastered by none, assembling in too many workshops as well as in less open gatherings. To discuss art, science, or letters, it is necessary to have at least read something more than just the news. The art of a man of state, ruler, and shepherd of 

<b></b>

the people, does not consist in suffocating human nature (which will always avenge itself) but instead in channeling that nature toward higher or more fruitful outlets. The Italian Academy represents a formidable step toward the worship of culture, ideas in general, deeds of the spirit, moral events and conquests. It represents a formidable push toward the precise and concise study of disciplines&#x02014;even the most high, the most ideal of disciplines&#x02014;always approached with a scrupulous respect for technique and even love. (I employ the word "love" even at the risk of having dispensed it too lightly and easily).
</p>

<p>
Verbal bombast and mental sloth&#x02014;passions more closely intertwined than one might expect because the <i>bluff</i> of maximum result is always sought via minimal effort&#x02014;continue to poison Italian life. They have unleashed themselves without restraint in the domain of political theory on a terrain that is at once subjective and arbitrary. What if one were to discuss these general topics in greater depth, topics for which serious preparation is indispensable?

The path to the summit of thought and creation in the sciences, letters, and arts is arduous and fraught with sacrifices. The more one climbs unexplored paths, the smaller the number of men capable of following such a path, of comprehending it, of judging it. This exile from the hot, noisy communion of sheep into the rapture of great solitude is harsh. So easy, by contrast, is the inertia and make-do attitude that accepts any and all outcomes, that avoids the distilling process implied by great effort sustained by personal drive [<i>talentaccio</i>] (something the superficial and the simpleminded, always the majority, dismiss as mere "spontaneity"). The frozen thin air of high altitudes freezes and rarefies the enthusiasms of the majority, unprepared for work that is to be endured and enjoyed profoundly. That air is the bearer of the new.
</p>

<p>
Who would tackle such hardship&#x02014;the mocking of fools, poverty, the jests of the rich, and the long delay in achieving recognition&#x02014;if he were not sustained by a sense of the vital importance and urgent necessity of his own work? This can come only from the self. But to stimulate and sustain this longing for betterment, to t off discouragement and the lure of desertion, requires an inner circle of initiates able to appreciate the effort and to nourish it [ . . . ] For this inner circle, the more formally recognized and consecrated its authority, the greater its impact on the general public and the latter's judgment.
</p>

<p>
Even the Academy will sometimes make mistakes (though it will not always err). But its errors will translate a higher logic and reason into the realm of deeds and ideas. Even its potential errors will provoke discussions, explanations, and passions of the highest usefulness.
</p>

<p>
But keep in mind that one of Florence's neighborhoods was long ago dubbed "Village of the Merry" [<i>"Borgo Allegri"</i>] because a minor painter and former shepherd had painted a beautiful Madonna that the people carried triumphantly through the city streets! Those people sensed that the life of Italy depends upon its art. A Madonna

both human and divine sundered the shackles of inert rigidity. And Italian life suddenly shone under the sunlight of a new grandeur.

<p>
It is this atmosphere of sensitivity and passion and sharing that we now require.

5. At the First Exhibition of the <i>Novecento Italiano</i> (March 1926)<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
There was a true Italian art in the <i>trecento </i>(which still exists), the <i>quattrocento,</i> the <i>cinquecento</i>. Then came the eclipse. The <i>seicento</i> was all Spanish, Flemish, and Dutch, and, eventually, French. Artistic hegemony in the <i>settecento</i> and <i>ottocento</i> was in the hands of English and French citizens.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A secret premonition tells us that the <i>novecento</i> will once again be a century of Italian art. This premonition was born with the men and women who came to life in the first decade of the century. They were the grandchildren of the great generation that made modern Italy: the children of a discouraged and relatively inert generation [ . . . ]. Hypnotized by German <i>Realpolitik</i> between 1870 to 1900, their immediate descendents treated the most active and worthy workers to nothing but bitterness, while allowing the cunning to busy themselves with rhetoric and commerce.
</p>

<p>
"Faith is the substance of hope" and a strong and secure premonition of greatness in the spirit of those mysterious diviners known as artists. When faith spreads and becomes universal, it is already in and of itself the reason and cause for greatness to come, affirming its purpose, expressing its promise.
</p>

<p>
The phrase <i>Novecento italiano</i> isn't intended to define a tendency or to christen a group or to bind together a school or a sect. The label denotes a proud striving toward the creation of a singular style of art or living visage for the new century that gathers together all of Italy's strengths: an imprint, a style, a distinctive Italian face that can endure for centuries. As if the members of a militia, these artists dedicated themselves with tireless love to creating a new tradition worthy of Italy's ancient past.
</p>

<p>
The exhibition that the Head of Government inaugurated a few days ago in Milan is the first attempt to sound the roll call of this new militia. The call is crucial inasmuch as it will ensure that the lead cohort senses itself united, compact, endowed with courage, and emboldened. If nineteenth-century French art was so much more daring than ours, the reason was Italy's lack of a feverish focal point, a hearth heated by risk and bold ideas. Our artists toiled in isolation. Their efforts were scattered into the void, disappearing without an echo. Often they pulled back, discouraged, into their own shells to flounder and grope in the darkness. The result was some works of singular intimacy and deep interiority. Yet they lacked systematic construction and were without consequence. There were stupendous fragments, but never a great edifice. At least one of them&#x02014;Fattori or Ranzoni, Grandi or Cremona, or the young Medardo Rosso when he still resided in Milan?&#x02014;uncovered a patch of the heavens but never managed to open a path on earth either for themselves or for others.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="noIndent">
The first exhibition of the <i>Novecento italiano</i> starts off with homage to the pioneers of the late <i>ottocento</i> with a retrospective of the work of Medardo Rosso: those unfortunate pioneers who, at best, received belated recognition in their fatherland. Medardo Rosso had to leave for France in order to find work, struggle, and glory. Only now does he return among us, fatigued by the many years of difficulties. And still he is appreciated only by a few.
</p>

<p>
His is an art of sensitivity, it is often said. Certainly, sensitivity plays a major role in his work. But within him there is austere courage, science, and profound experience, all of which permit him to give clear expressions to his sensitivity. He rejects all that is ornament and filler, sticking rigorously to his first direct impression. That's why he still adheres to an extreme type of impressionism. He rejects as inferior and detestable any and all art that subjects the genius's pure acts of intuition and deep feelings to the labor of intellect and willful elaboration.
</p>

<p>
This has nothing to do with laziness. Here lies the knot that differentiates Rosso from actual and eventual imitators. They cultivate hermetic airs yet traffic in what is facile. Rosso contemptuously rejects the facile, which is to say all secondary and exterior products of mere technique, in order to excavate and closely scrutinize the deep feelings that he brings to the surface from the depths of a trembling mysterious spring with remarkable artistic delicacy. There is something medium-like in the apparitions that he evokes by means of wax or bronze. But nothing unsteady. To an attentive spectator, the mystery of the spirit is captured by means of the play of light in the material, by means of definite, concrete, and certain signs [<i>segni</i>]: signs that, for all their distinctiveness, remain as still as those of a Donatello.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  The sublime head of the <i>Ecce Puer,</i> especially, is as great as an Egyptian sculpture from the era of the Pharaohs. Like that ancient art, it omits all superfluous things and homes in on the essential.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Between an artist like Medardo Rosso and one like Adolfo Wildt, the divide is great.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Wildt's art refuses to host corners of mystery or shadow. Where Rosso barely grazes the wax with an almost feminine delicacy in order to confer a sense of shadow or revealing light, Wildt thrusts the scalpel into hard marble, determined to prove that it cannot resist penetration. To worship mystery by means of respect or to confront mystery in order to uncover it: these are two styles, both intent on overcoming the inert heaviness of material, demanding of it some beautiful secret of life. The solitary memorial to our poor comrade that adorns the rooms of <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i>, exhibited in the show, is a beautiful example of Wildt's logical, incisive, and arduous art.<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Domenico Rambelli from Faenza represents yet another artistic temperament, simpler, purer, and closer to mainstream sculptural tradition.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  He tends toward grandiosity and monumentality as evidenced by the powerful lines found in the fragments of his colossal monument to Viareggio's fallen soldiers.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  His cheerful and exuberant temperament is perhaps more clearly on display in the playful cartoon-like portrait of honorable Ciarlantini.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The challenges of religious-monumental decoration are confronted in Antonio Maraini's <i>Stations of the Cross</i>, designed for the cathedral of Rodi.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  There is a tempting superficial seductiveness to this decorative trend to which Romolo Romanelli and Arturo Martini also succumb, and, to a lesser degree, the Tuscans Amerigo Focacci and Libero Andreotti.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
More profound are two heads, entitled <i>The Blind Woman </i>and <i>The Old Man</i> by Evaristo Boncinelli, a marvelous artisan and self-taught sculptor whose cruel illness has hindered his art.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
His compact modeling clings tightly to the reality of form, which is to say to the truth of spirit.
</p>

<p>
Painting hesitates at a crossroads between impressionism and renewed neoclassical certainty. One could say that the drama of modern painting consists in not renouncing the modern while attempting to infuse it with the eternal. To define the actual momentum of the human spirit and our modern vision through enduring things; to untangle the essential, which alone is simple and immutable, from the tangle of fleeting and complicated impressions.
</p>

<p>
Tosi, Carr&#x000E0;, Soffici, Sironi, and Funi confront this problem in various ways in both their landscapes and human res.<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  Among the landscape painters, Tosi gives the purest and most original solution by means of his plain and sober modesty. He departs from impressionism, and arrives at constructionism. By force of simplicity, by dint of proceeding from the momentary toward the essential, his spontaneous and limpid art finds forms and models itself on classical accents. Carr&#x000E0; is impeded by his excess refinement and archaism; but also in him such trends attain notable lyrical heights. His <i>Lecce,</i> acquired from the Gallery of Milan, is a work worthy of a museum.<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  The Tuscans, with Ardengo Soffici at the head of the pack, remain more closely tied to the reality of their land. Besides which Tuscany, with its dry limpidity and the elegant thinness of its lineaments, offers examples and warnings of inimitable style.
</p>

<p>
Regarding Sironi, I don't know why people continue to repeat the obligatory truisms about his seventeenth-century style and putative Caravaggioism.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  Certain patinas, certain softnesses of tone in the arrangement of tawny and gray shades do recall this or that form and color. But Sironi's paintings are glazed, compact, without flourishes of brushstrokes carelessly applied, and his spirit is austere and sad, entirely lacking in magniloquence, enclosed in a firmness that I would describe as taciturn.
</p>

<p>
There is a desire for grandeur and splendor in other works belonging to the Milanese group, the core nucleus of the Novecento, cases in point being two of the three canvases by Achille Funi. In the third, the <i>Venetian mask</i>, there is an airy lightness and spirited manner that display a perfectly palpable mastery acquired less by study than possessed by instinct.
</p>

<p>
Alberto Salietti has taken many forward steps.<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  Beside him are Pietro Marussig and Ubaldo Oppi with their female nudes of great carriage and of grand style; Casorati with certain new revelations of an art that, no longer chromatic and flat in its approach to form, now also investigates corporeal plasticity.<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  And Virgilio Guidi, Ren&#x000E9; Paresce, Monti, Piatti, Esodo Pratelli, Achille Lega, Tozzi, Trombadori, and Efisio Oppo with the 

<b></b>

<i>Carabinieri</i> and with the self-portrait done in a beautiful array of colors; Nino Bertoletti, Socrate, Sin&#x000F2;pico, Viani, De Grada, Dani, the most delicate Costetti, Montanari, Battaini; many names, many works, notable and praiseworthy.<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  The median level of the show is very high and this matters a great deal because geniuses are not created, but talents can be nurtured. And genius itself is thereby encouraged and elevated.
</p>

<p>
Leonetto Cappiello sent his posters to Italy from Paris as a greeting, bringing from the French metropolis the fervor of life and a smile of art and joy.<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>

While it is well known that anti-Semitism became a part of fascist doctrine after the Rome-Berlin Axis in 1938, well before that there were influential res in the fascist regime who worried about Judaism's threat. Sarfatti worked hard to distinguish the aims of Zionism from those of most Italian Jews, asking individual Italian Jews to pledge their allegiance to Italy and thereby attempt to thwart attempts to erode Jews' Italianness (Cannistraro and Sullivan, <i>Il Duce's Other Woman, </i>343&#x02013;47).

Sarfatti mentions four artists affiliated with the Ballets Russes, a project that brought together avant-garde artists, designers, dancers, and musicians to create a modern ballet derived from folklore, cubism, futurism and constructivism: L&#x000E9;on Bakst (1866&#x02013;1924), painter and stage designer; Sergei Diaghilev (1872&#x02013;1929), choroeographer; and Mikhail Fedorovich Larionov (1881&#x02013;1964), painter. In mentioning Adolphe Sturzwage, Sarfatti may be referring to L&#x000E9;opold Sturzwage (Survage) (1879&#x02013;1968), Russian painter, designer and illustrator, known for abstract compositions. Of the eighty-four works by Depero that appear in the catalogue, there were eight costumes for <i>The Song of the Nightingale</i>, a production by the Ballets Russes of the work by Igor Stravinsky.

Sarfatti's comparison here is based on Friedrich Nietzsche's distinction in <i>The Birth of Tragedy </i> between the Apollinian and Dionysian elements, whose duality, he argues, drives the development of art. The Dionysian, he associates with intoxication, ecstasy, and enchantment: it is the realm 

<b></b>

of music and dance (non-imagistic arts), and involves self-forgetfulness and revelry associated with the Greek Bacchic choruses or the dancing crowds of the Middle Ages. The Apollinian, on the other hand, is best represented by sculpture, and is connected to the world of dreams. Nietzsche emphasizes Apollo's association with sunlight, truth, and perfection, and Apollinian art exhibits restraint, a freedom from wilder emotions, a sense of calm repose, and even sublime expression.

Sironi founded <i>Il Montello, </i>a short-lived bi-monthly published from September to November 1918 for soldiers at the Piave front, with the futurist writer Massimo Bontempelli (1878&#x02013;1960). Emily Braun has noted that Sarfatti likely influenced Sironi to take up the task of beginning and illustrating <i>Il Montello </i>(<i>Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism</i> [Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000]<i>,</i> 38, 231).

Ettore Tito (1859&#x02013;1941) was one of many painters who gained new energy from the reunification of Venice to Italy in 1866. One of the regular Italian representatives at the Biennale, he worked in a conservative or salon style. Alessandro Pomi (1890&#x02013;1976) was his student at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice.

The artists Sarfatti lists represent an array of Italian avant-garde movements, including the Milanese futurists, the Roman <i>Valori Plastici </i>group, and the Florentine <i>vociani</i>: Carlo Carr&#x000E0; (1881&#x02013;1966), Mario Sironi (1885&#x02013;1961), Achille Funi (1890&#x02013;1972), Ardengo Soffici (1879&#x02013;1964), Leonardo Dudreville (1885&#x02013;1975), Fortunato Depero (1892&#x02013;1960), Luigi Russolo (1885&#x02013;1947, Gino Severini (1883&#x02013;1966), Giorgio de Chirico (1888&#x02013;1978), Giacomo Balla (1871&#x02013;1958).

Sarfatti's ironic reference to the innovations of the Neapolitan painter and illustrator Edoardo Dalbono (1841&#x02013;1915) plays on his achievement of commercial success by appealing to, rather than challenging, the tastes of the upper and upper middle classes.

Founded by Mario Broglio (1891&#x02013;1948), <i>Valori Plastici</i> was published in Rome from 1918&#x02013;1922. Its contributors included most of the artists identified in Sarfatti's next paragraph, among others. Although the group did not have a definite program, writings addressed matters of Italy's cultural heritage, the values of classicism, and the accomplishments of foreign artists and art movements. For a thorough discussion of this journal and its contributors, see Paolo Fossati, "<i>Valori Plastici", 1918&#x02013;22</i> (Torino: Giulio Einaudi, 1981).

In addition to artists discussed previously, Sarfatti mentions Riccardo Francalancia (1886&#x02013;1965), who attached himself to the Novecento group in the mid 1920s, and was a regular participant in the Rome Biennali and Quadriennali; probably Arturo Martini (1889&#x02013;1947), a sculptor who had been affiliated with Broglio's <i>Valori Plastici </i>group and who exhibited in Berlin. Although the text as printed in <i>Il Popolo d'Italia </i>gives the last name in this list as "Zur-Muelden," Sarfatti refers to the Lithuanian painter Edita Walterowna zur Muehlen (1886&#x02013;1977), a prominent member of the <i>Valori Plastici </i>group, and we have corrected the name.

Mussolini's meeting with the Direttorio Nazionale della Corporazione delle Arti Plastiche was one of many events marking the third anniversary of the March on Rome. On 28 October, <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i> published "A message from fascist artists to the President of the Council." The group, which included Carlo Carr&#x000E0;, Achille Funi, Mario Sironi, and Margherita Sarfatti, stressed the importance of art to the state, and that the state should support modern art ("Un messagio degli artisti fascisti al Presidente del Consiglio," <i>Il Popolo d'Italia,</i> 28 October 1925, p. 4).

As Ruth Ben-Ghiat has demonstrated, Italy's city planning in Addis Ababa in the late 1930s included a structural plan that "enforced racial segregation." She notes that because "the agenda of maintaining racial boundaries" was "at the heart of fascist colonial culture," "[a]rchitects and urban planners utilized race as the overriding criteria of spatial organization in Ethiopia, following mandates to keep Italian and African cultures separate and unequal" (Ben-Ghiat, <i>Fascist Modernities</i>, 128).

(Christian Matthias) Theodor Mommsen (1817&#x02013;1903) wrote numerous works of Roman history, including <i>R&#x000F6;mische Geschichte</i> (about Roman republic from its beginnings to the death of Julius Caesar), <i>R&#x000F6;misches Staatsrect</i> (a history of Roman constitutional law), <i>R&#x000F6;misches Strafrecht</i> (about Roman criminal law), as well as contributions to the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i> and the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Latinae.</i> Sarfatti uses three important ancient Roman historians&#x02014;Titus Livius (Livy, 59 BCE &#x02013; 17 CE), Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (c. 70 CE &#x02013; c. 135 CE), and Tacitus (c. 56 CE&#x02013; c. 125 CE)&#x02014;to represent the great historians of the Empire. Livy wrote during the Augustan era; his <i>Ab urbe condita</i> traces Rome's history from its mythical foundation to his present day. Suetonius' <i>De vita Caesarum</i> covers the lives of the Judio-Claudian emperors through the Flavian dynasty. In addition to his <i>Germania </i>(about the customs of the German tribes) and <i>Dialogus de oratoribus</i> (concerning the decline in Roman oratory), Tacitus' major historical works trace the history of the Flavian emperors (his <i>Histories</i>) and the period from the death of Augustus through the death of Nero (his <i>Annals</i>).

The <i>Acad&#x000E9;mie Fran&#x000E7;aise </i>was founded in 1634 by Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richilieu (1585&#x02013;1642) to maintain standards of literary taste and standardize the literary language. Richelieu's position as cardinal, first minister of France, and advisor to Louis XIII, and his activity during the Wars of Religion and Thirty Years' War, secured his influence on the French monarchy.

The <i>Institut national des Sciences et des Arts</i>&#x02014;later renamed the <i>Institut de France</i>&#x02014;in 1795 replaced five learned societies suppressed in 1793, including the <i>Acad&#x000E9;mie Francaise</i> (literary arts), <i>Acad&#x000E9;mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture</i> (painting and sculpture), <i>Acad&#x000E9;mie royale des Inscriptions et M&#x000E9;dailles </i>(inscriptions and medals), <i>Acad&#x000E9;mie royale des Sciences</i> (sciences), and <i>Acad&#x000E9;mie royale d'Architecture</i> (architecture). Jules Mazarin (1602&#x02013;1661) and Jean Baptiste Colbert (1619&#x02013;1683) were successors to Cardinal Richelieu, and influential in French political and economic matters.

Sarfatti interjects the Latin phrase "ex aequo," meaning "on even terms" or "equally," into her explanation of the make-up of the Academy.

Sarfatti refers here not only to the well-known rhetoric of futurist manifestos, but also to the violent confrontations between the futurists and other schools of the Italian avant-garde. On battles between the futurists and the Florentine <i>vociani</i>&#x02014;the group centered around the journal <i>La Voce</i> published by Giuseppe Prezzolini&#x02014;that began with an published critique, turned into a caf&#x000E9; brawl, and culminated in a train station ambush, see Walter L.

Sarfatti uses the standard Italian method of naming centuries: <i>quattrocento</i> refers to the "fourteen-hundreds," or fifteenth century. We retain it because it is popular in English-language writing about art, and because the name <i>Novecento italiano</i>, meaning roughly "Italian Twentieth Century," is meant to resonate with these designations. <i>Trecento</i> = fourteenth century, <i>quattrocento</i> = fifteenth century, <i>cinquecento</i> = sixteenth century, <i>seicento</i> = seventeenth century, <i>settecento</i> = eighteenth century, <i>ottocento</i> = nineteenth century, and <i>novecento</i> = twentieth century.
