With Johannes R. Becher the Germans have a gifted and spirited poet
whom they have not yet appreciated; neither the poems of his developing
period (1912-26) nor the documents of his extraordinary life (1891-1958)
have been read enough. Here and there (apart from a few praiseworthy
exceptions)
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 people are busy suppressing the memory of his early works as well as
 his real life story; and thirty years after his death there is still no
 biography that would show us how the wild young man transformed himself
 into the Comrade Minister of State who came to censure himself. European
 literary history has yet to admit that J. R. Becher, the first Communist
 Minister of Culture in the GDR, in his earlier and poetically most
 productive years was more thoroughly attracted to the Italian Futurists
 than any other German poet of the war generation, and enthusiastically
 seized on Futurist rhetoric, usually considered protofascist in its
 ideological implications, in the most effective Leninist poems ever
 written in the German tongue. Becher himself attempts to interpret and
 bend into shape the years of his youth and early manhood (at the end,
 he quotes Stalin's essay on language against the poems of his youth);
 and he is also a victim of the pedantry of a Germanist, which in its
 exclusive zeal of its interpretive and metatheoretical strivings, on
 the Left and the Right, has forgotten that poems, especially good ones,
 are sensual creatures that anarchically pierce the flatness and grayness
 of our everyday speech.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is difficult to describe how the idealistic Munich highschool student
revolted against his father, the highest judge in the kingdom of Bavaria,
and how at age seventeen, in a romantic suicide pact, killed a part-time
prostitute and attempted to

<B></B>

kill himself (his father rescued him, pleading insanity). He
never finished his studies and was repeatedly treated for morphine
addiction. Commuting between Munich and Berlin, a bohemian of the
gutters, he lived strangely unharmed through the years of the war and
his own confusions (he was not called up because his suicide attempt
that lacerated his lungs). He longed for salvation by soulful women and
beautiful young men, studied the writings of mystical nuns, Gorky, and
Lenin, and was readily welcomed in the best salons, or what was left of
them. After the war, he made his slow way to the all-forgiving Communist
party, the activism of the orthodox functionary (he had his part, together
with Georg Luk&aacute;cs, in undoing the Left avant-garde) and exile in
Moscow, where he never intervened for anyone accused of treason by the
Secret Police. He returned, by special plane of the Soviet Army, to his
devastated fatherland; and was later photographed at the massive desk
of his ministry, surrounded by joyous schoolgirls who presented bunches
of roses to the loyal poet of the new national anthem. It is a German
life: strange, unique, and beyond comparison.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's works resist clean divisions, and even Norbert Hopster, in his
praiseworthy dissertation, is not altogether happy with his chronicle of
its changes and motifs. The two merge, and the literary loyalties, from
Richard Dehmel to Walt Whitman and from Rimbaud to Futurism, blur together
and transcend the borders of ideological transformations; even in the
final Leninist <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I> (Machine rhythms; 1926) Becher
works, for the last time, with Futurist ideas and language patterns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The years 1912-13 and the beginning of the war pushed the schoolboyish
admirer of Richard Dehmel and Waldemar Bonsels into radical modernism. In
his collection of poems <I>Die Gnade eines Fr&uuml;hlings</I> (The grace
of a spring; 1912) he still published neoromantic songs in praise of Mary
("burningly my mouth arms itself / for you, Mary, sweet life"--this,
incidentally, also in protest against the Protestant father),
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 or pastoral lyricism ("so childyoung / the air makes me, so
 soulblossoming").
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Already one year later in <I>De Profundis Domine</I> 
 and <I>Verfall und Triumph</I> (Decay and triumph; 1914) the
 impressionistic and playful elements are gone; the influences of Georg
 Heym and Jakob van Hoddis, two young expressionists, draw Becher and
 his poems into urban Berlin, where everything happens in feverish
 simultaneity. Nightcaf&eacute;s, cinemas, and gigantic train stations
 are the new sites of experience: "Locomotives! / Steep-faced with the
 viaducts' momentum of the most rapid whores."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 He is fascinated by the war, and after paying tribute like so many of his
 writing contemporaries to the general patriotic enthusiasm with a cycle
 of sonnets, Becher, who was never a soldier and who later loved to be
 photographed in the uniform of the <I>Roter Frontk&auml;mpferbund</I>,
 creates his own myth of war; activated masses, brutality, steely,
 destructive technologies, and mutilated humans or, as he says,
 "<I>Menschenm&uuml;ll"</I> (human garbage).
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 War: at first as the possibility of destroying the bourgeois tradition
 and the tyranny of the fathers; then, a little later, war as the advance
 of a holy socialist army against the satanic enemies of humanity, and
 finally the Leninist war as bloody class struggle, in Germany and in
 the Soviet Union.

<B></B>

For a long time, this personal myth of war as "the only true hygiene of
the world"
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 is supported by Futurist motifs and rhetoric,
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 at first in the asyntactical <I>parole in libert&agrave;</I> and later
 mainly by Becher's Futuristic analogies, whose intensity and linguistic
 power far outreaches Marinetti's tests.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A 1915 text published in the <I>Wei&szlig;e Bl&auml;tter</I> signals
Becher's Futurist rhetoric, as well as the chronic attraction that the
technological brutality of modern warfare had for him. Historically, it is
not the first signal (that is to be found in the poetry and earlier), but,
by emulating the Italian model, has a particularly massive force. Becher
calls his text "Vorworte zum Tagebuch italienischen F&auml;hnrichs Georgio
Quadro" (Prologues to the diary of the Italian cadet sergeant Georgio
Quadro) and refers to the writings of a young Italian officer. The
diary was found after Quadro's death in the Austrian trenches at Krn
and published in the <I>Berliner Tageblatt</I> on 19 July 1915.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Becher sees the experiences of the patriotic officer, previously a
 civilian employee at a bank, as symbolic of all the young men of Europe
 who were pushed into the trenches with big words. In hymnic prose
 he continues the political education of the young Italian and leads
 him to the brink of political understanding, before the Austrian bomb
 tears him apart. Becher's realization of the moments in which Quadro
 takes sweet leave from the world of peach are written according to
 Futurist rules: "Sweat and tears. Gardens for you summer-shepherded,
 adria-blue and marble-wilderness, gardens: (most soft, most delicate,
 most flowery) for you creators in mourning rainbow-colored made up
 girls bend. Mother-of-pearl little faces long-oval."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The syntax is all but destroyed, with Futurist analogies instead of
 traditional comparisons. Indeed, Becher uses, or rather invents for
 himself (the only German example that I know of) the "semaphoric"
 function of adjectives, as Marinetti had demanded in his manifesto of
 11 May 1913.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Adjectives follow nouns and refer parenthetically to earlier nouns,
 bypassing the immediate antecedent. The <I>parole in libert&agrave;</I> 
 and their distaste for the verbum finitum (which here sometimes ossifies
 into a participle) dominate the many passages of the "Prologues" in
 which Becher confronts the reader with the fragmentation of humans and
 landscapes: "Exploding Colonel Lazzoni of the Fifth Carabinieri; with
 turned-out face; on it intestines, teeth, a throat all intertwining." Or:
 "Fever. Thick air. Lungs tear. Dripping horse-corpse. Arms farmerboys
 hacked to pieces. Hair, intestines, flesh--: one pulp.... Bloodily
 backed knife whipped. Ditches chlorinechalkpale filled."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Such images return in Becher's poetry almost monotonously for years,
 but not in the spirit of pacificism; rather, they appear with a zealous
 conviction that the old war would have to change itself into the new,
 no less aggressive war against everything old before the total dawn
 of paradise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If there were a reliable biography, we would have an answer to the
questions of when and how Becher first became acquainted with Futurist
texts. After the literary projects of his publisher-friend Heinrich
Bachmair had failed (including the journal <I>Die Revolution</I>, where
Hugo Ball had published his early hymn on Futurist painting), Becher moved
on, like Ball, to the circle of writers around the journal <I>Aktion</I>,

<B></B>

and it was the translator Else Hadwiger who inspired him, like Ball,
to read the Futurists. A letter dated 18 March 1916 from Becher to the
publisher Ernst Sulzbach of Berlin confirms, at any rate, that he has
read the Futurists Marinetti and Paolo Buzzi--that is, just those authors
whom Hadwiger translated for <I>Sturm</I> and <I>Aktion</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Personal issues are of some significance here: after the death of her
 husband, the Prague symbolist poet Victor Hadwiger who had published
 a great deal in <I>Aktion</I>, Else Hadwiger did not withdraw from
 social life. She became sympathetic to increasingly radical ideas, and
 was also often to be seen in the company of the translator Fritz Max
 Cah&eacute;n in caf&eacute;s and literary assemblies,
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 as well as with the Wilmersdorf publisher R. A. Meyer, who had published
 her translation of Marinetti in a limited edition. They met in Meyer's
 apartment at the Bayrischer Platz or in her own spacious flat, at that
 time not far from the S&uuml;dwestkorso and Ludwig Meidner's studios
 (Meidner often stayed with her). Becher, I have no doubt, was closely
 connected to Hadwiger, regardless of his other liaisons. He sought
 refuge with her, both literally and spiritually, whenever his Munich
 exhaustions led him to Berlin. Even later, when the hectic affair of
 1914-15 was over, Hadwiger, who had already sacrificed part of her
 fortune for her husband, went on, together with the Princess Mechthilde
 Lichnowsky and Katharina Kippenberg, the wife of the Leipzig publisher,
 to support the morphine-dependent poet-vagabond (Harry Graf Ke&szlig;ler
 did his share too).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Love poems are not reliable biographical documents, but at least they
testify to how certain processes, internal and external, articulate the
writer's ability to experience; and in this respect Becher's Berlin poems
"Ekstasen der Z&auml;rtlichkeit" (Ecstacy of tenderness) and "Ein Ende"
(An end), both of them explicitly "dedicated to Frau Else Hadwiger," are
revealing. The one can be found in the collection <I>Verbr&uuml;derung</I>
(Fraternization; 1916) and the other, originally dated 1915, in the
collection <I>P&auml;an gegen die Zeit</I> (Paean against the time;
1918). The cycle "Ekstasen der Z&auml;rtlichkeit" consists of four pieces
introduced by the highly suggestive verses by Alfred Mombert: "You are the
one who understands me / and who is reconciled / to my burning crimes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The poet professes an absolute feeling of love; Else is mother, Holy
 Virgin, lover, "unfolded like a flower" and "protectress"; a world lives
 in the "mirror" of her "oval nails"; "young men boiling / poured dying
 themselves over the planks of [her] hips"; and the world speaks only
 of her: "you are meant by the homecoming of noisy soldiers... / the
 banners shine your name / you, every cinema's loud poster."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In the other poem, "Ein Abschied" (A farewell)
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 is constituted of two pieces: the first is agitated and, in spite
 of all the Futurist analogies ("<I>Nacht-Ozean</I>" [night-ocean]),
 an unsettled mixture of realism and confessional hymn; the second is
 more relaxed, simultaneously classical and lyrical, the stanzaic sound
 reminiscent of the old Goethe. The first part depicts the scandal of
 a violent farewell: someone else has gained the favor of the woman
 ("O woman! Chestnutbrown"), and the writer feels abandoned amid
 alienation and threats: "blessed was he. Sweet. At home. / Now fly
 bridges...knives...bombs...!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 While lost in the streets, he finds only bragging, naive, and evil
 words for the past: "the other may seize you--... / powerful

<B></B>

marches explode like a gun / Bursting apart your bed's mudlake."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The second part is cooler and more collected; the writer has found
 himself again, speaks words of comfort to himself: "Yes --, now he is
 drifting again, / only for a short while bound to her."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 This lover was home to him, but the moment of leavetaking is a new
 beginning:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's acquaintance with the work of the Futurist Paolo Buzzi is,
however, of little significance for the development of his own Futurist
leanings. Becher refers to Buzzi's "I reclusi," a little imprecisely, as
"Gedichte aus den St&auml;dten" (Poems from the cities) in a letter to
the publisher Ernst Sulzbach. That choice of wording reveals that this
cycle of six poems, whose original title Else Hadwiger had translated in
the 7 November 1914 edition of <I>Aktion</I> more precisely as "Das Lied
der Eingeschlossenen" (The song of those confined) had impressed upon
him--contemporaneously with Heym and Hoddis--the dangerous and demonic
nature of the metropolis instead of the aspect he chose to emphasize, at
least in his Buzzi imitations: the accentuation of new technology. In
his "Reclusi" cycle Buzzi himself, in spite of his personal loyalty to
Marinetti, was not so much a Futurist in the sense of the early manifesto
as a late or ironic romantic or symbolist; the Futurist element lies
exclusively, or almost exclusively (as with the early Marinetti) in
the free verse, as it was programmatically cultivated in the journal
<I>Poesia</I>, which Buzzi helped found. "Das Lied der Eingeschlossenen"
consists of elegiac role poems, in which the victims--the forgotten,
those who had been forced from their cities into secrecy--speak in
chorus of their sufferings, longings, and hopes "Aus den Kl&ouml;stern"
(From the monasteries), "Aus den Bordellen" (From the brothels), "Aus den
Hospit&auml;lern" (From the hospitals), "Aus den Gef&auml;ngnissen" (From
the jails), "Aus den Irrenh&auml;usern"  (From the mental hospitals), and
"Von den Friedh&ouml;fen" (From the graveyards). (In Else Hadwiger's
translation, part 3 of the Italian cycle, the chorus of the soldiers
from the barracks, "Dalle Caserne," is missing.) The forgotten speak
calmly, movingly, and simply like the monks: "clean the little cell,
full of roses the small garden,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 or the whores: "we write home and stitch fine linen lace / ...don't
 know why they despise us outside,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 and only rarely in helpless irony like the sick in the hospitals, who
 complain about the tedious holiday visitors: "On Sundays the masses
 stream here like to the graveyard, / knock at the beds and dirty the
 carpets in the hallway / and bring us unhealthy sweets."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Futurist elements, in the sense of the ideological and rhetorical
 demands of the manifestos, are present only at a distance, for example
 in the anger of the mad: "we have been procreated by the green anger
 of the innermost organs" (reminiscent of Marinetti's romantic cult of
 the creative insane in the second manifesto), or the bizarre images in
 the litany of the dead, who

<B></B>

complain about what the living could have done to them: "head over
heals they could have thrown us into the sea, / hung on a balloon, let
us drift into the blue!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher replies with his own poems to Buzzi's "Das Lied der
Eingeschlossenen (I reclusi)," but the noteworthy element of his
reply is the fact that he contradicts the Futurist poet by being more
Futurist. The later poems of the German poet are well ahead of Buzzi's
early poetry in their radical quality. Buzzi's thematic accusations are
taken up and reshaped by Becher in his poetry collections <I>Verfall und
Triumph</I> and <I>P&auml;an gegen die Zeit</I> (for example in the poems
"Krankenhaus" [Hospital] and "Bordell" [Bordello]); and I suspect that
even poems like "Die Armen" (The poor), "Die Huren" (The whores), and
"Aus den H&ouml;fen" (From the courtyards) are in accordance with the
suggestions by Buzzi.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Becher had been acquainted with Hadwiger's Buzzi translation from
 the beginning, and his own hospital poems (Becher had had his own
 experiences, in the Landesanstalt Haar, a psychiatric hospital near
 Munich) demonstrate how he takes up Buzzi's perspective and tone and
 then emancipates himself from them only a little later. In "Krankenhaus"
 , especially in the second of the four pieces, he, like Buzzi,
 lets the sick speak in chorus; Buzzi's soft and melancholy elements
 are not wholly absent:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
We cry ourselves through prison and ether-hall
<BR>
Towards each other, experiencing sweet closeness,
<BR>
When we are given the last supper,
<BR>
we are anointed with oil's soft snow.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the later version of "Krankenhaus" , to which Becher himself
applies the term "variation," Buzzi's melancholy and soft irony are
destroyed by the dithyramb; the poem no longer speaks for and with the
sick, but instead presumes to change their world through the released
word: "I enforce their dissolution into wonderful May creatures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The opening of the poem, line one, partly alludes to Buzzi/ Hadwinger's
 "qui si muore in fila"/"hier stirbt man reihenweise" (here one dies in
 rows [<I>WIF</I>, 256]) and turns into "hier w&auml;lzt sich's frei"
 (here it wallows itself free [<I>WIF</I>, 329]) in Becher's text,
 which then goes on to revel in its usual way in horrifying images of
 pus and blood. The syntax is cryptically reduced: "pointy steel from
 temples shrinking thunderstorms"; metaphor takes the form of Futuristic
 analogies: "slime-seaweed," "clip-skeletons," "shepherd-doctors"; and
 just as the Futurist manifestos demanded, the cities are "overgrown
 with electric streams."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Here Becher is the real Futurist, not Buzzi.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his later writings, which contain more than one confession about
the creative experiments of his youth or, as he puts it, "special Don
Quichotteries,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Becher the state minister thinks back nostalgically to the readings and
 contemporaries of his youth and touches on a basic idea of Futurism,
 which he ascribes to a friend from that period. In his reminiscences of
 what he calls expressionism (the minister now shies away from the word
 "Futurism," part of his vocabulary in 1914) and of his early poems,
 the poetic, if not even ontological, principle of simultaneity plays
 an important

<B></B>

part. Simultaneity and a modern "<I>Weltgef&uuml;hl</I>" (world sentiment)
were the same for him (and for the Futurists), and when he speaks of
"<I>Simultanismus</I>" (simultanism) he quotes a term that did not fail
to make its impression, even on him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In <I>Sturm</I>  Herwarth Walden had published Umberto Boccioni's
 essay on the "Simultan&eacute;it&eacute; Futuriste" (Futurist
 simultaneity) (in which the painter claimed the term for the Futurists
 and against the Frenchman Robert Delaunay), but the later Becher
 ascribes the demand for simultaneity to his unhappy friend Jakob van
 Hoddis, who was in the habit of publishing his poems in <I>Sturm</I>
 in the years 1911-13. Hoddis claimed, the later Becher writes, that
 "the sense of simultaneity"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 is already intact in Homer (and therefore not only with
 the Futurists or their French colleagues, who articulated
 simultaneit&agrave;/simultan&eacute;it&eacute; as a modern
 program?). Becher adds that he and his friends were willing to realize
 this sense of simultaneity as an "immeasurable world-wideness,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 as Hoddis had done in his famous two verses of "Weltende" (End of
 the world)
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
--"the great is mixed in with the small and vice versa, nothing is able
to last separately by itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The call for simultaneity (which also appears in the diary of Georg Heym)
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 withered soon, according to Becher, to a "stencil," and "bureaucratic
 verse-products were generated, which were mathematically calculated,
 so that each sentence had to be followed by an antithesis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Whether entirely calculated or not, in Becher's early praxis this
 simultaneity is often signalled by a strong Bavarian "<I>Derweil</I>"
 (meanwhile), which connects even the most contradictory events and
 experiences "in the spirit of an expressionist pantheism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The minister of state does not, however, remember that in a 1923
 letter to the editors of the cultural section of the <I>Frankfurter
 Zeitung</I> in which he attempted to explain his prosody, as a
 Marxist he connected even the unusual typography of his verses
 and his idiosyncratic punctuation (as stopsigns against the flow of
 syntax) with <I>simultaneit&agrave;</I>. He wrote at that time to the
 <I>Frankfurter Zeitung</I> that the antisyntactical precautions transform
 "the consecutive" "with a dialectical manoeuvre into a parallel" and
 added that the poem thus is put into "the sphere of simultaneity" and
 indicates "also externally the rapid speed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 It is of less significance whether Becher owed this connection
 of simultaneity and speed, <I>simultaneit&agrave;</I> and
 <I>velocit&agrave;</I>, to Hadwiger or Boccioni, than the fact that,
 whether he wanted to or not, as a recently converted Leninist and
 enthusiastic partisan of communism, Becher was a poetic ally of the
 Futurists.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All arguments for or against Becher's entanglement in Futurism would
be farfetched if they could not be supported, as has been demonstrated
in detail by Hopster and also partly by Carmine Chiellino, by shared
features of thematics and rhetoric and indeed by their integration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Among the expressionists there were many city and war poets, but only
 a few who were as attracted by modern technology and its destructive,
 purifying effects as Becher was. With its reduced syntax in which
 the noun and simultaneity reign, the way in which he describes the
 metropolis, as simultaneously horrendous and the paradisiacal site
 of utopian beginnings, and the ideal war, as an at once violent and
 hopeful destruction of old worlds, is closer to

<B></B>

Italian Futurism than any other German poems of the era. No other German
poet wrote poems like "Auf ein Maschinengewehr" (To a machine gun) or
"Lokomotiven" (The locomotives) simultaneously with "Die neue Syntax"
(The new syntax).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Had he written in Italian, Becher would have become a towering poet
 of European Futurism in the years 1913-19 and even later, with his
 Leninist <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I> . The decisive elements are not
 so much the movable parts of the Futuristic technology--the racing cars,
 airplanes, trains, and the complete war arsenals: battleships, torpedoes,
 shrapnel, the phallic cannons (as in Marinetti's "Schlacht" [Battle]
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
) and the spewing bayonets--but rather their linguistic presence in
a reduced syntax, in "<I>befreiten Worten</I>" (liberated words), in
simultanism and in the analogies and analogy chains, which correspond to
Marinetti's programmatic demands. Even if Hadwiger and van Hoddis had
not related things Futurist to him, Becher would have invented his own
Futurism under the irrepressible compulsion of his explosive imagination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Each of the German authors who grappled with Futurism accentuated in his
own texts a different element of the Futurist rhetoric; and while Alfred
D&ouml;blin dealt mainly with the <I>parole in libert&agrave;</I>,
and August Stramm and Ball (to simplify things here) dealt with
the structure of the syntax, Becher, unlike anyone else, worked with
analogies and chains of analogies. In Marinetti's poetic program, which
gives precedence to the image over the sentence, the "analogies," a word
he derives from Edgar Allan Poe, number among the significant features
of the new rhetoric. He explains in the "Technical Manifesto" and in its
"Supplement," as they could be read in <I>Sturm</I> in 1912 and 1913,
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 that the modern "<I>aviatische Schnelligkeit</I>" (aviatic speed) of
 our "<I>Weltkenntnis</I>" (<I>la conoscenza del mondo</I> [knowledge
 of the world]) demands its correspondence in a speedy metaphoric;
 no more leisurely comparisons using "as" or "just as," but instead,
 lightning-like "doublings" that "pull the object into one characteristic
 word with the image evoked by it,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 i.e. man-torpedo-boat (<I>uomotorpediniera</I>), woman-gulf
 (<I>donna-golfo</I>), crowd-surf (<I>folla-risacca</I>), and so on.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Marinetti does not hesitate to distinguish between bad, good, and
 still better analogies; basically an anticlassical <I>concetto</I>
 (conceit) is hidden in each analogy, and therefore Marinetti
 demands "<I>Steigerungen</I>" (increases) of the analogies, which
 for their highest effect bind together "<I>fernstehende</I>"
 (distant), "<I>verschiedene</I>" (different), and "<I>Feindliche
 Dinge</I>" (antagonistic things) in such a way that they replace the
 merely mechanical and threadbare elements of the language with the
 unexpected, the surprising, and the effective. When a writer compares
 a fox terrier with a small thoroughbred (Marinetti's example), he has
 not yet done much to break through the expected; that only happens
 when he connects the image of the terrier with the agitated bubble
 of boiling water. Marinetti's sketch is not content with the single
 analogy (his text "Schlacht" is the first to show that); the whole
 world is in rapid motion, and therefore the "<I>aufeinanderfolgenden
 Bewegungen</I>" (successive movements) require a "<I>Kette</I>" (chain)
 or a "<I>Netz</I>" (net) of analogies, "which one sinks into the sea
 of the appearances."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Nothing would be more desirable, Marinetti says, at least theoretically
 and without any concern for the reader, than to leave the first
 members of

<B></B>

these chains of the analogy out and to bind together only the second
ones in a mysterious poetic text, in pure images.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's endeavor to create word combinations, which were supposed to
enable him to intensify the expression and to lessen the necessities
of typical syntactical construction, has a long history that begins
with his earliest poems, is in danger of solidifying into a rhetorical
mannerism in the last years of World War I, and finds its end in the
1926 <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I>. Those special noun constructions using
hyphens, which one may call Futuristic analogies, cannot be found
before the end of 1912 / the beginning of 1913, that is, before the
publication of Marinetti's "Technical Manifesto" and "Supplement" in
<I>Sturm</I>. In <I>Die Gnade eines Fr&uuml;hlings</I>, Becher still
writes in the neoromantic mode: "the glow of the evening rose" pushes in,
"the evening sky plays completely blue, shinysunkenblue," and when he
is really adventurous, Becher also imitates Arno Holz's morphological
monsters, and the sunbeams sit on the "skyandcloudglowingdowndrinking"
backs of the roofs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 In <I>Verfall und Triumph</I>, which contains the poems written between
 December 1912 and November 1913, the sentiment is expunged once and
 for all; Becher works with frequent noun combinations, which the German
 language easily tolerates as neologisms, for example "gold-trombones"
 and "mould-moon," or he connects adverbial and adjectival notions with
 hyphens: "reeling-crazy," "deathly-shrill," "drunkenclose," in a pattern
 he will rely on for a long time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 The poem "Die Armen" (The poor) constitutes the obvious exception to
 this pattern, in which we see signs of Becher's future development;
 we find the first, awkward attempts to form analogies like "civil
 servant-snout," more effective examples in the call to Christ as
 "diseasehoard," and anticipations of the future with "brain-beams."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Even the first attempt to unite two analogies in a single verse is here:
 "when smell-seas softly caress our endurer-bodies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's poems written during World War I (published in various volumes
and often suppressed) are characterized by the frequent repetition
and boldness of the analogies; some are closely related to Marinetti's
standard (for example, "shrapnel thicket,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 "woman-slough,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 and "human-ant"
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
), but in Becher's livelier moments and before the process ossifies
into a mannerism, they show an unforgettable poetic spontaneity and
mysteriousness, as in "nonsense-litany," "tarantula-Christ," and
"places-pimples."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Sometimes they lock into incredible chains of analogy that are
 unparalleled in even the most adventurous expressionist poetry of the
 era: for example, the snow in its "nail-whip-flight," "O forehead-rabble
 slipping: snow-accord," or the line "trombone-taiphoo-thunderstorm from
 lip-coasts rage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 This all goes far beyond the poems of Marinetti and his friends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's analogies might be more closely defined by a process that not
only observes the basic patterns of his combinations but also helps to
separate spontaneity from mannerism. Most noticeable are those forms
of the analogies in which the human body or one of its parts forms a
semantic element. Statistically, those forms in which the corporeal
functions as a basic term predominate, which suggests that Becher very
often only feigns analogies by forming composites according to the

<B></B>

grammatical rules of the German language (Marinetti does not have this
possibility in his languages) and separating them again with a hyphen,
as in "torpedo-bodies," "flag-arms" (or "lasso-arms"), "flag-hairs,"
"hill-hip," "rock-knee," "moss-lips," "forehead-dam," "pulp-head,"
"drum-belly," or "bayonet-arm."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Statistically more frequent than these pseudo-analogies (which twist
 the possibilities of German morphologies apart and are reminiscent of
 baroque composites) are those in which the bodily element appears first
 and massively increases the imagistic power of the analogy through the
 inversion, for example in "finger-rake," "neck-towers," "lip-ruin,"
 "eyelash-moon," or "muscle-viaducts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 A third pattern, one which tends to degenerate into mannerism, can
 be found when a physiological aspect, such as blood or a secretion,
 functions semantically as a basic word, for example "pus-moon" (Becher
 shares Marinetti's dislike of <I>la luna</I>), "excrement-cloud,"
 "blood-night," "pus-fog," and "excrement-cities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 My observations are unfair insofar as they tend to focus on repetition
 rather than the singular, the mannerism rather than the uniqueness;
 but in the work of a poet, one cannot be defined without the other,
 and without being aware of what mannerism Becher develops, I cannot be
 completely clear as to his originality. An analogy like "craziness-salt,"
 found in <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I>, exceeds all statistical analyses,
 which inevitably find repeated patterns because they are meant to find
 them; an interpretation of the unrepeated, the unrepeatable, has the
 larger claim.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>

I intentionally have not quoted from Becher's <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I>
, because I think that it belongs to the key texts of the
radical Left German literary avantgarde, just as a little later Brecht's
<I>Heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe</I> (St. Joan of the stockyards;
1929-30) does. Becher's collection of poetry was forgotten because
it positions itself against traditional ideological prejudices. One
knows only too clearly what is Left and what is Right, rhetorically and
politically, and one finds oneself disturbed by poems in which a visionary
Leninism articulates itself in a poetic idiom in which a tendency toward
Futurist themes and rhetoric once more, and for the last time, goes
to the extreme of linguistic self-destruction, stammering, feverish,
fragmented. These poems, including the violent "Hymne an Lenin" (Hymn
to Lenin), read as if possessed, with the class war as the only power
of salvation in the world:

 The only commentary that does justice to this kind of poetry can be found
 in Antonio Gramsci's remarks on Anatoli Lunatscharsky's speech to the
 Italian delegates at the Second Communist International (Lunatscharsky

Gramsci will later judge Futurism differently, but his Lunatscharsky
commentary explains and positions Becher's remarkable mixture of Leninist
dogma and Futurist rhetoric in their own historical moment. In their
respective beginnings, Futurism and fascism were not as inseparably linked
as the impatient generalizations of later ideological criticism makes out,
and it would be productive to ask the question of whether the national
anarchism of the early Futurists does not in fact clearly anticipate
elementary features of the German national Bolshevism of the Weimar era.
