In need of money, the 23-year old Jean Rhys posed nude for a British artist, probably William Orpen, in 1913.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Similarly strapped for cash in 1923, Claude McKay, then in his early thirties and living in Paris, posed nude in the art school of the Cubist painter Andre Lhote.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  A white woman from an elite Dominican family and future European modernist, Rhys occupied a very different colonial subjectivity to Claude McKay, who was the son of a successful black peasant proprietor in Jamaica and in 1923 already a prominent poet. Yet both Caribbean writers responded to the experience of posing nude by writing and rewriting the experience in a way that challenged modernist aesthetics, exposing the ostensibly radical modernist primitivism which was deeply implicated in Europe's colonial and national projects. Further, both Rhys and McKay expressed their critique of modernism and nationalism by exposing the racialized sexual politics of modernist aesthetics. I take advantage of this apparent coincidence in the biography and work of Rhys and McKay to illustrate that their similarly transgressive representation of sexuality challenged the modernist movements in which they participated as well as the then emerging national literatures in the anglophone Caribbean. 

<p>
In the first three decades of the twentieth century, anglophone Caribbean writers established national literatures as part of the development of cultural and political nationalism in the region. As the work of Rhys and McKay illustrates, during the same period, Caribbean writers made significant contributions to European modernism and to the Harlem Renaissance. Because most writers had extensive experience abroad and engaged with 


<b></b>


Caribbean, European, and U.S. culture in their work, anglophone Caribbean literature of this period was international. It provides a window into the process by which Caribbeans integrated Western modernism and modernity into the Caribbean and the Caribbean into European and U.S. literary movements. Not all writers, however, were equally nationalist. Some, like the Jamaican poet and playwright Una Marson, sought to establish national literatures in the Caribbean and, at the same time, saw their work as contributing to the emerging political nationalism in the region. In contrast, McKay (as an ambivalent participant in the Harlem Renaissance and strong proponent of international black aesthetics) took a critical stance towards European and African American nationalisms. Similarly Rhys rejected European nationalism and had little or no contact with national literary or political movements in the Caribbean.

<p>
All writers of this period, however, privileged Caribbean folk culture and sexuality, and thus, made the daily lives and cultural practices of colonized Afro-Caribbean working class people the subject of bourgeois literary and national culture. In establishing black folk culture and sexuality as the center of Caribbean literature, Caribbean artists confronted the phenomenon that modern European aesthetics oddly mirrored their literary projects. Sexuality and black culture held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein. Yet, as Simon Gikandi persuasively argues, Picasso (and presumably many of his colleagues) incorporated elements of African cultures into modernism by divorcing African bodies and culture from individuality, modernity, and the "brutality of late colonialism."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  While Caribbean writers saw black folk culture as the basis of a modern national culture and identity, the linked European projects of modernism and imperialism construed black folk culture and sexuality as evidence of colonized people's uncontrolled sexuality and incapacity to rule themselves. 

<p>
As has been noted by many critics, the fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism. Rhys and McKay worked with Orpen and Lhote respectively; they refer to Amedeo Modigliani, Ludwig Kirchner, and Jules Pascin explicitly in their work.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  With the exception of Orpen, these writers had adeep interest in African and other "primitive" cultures and are representative of the larger movement of European modernist and avant-garde aesthetics in their extensive deployment of African and other "non-western" art.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  As Sieglinde Lemke asserts, Picasso (and his peers) built modernist aesthetics by "mocking philistine notions of decency <b> . . . </b> allying himself with what the bourgeois ethos considered taboo&#x02014;prostitutes and African masks."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In "Les Desmoiselles D'Avignon," Picasso famously transformed a painting of prostitutes in Avignon by fashioning their faces and bodies in shapes and angles inspired by African art. He thus merged French prostitutes with his conception of primitive African art.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Pascin's 1924 "Temple of Beauty" similarly and explicitly illustrates how colonial constructions of gender, sexuality, and race were reiterated in modernist art (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). At the center of a chaotic canvas of naked women, a large and nearly nude black woman directs her enormous buttocks at the spectator. This pose in particular replicated and perhaps parodied nineteenth-century portrayals of the "Hottentot Venus" which emphasized


<b></b>


the enormity of the Venus's buttocks and typically directed them at the observer. Sander Gilman has argued that these representations articulated the European fantasy that black women's buttocksliterally embodied their racial licentiousness and difference.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  "The Temple of Beauty" similarly illustrates the convergence of representations of the prostitute and the primitive, of black and female sexuality in early twentieth century art. Sander Gilman associates these artistic representations of black women's sexuality with Freudian and other scientific discourses, which defined female genitalia as more primitive than male genitalia or saw African sexual practices as a form of prostitution ("HP," 91, 99). As models, white women, people of color, and non-western artefactsthus inhabited the same or similar imaginative and physical spaces.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

Growing up in Caribbean colonies McKay and Rhys both experienced the extreme distance colonial society placed between the white planter's daughter and the black peasant&#x02014;a distance of class clothed in terms of a discourse of respectability&#x02014;marriage, gender roles, etiquette, and education. While in Europe, however, Rhys and McKay were confronted with the merging of black male and white female identities. As models, McKay became metaphorically sexualized and female, while Rhys became sexualized and black. As models they lost their particular identities and modernity and became complicit in modernist projects that expressed the colonial ideology they sought 


<b></b>


to challenge. The association of the nude model with prostitution and female sexuality contradicted McKay's goal of creating a strong, masculine black and modernist aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Similarly, European modernists' merger of blackness, sexuality, and white femininity stood in opposition to Rhys's aesthetic project of delineating the similarities and differences between categories of race, sexuality, class, and gender.

<p>
Gikandi begins a recent essay with an anecdote that suggests that European modernism subsumed the Caribbean into its conception of Africa. When the Guyanese artist, Aubrey Williams, met Picasso, Picasso expressed his desire to paint Williams's "very fine African head."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This desire at once denied Williams the identity of modern artist and subsumed him into the category of things African and therefore primitive. Rhys indicates that English discourse generally elided differences between the Caribbean and Africa. In <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, English chorus girls call Rhys's white creole heroine a "hottentot" because she "was born in a hot place . . . in the West Indies or somewhere . . . "<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  When they posed nude, Rhys and McKay found themselves in positions parallel to Williams's. They had stepped into the shoes of Picasso's prostitutes and primitives and become both sexualized and Africanized. 

<p>
Rhys and McKay transformed these alienating elements of modernist aesthetics by writing and rewriting the scene of posing nude. McKay includes his experience of posing in his memoir <i>A Long Way from Home</i>  and his novel <i>Banjo</i> ; Rhys makes posing and modern art critical to her heroine's identity in "Triple Sec" (1924?), <i>Quartet</i> , <i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i> , and <i>Good Morning Midnight</i> . In the course of representing this scene, they asserted the modernity and humanity of models and colonized people and the artifice of Europe's conception of the primitive. To create Caribbean modernism, their work thus redefined the central res and dynamics of European modernist aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In rewriting the scene of posing, Rhys and McKay represent a conventional tableau in early twentieth century European painting, the self portrait with model&#x02014;examples include Orpen's 1911 "The Model" and Leo Kirchner's "Artist with Model." They thus confronted the terms and power dynamics of modernist representation through their redefinition of a genre of painting that self-consciously represented the power dynamics of representation itself.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Although McKay only briefly mentions posing in his autobiography <i>A Long Way from Home</i> , the text critiques European avant-garde andmodernist artists by illustrating that they participated in the European colonialism and bourgeois respectability many of them sought to critique.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Pascin serves as McKay's introduction to the modernists' world of brothels. McKay describes meeting Pascin in Paris and receiving a letter of introduction to a man McKay tellingly names "Le Corse," a brothel owner in Marseilles who shows artists around the red light district and provides them protection. Artists paid tribute to Le Corse by painting his portrait, and Pascin gave him sketches and paintings.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  From the profits of prostitution, Le Corse raised his family in respectability. He proudly told McKay that he didn't "allow [his] daughters to powder 


<b></b>


and smoke. I am bringing them up in the right way. They go to a convent school. My son goes to a commercial college. We keep our family clear and clean of our business." (<i>LWH</i>, 285) Prostitution provided the capital for respectable women to attend convent school and make respectable marriages while modernist artists depended on this hypocritical and age-old system, in order to produce modernist art that claimed to radically challenge European conceptions of respectability and to constitute a modern aesthetic. McKay expresses the significance of this encounter with Le Corse by suggesting that it inspired him to write <i>Banjo</i>.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 

<p>
<i>Banjo</i> embodied and theorized McKay's new black and masculine modern primitivism. A history of modernity from the perspective of the international black (male) proletariat, <i>Banjo</i> links an explicit critique of European modernist aesthetics with a critique of European and U.S. modernity. Through the experiences of black working men in Marseilles, the novel records the consolidation of European capitalism and nationalism and the rise of U.S. imperialism in the aftermath of World War I. Nearly all the women are prostitutes, most of them French but many from the empire. This is a "romance of the race"&#x02014;a genre McKay constructs in opposition to a national romance in which a heterosexual union would serve as allegory for national unity. <i>Banjo</i>'s protagonists are not a heterosexual couple, but Ray, the Haitian intellectual of <i>Home to Harlem</i> and Banjo, an African American working class musician. They are the leaders of a community of black men from Africa, the U.S., and the Caribbean, sailors who have jumped ship just after WWI and resist the capitalist system by rejecting work and sharing their income from panhandling, music, and women. The internationalism of the group is an explicit rejection of nationhood&#x02014;Banjo, for instance, arrives in Marseilles by renouncing his U.S. passport and asking to be deported. The romance ends not in a marriage symbolic of national unity but with the pairing of two strong men, Ray and Banjo, setting off together to vagabond through Europe. Their homosocial and homoerotic partnership symbolizes the need for a black international solidarity.

<p>
The scene of his hero, Ray, posing nude, plays a central part in establishing the diasporic cultural and social unity at the heart of McKay's project. Ray orchestrates a night of storytelling surrounded by black men from Africa, the Caribbean, and the U.S. at the Caf&#x000E9; African, "a big caf&#x000E9;, the first that any Negro in the town ever owned." At first the Senegalese fear that Ray will represent them as primitive and inferior to African Americans, but once Ray tells an "African folk tale" from Haiti, "nearly all the Senegalese wanted to tell a native story" and the national divisions between the men diffuse.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Ray is the only one to tell two stories&#x02014;the second of his stories is the tale of posing nude in a Paris art school. 

<p>
In telling his story of posing nude, Ray radically redefines the European conception of the primitive as a feminine, uncontrolled child in need of European domination. When the art students, who are white U.S. women, ask Ray his opinion of African art, he responds that African sculpture is defined by "the feeling of perfect self-mastery and quiet self-assurance."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The students, however, act out the colonial desire to dominate the primitive by measuring Ray's body while the teacher, also a white woman, has Ray perform a Western fantasy of black male hypersexuality. He "pose[d] in a very 


<b></b>


interesting tableau&#x02014;standing naked on a little platform with a stout long staff in my hand and a pretty Parisienne in the nude crouched at the base" (<i>B</i>, 129). The "stout long staff," an external prop, magnifies the sexual significance his black body already signals. The naked white woman at its base mocks the myth that black men rape white women, by suggesting that white women worship black male sexuality. In making a "nordic" woman invent this pose for Ray, McKay reveals that these primitivist ideas of black male sexuality are the invention of white and European culture.

<p>
Ray disrupts this modernist project and rescues black masculinity from its feminization by asserting his sexual power. At one modeling session, Ray muses on the sensuality of the Harlem cabaret, "Sheba Palace," and becomes "savage." Finding "refuge" in dropping his stick, he exclaims the conclusion of his story: "<i>only the other sex was qualified for posing in the nude</i>" (<i>B</i>, 130 my emphasis). We assume that Ray has had an erection that literally disrupts the American and European modernist project. His final exclamation that "only the other sex was qualified for posing nude," indicates that in saving black men from the exoticizing primitivism of modernism, he has relinquished to that primitivism all women, including black women. Ray's emphasis on gender division reflects the view of both McKay's protagonists elsewhere in the novel. Banjo "took all women as one" (<i>B</i>, 170) and excludes Latnah, the novel's one admirable woman, from accompanying him and Ray at the end of the novel; Ray asserts, "woman is woman all over the world, no matter what her color is" (<i>B</i>, 206). McKay's novel, like his protagonists, imagines a world divided into gendered communities and alliances that overshadow its many images of black international unity.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 

<p>
For McKay, the modernist primitive is located not in statues or Paris studios, but in Banjo's black proletarian orchestra. Playing at the "biggest night" at the Caf&#x000E9; African, the orchestra "brought all the joy-lovers of darkest color together to shake that thing." Here a black proletariat produces and consumes its own modernist primitivism, sidestepping the hierarchy and alienation McKay and Rhys experienced in modernist studios. As in his description of posing, McKay reappropriates the primitive by redefining its sexuality as powerful and masculine. The narrator comments that "Negroes are never so beautiful and magical as when they do that gorgeous sublimation of the primitive African sex feeling" (<i>B</i>, 105). This "gorgeous sublimation" is strongest when men dance "male with male or individually, [rather] than with the girls" (<i>B</i>, 48). In fact, in an "exquisite movement," two men, "a coffee-black boy from Cameroon and a chocolate-brown from Dakar stand up to each other to dance a native sex-symbol dance" (<i>B</i>, 50). McKay views the U.S. as the most modern country and "the sharp, noisy notes of the banjo belong to the American Negro's loud music of life&#x02014;an affirmation of his hardy existence in the midst of <i>the biggest, the most tumultuous civilization in modern life</i>" (<i>B</i>, 49, my emphasis). McKay explicitly marks Banjo's "orchestry" as modern by making the U.S. "banjo dominat[e] the other instruments" (<i>B</i>, 49). Defined by its maleness, its homoeroticism, its internationalism and modernity, Banjo's "orchestry" illustrates how McKay's conception of the primitive counters the modernist primitivism of European artists which feminized and sexualized the primitive and made it part of a distant geography and ahistorical time.


<b></b>


<p>
The modernist primitivism McKay proposes in Banjo's orchestra is equally tailored to challenge the aesthetics of Du Bois and other Harlem intellectuals who insisted on propriety (and therefore heterosexuality) in African American art. In masculinizing the primitive, McKay also reclaims the primitive from the vastly successful Josephine Baker whose sexualized and female primitivism had taken France by storm in the years between McKay's career as a model in 1923 and his publication of <i>Banjo</i>in 1929. While Baker's primitivism earned her wealth and independence which McKay saw as signs of masculinity, McKay's own primitivist performance in modeling earned him little money and left him financially dependent, a condition his protagonist Ray describes as emasculating; it deprives him of the "free splendid spirit" he had in the U.S. as an "erect" "vagabond poet" (<i>B</i>,65). McKay's choice of words suggests the connection between (erect) male sexuality and manhood also expressed in Ray's rejection of the role of nude model.

<p>
McKay's new primitivism in <i>Banjo</i> critiques European modernity through the Chauffeur, a re based on "Le Corse." The chauffeur is a member of the proletariat who, like Le Corse, invests in prostitution in order to gain respectability. The Chauffeur uses profits from prostitutes who work for him (and sleep with him) to marry a respectable woman and to buy a home in the suburbs. He, however, "could <i>look down on the Ditch</i> [the district of prostitution] and all such places with the mean, evil, and cynical eyes of a respectable person" (<i>B</i>, 288, my emphasis). Ray presents the Chauffeur's hypocritical respectability as indicative of the larger hypocrisy of European respectability. The Chauffeur will, Ray tells Banjo, become "a respectable <i>p&#x000E8;re de famille</i>&#x02014;a good taxpayer and supporter of a<i>strong national government, with a firm colonial policy</i>" (<i>B</i>, 289, my emphasis). Ray connects the working class chauffeur to "the titled and ennobled and fashionable and snobbish gentry of this age [who] have the roots of their fortunes in the buying and selling of black bodies. And had he any reason to doubt that the landlords of Boody Lane and the Ditch as a whole were collecting that prostitute rent to live respectably and educate their children in decency?" (<i>B</i>, 288). Respectability is rotten at its core, Ray suggests, because it is handmaiden to Europe's colonialism ("the firm colonial policy") and racially exclusive, class-divided nationalism ("the strong national government" that "looks down on the ditch"). The ruling class, their lower class co-conspirators, modernist artists&#x02014;all depended on prostitution and colonialism, an international system of exploitation embedded in respectability.

<p>
<i>Banjo</i> embodies and articulates a primitivism marked by internationalism, proletarianism, and transgressive sexuality that distinguishes it not only from European modernisms, but also from most African American and Caribbean modernisms.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In McKay's modernist primitivism, as in that of Picasso and Pascin, black "primitive" culture and prostitutes are focal points. Yet whereas European modernists tended to merge black primitivism and prostitution in a colonial and heterosexual fantasy, McKay sets the primitive in an almost binary opposition to prostitution. The beach boys&#x02014;as members of an essentially male homosocial and socialist community&#x02014;stand in stark opposition to the prostitutes whose feminine world of materialism and inhumanity symbolize European capitalist modernity.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  McKay describes the black proletarian 


<b></b>


diaspora as a "primitive child, this kinky-headed, big-laughing black boy of the world" who refuses to become "the regimented creatures of civilization" and in so doing, "challenge[s] . . . civilization itself" (<i>B</i>, 314). Its no-nonsense culture, its virile homosociality and homoeroticism, its financial reciprocity defy and antagonize the united bourgeois forces of respectability, capitalism, nationalism, and colonialism. In McKay's words, "the composite voice of the Negro&#x02014;speech, song, and laughter" is the red flag to the bull of Europe's modernity. Black proletarian culture gains its power to resist from its ability to accurately name reality. In the language of the black proletariat, Ray asserts, "there were no dots and dashes . . .&#x02014;nothing that could not be frankly said . . . no actor or fact of life for which they could not find a simple passable word." From this language, Ray "gained . . . finer nuances of the necromancy of language and the wisdom that any word may be right and magical in its proper setting" (<i>B</i>, 321). The men exert their verbal power by renaming the city's districts and streets after sexual body parts and orifices in a "carnivalesque" act the Jamaican poet Louise Bennett might call "colonising in reverse." In their words, "Quartier Reserv&#x000E9;" becomes the ditch, La Rue de Bouterie Boody Lane, and the place Victor Gelu "'Bum Square'" (<i>B</i>, 9).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
Borrowing this technique of sexualizing Europe from the black proletariat, McKay employs the metaphor of Marseilles as the anus of Europe to subvert Europe's conception of itself and its modernity as masculine, active, heterosexual, and unadulterated. He describes Marseilles as "Europe's best back door, discharging and receiving its traffic to the orient and Africa" (<i>B</i>, 69) an image whose sexuality is reinforced by McKay's sensual description of the traffic in bodies and goods in and out of Marseilles. His porters are "picturesque proletarians from far waters whose names were warm with romance" (<i>B</i>, 67); their sweat mixes erotically with the smells of commodities. Exclaiming, "oh, the earthy mingled smells of the docks!" (<i>B</i>, 67), McKay lists a nearly endless catalogue of products, "dropping their stuff on the docks, reposing in the warm odor of their rich perfumes." (<i>B</i>, 67) The narrator then illustrates that the "Barrels, bags, boxes" embody the labor that produces them, the "sweat-dripping bodies of black men naked under the equatorial sun" and "brown men half-clothed . . . plucking for the Occident world its exotic nourishment of life, under the whip, under the terror." McKay concludes his description of the severity and brutality of colonial exploitation by proclaiming the exploited and violated proletarian men "full of the wonderful thing of life" (<i>B</i>, 67). Their indomitable sexuality sexualizes the trade in goods, rendering Marseilles as the recipient of their goods, ratively the passive partner in an act of anal penetration.

<p>
In defining Europe through the image of anal penetration, an act Leo Bersani and Joseph Boone see as fundamentally in opposition to the dominant construction of European subjectivity as male, white, straight, and inviolate, McKay goes beyond inverting Europe's sexual and racial hierarchies. In his analysis of T. E. Lawrence's <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> (a text published in 1926, just two years before <i>Banjo</i>, that explores same-sex desire and colonialism from a European perspective), Boone focuses on Lawrence's experience of rape as a loss of "the citadel of [his] integrity," "the only possession we are born into the world with&#x02014;our bodily integrity."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  To explain Lawrence's response, Boone cites Bersani's assertion that

<p class="noIndent">
Thus, in defining Europe as an anus that is constantly being penetrated by sexualized black and Asian men, McKay defines Europe as its own scare image. For McKay, Europe's modernity, its presumed difference and superiority, is not exactly inverted so much as destroyed by a fundamental hybridity and movement between Europe, Asia, and Africa, between modernity and primitivism, between the sexual order of the north and the sexual freedom of the south&#x02014;between the north's heterosexuality and the south's homosexuality. 

<p>
McKay shifts the center of modernity from the northern cities of Paris, London, and Berlin, to Marseilles, which as a Mediterranean capital stands at the threshold between Europe and Africa. At least since the eighteenth century, northern Europeans have associated the Mediterranean with sexual licence. A tradition of literary and social texts has defined the Mediterranean as part of a "sotadic zone," a site of homosexuality. The Mediterranean has featured in a series of travel narratives and photographs that showcased erotic portrayals of young men in southern Italy, Greece, and North Africa ("VC," 92-3).<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  In his work McKay inverts European narratives of colonial and sexual conquest, defining Europe, rather than its colonies, as the object of penetration. The penetration is itself redefined as an <i>anal</i> penetration or sodomy&#x02014;an image colonial America and Ireland used to protest their colonization by England.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Hence the significance of <i>Banjo</i>'s closing image&#x02014;Banjo and Ray, two manly men setting off to vagabond through Europe together, bring their sexuality north in order that European men may find themselves in the positions of sexual passivity that European modernity and modernism imposed on the men of Africa and its diaspora.

<p>
My argument hinges on what may appear to be a contradiction. McKay rejected the classification of homosexual for himself because of its association in dominant discourses with whiteness and effeminacy. Yet in many of his works, he asserts the legitimacy of same sex-desire (<i>GVHR</i>, 90-1, 103).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In <i>Banjo</i>, he presents the same-sex desire of individual characters as legitimate, condemns homophobic attacks on queer men, and makes male homoeroticism the foundation of his attack on Western modernity and modernism. Rather than a rejection of homosexuality, we see in McKay's novels a redefinition of black male queer identity that distances black men from the effeminacy associated with (white) homosexuality. The final image of Banjo and Ray setting off together as two strong men revises contemporary conceptions of homosexuality that required gendered partnerships between manly and feminine men. 

<p>
At the same time as McKay legitimates queer sexuality, however, he deploys practices and stereotypes associated with homosexuality as a means of condemning his ideological opponents. He uses anal penetration to attack Europe's sense of its superiority. He criticizes W. E. B. du Bois's call for a respectable black aesthetics by depicting


<b></b>


the character who articulates du Bois's uplift agenda as a weak and effeminate gay man&#x02014;a "goosey" flute boy (<i>B</i>, 88). This representation of uplift as emasculating is consistent with McKay's later assertion that "respectable Negro opinion and criticism are not ready for artistic or other iconoclasm in Negroes. Between them they would emasculate the colored literary aspirant."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 

<p>
<i>Banjo</i> thus presents conflicting images of queer sexuality. The cause of these contradictions most likely lies in McKay's investment in nationalist ideals of manhood as strong and independent, and his desire to distance black men from any association with weakness and femininity. Here I follow A. B. Christa Schwarz's persuasive argument that for McKay, the imperative to create a manly black aesthetics and community took priority over legitimizing black male same-sex desire (<i>GVHR</i>, 118). McKay's contradictory representation of gay men reveals that even as he critiques respectability and nationalism as embedded in an international system of colonial and capitalist exploitation, his conception of masculinity borrows heavily from those ideologies. His transnational, homoerotic, and anti-capitalist alternative to the respectable modern nation depended on a construction of masculinity similar to that of cultural nationalists in the anglophone Caribbean, Harlem and Europe.

<p class="noIndent">
The heroines of Rhys's 1930s novels are white women with family roots in the tropics who allow European patriarchy and capitalist modernity to wear down their slim identities and bodies. As such, they hardly seem to be engaged in the same battle as McKay and his manly black heroes. Nonetheless, nearly all Rhys's early book-length works engage critically with modernist art. While McKay addresses modernist primitivism through his black male community, Rhys does so through her white heroines who represent female and colonized identities. In "Triple Sec," <i>Quartet</i>,and <i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i>, posing for artists excludes women from respectable womanhood and even humanity, while the aging heroine of <i>Good Morning Midnight</i> reconres the power dynamics of modernist art and prostitution and participates in a new and empowering primitivism.

<p>
Rhys's first depiction of posing nude illustrates the modern artist's participation in patriarchal and colonial discourses. In "Triple Sec," an adaptation of Rhys's diaries, the heroine Suzy Gray turns to modeling as a means of gaining financial independence in the wake of sexual affairs that disqualify her for marriage. Suzy poses for Tommie, a spry and petite portrait artist, whom Carole Angier argues is William Orpen. As a realist painter, Orpen did not participate in modernist primitivism, yet he painted nudes and shared the racial and sexual assumptions underlying modernist and avant-garde representations of female nudes. His then prominent painting, "A Woman" , depicts a lithe subject, whose eye confronts the spectator and perhaps her lover as she lies at the edge of an unmade bed (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). "A Woman" outraged the bourgeoisie and caused controversy in Dublin where Orpen painted it. Orpen described the difficulty of challenging moral and aesthetic sensibilities in dramatic terms 


<b></b>


in a series of sketches which concluded with the caption, "Portrait of a young man trying the impossible in Dublin" (cited in <i>OMA</i>, 177). The model was Flossie Burnett, a working-class English woman, who was probably Orpen's lover at the time. She was also the model for his self-reflexive 1911 canvas "A model" (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). In this canvas, Orpen painted himself painting Burnett, sitting nude on the rough zebra-hide cushions of his studio couch under a framed copy of the 1906 painting (<i>OMA</i>, 179-81). Burnett's position as Orpen's lover, and the fact that she posed nude on zebra hide, indicate that even in Orpen's relatively respectable and realist studio, the female nude was often a sexualized re linked to the exotic. "The Model"  is also an important element in our discussion of Rhys because it represents the genre Rhys's literary representations of posing speak to&#x02014;the portrait of the painter and his model.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

Rhys's representation of the artist and his model reveals the hierarchical and sexual relations that Orpen's "The Model" omits. In "Triple Sec," Tommie gives voice to the exoticism and sexualization implicit in Orpen's portraits of Burnett. While Burnett appears confident and sultry in Orpen's depiction, Suzy reveals that the process of stripping in front of a painter is so humiliating it brings her to tears. Oblivious to Suzy's modesty and the respectable girlhood which taught it to her, Tommie sees Suzy only as a sexually available and beautiful woman. He announces, "I say you're . . . a beautiful person, aren't you?" He follows this up with a multitude of directions that Rhys reduces to the phrase "I want&#x02014;" followed by ellipses signaling the artist's dominance and his sexual desire. These conditions make Suzy feel "worse and worse" until she "knelt down and put [her] head on [her] arm and cried and cried."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  When she cries, he stops painting and Suzy, like <i>Banjo</i>'s Ray, has succeeded in stopping the alienating production of modern art. The effect, however, seems quite the opposite of Ray's more 


<b></b>


macho escape from modeling. Tommie uses the hiatus to literally sexualize Suzy. He takes her into his arms and kisses her, repeatedly calling her a "beautiful strange nymph" and a "strange, strange girl." His repetition of "strange" highlights the word, suggesting that it might serve also as a double entendre, punning on the French, <i>&#x000E9;trange</i>, for "foreign." Suzy immediately asks: "why do you call me 'strange'?" Tommie responds, "you are strange . . . with your slanting eyes" ("TS," 135). The slanting eyes suggests that he sees Suzy as Asian&#x02014;perhaps as part of an "orientalist" idea of sexualized woman.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Also in contrast to Ray, who rejects the exoticization and feminization of posing nude, Suzy accepts the position of sexualized and exotic nymph. She accepts the job, the kisses, and the gift of a sexy dress appropriate only for trips to find men in a club tellingly called "The Empire." Rhys emphasizes that Suzy's experience as a model excludes her from respectability when she portrays Suzy's confrontation with one of Tommie's portraits. The subject of the portrait, a wealthy English lady, insults Suzy: "Little girl, you're part of a side of life that I don't care to think about. Go away!" ("TS," 138)

<p>
Yet within this humiliating and exoticizing engagement with modern art, there lies potential for liberation. Suzy comments: "I think the work is good for me. Also his always telling me how beautiful I am is helping me to look better <i>strangely</i> enough" ("TS," 137, my emphasis). Tommie's recognition of Suzy's beauty may classify Suzy as oriental sexpot and exclude her from the colonial and respectable world of her childhood. Yet in marking their exclusion from respectable womanhood, modern art ultimately provides Rhys's heroines with the potential for countering their social alienation, just as modernist aesthetics would allow Rhys to articulate a new and critical modernist primitivism. However, Rhys's early heroines could not realize this potential until they had expressed and reconred the dynamics of modernist art.


<b></b>


<p>
For Marya Zelli, the heroine of Rhys's first novel <i>Quartet</i>, posing for artists reveals her sexual exploitation and her foreignness, her exclusion from respectable womanhood and national citizenship. In her next novel, <i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i>, however, the heroine Julia Martin sees great power in understanding or mastering the dynamics of modernist art. Julia recounts her experience as a model to George Horsfield, an Englishman who is beginning an ambivalent affair with her. Her story has the power to transform. It fills Mr. Horsfield with "warm humanity" and makes him see Julia as a human being to be treated with dignity and sensitivity. Julia explains to George that she once worked as a model for a mean artist named Ruth, and that one day she found herself telling Ruth "Everything that happened to me as far as I could" (<i>ALMM</i>, 51-2).<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  This desire to tell her life story may reflect a desire to counteract the self-negating process of being a modernist model. All the time that she tells the story, however, Julia feels judged by Ruth, and yet more importantly, by a Modigliani painting of a nude woman with a face like an African mask that looked down on her from the wall in Ruth's studio. Julia describes the nude as "having a lovely, lovely body, oh, utterly lovely" and yet being "an utterly lovely proud animal. And a face like a mask, a long dark face, and very big eyes. The eyes were black like a mask, but when you had looked at it a bit it was as if you were looking at a real woman, a live woman . . . " Julia felt the nude exerted an authority she lacked. As a consequence, she got "'a <i>beastly</i> feeling . . .&#x02014;that I didn't quite believe myself, either. I thought: 'After all, is this true? Did I ever do this?'" She perceives the modernist painting asserting "'I am more real than you. But at the same time I am you. I'm all that matters of you'" (<i>ALMM</i>, 41). This experience has a paradoxical effect. On the one hand, it makes Julia feel "beastly"--a negative version of the loveliness and pride of the painted woman's animal-ness&#x02014;and makes her see herself as identity-less. She realizes that she's lost "my marriage-book and my passport. And the papers about my baby who died and was buried in Hamburg." Without this documentation of her national citizenship and respectable womanhood, Julia feels "as if all my life and all myself were floating away from me like smoke . . . " as if she were "looking over the edge of the world" (<i>ALMM</i>, 41). At the same time, Julia recognizes this apparent loss of self as offering her great knowledge. She concludes that "I was frightened, and yet I knew that if I could get to the end of what I was feeling it would be the truth about myself and about the world and about everything that one puzzles and pains about all the time" (<i>ALMM</i>, 41).

<p>
Julia Martin stops short of articulating her feeling and gaining its power. In Rhys's next novel, <i>Good Morning Midnight</i>, however, the protagonist Sasha Jensen more successfully negotiates the power dynamics of modern art, and Rhys herself produces a new and empowering modernist primitivism. In it, the male artist paints himself as primitive, and the prostitute is a man. The heroine is a white woman from the tropics who is estranged from her husband. Rhys parallels the life of her heroine with that of a Jewish painter, a Martinican woman, and a stateless Gigolo. These parallels suggest the potential for an alliance between disparate race, class, and religious groups, marginalized and divided from each other by modern European discourses. Ultimately this alternative community is unable to cohere, but out of the parallels and alliances 


<b></b>


Rhys imagines comes a modernist art in which creator, subject, and consumer are equals in a way which recalls the power dynamics surrounding Banjo's orchestra.

<p>
<i>Good Morning Midnight</i> envisions this new modernism in the interstices of Europe's modernist capital, Paris, and in the shadow of the Exhibition Internationale des Arts et des Technique Appliqu&#x000E9;s &#x000E0; la vie moderne, which represented the hegemonic and alienating national powers of modernity (<i>JR</i>, 144). There Sasha finds herself in the studio of Serge Rubin, a modernist artist and Jewish refugee from Russia.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  This studio provides an escape for Sasha from the demoralizing alienation of modern European society; it enables her to reestablish her connections to her self and to other vulnerable people&#x02014;a Jewish refugee and an Afro-Caribbean woman particularly. It is a temporary space like the caf&#x000E9; African in <i>Banjo</i>, where the characters can produce art and in which the writer can redefine modernist primitivism. Sasha's studio and Banjo's orchestra function, I suggest, as res for Rhys's and McKay's artistic production in the interstices of European modernity. Like their protagonists, they create modernist art amid the uncertainty of imperfect social alliances, temporary shelter, and inadequate funding. These interstitial European spaces offered McKay and Rhys what the homelands they so frequently imagined could not: the opportunity to participate in and redefine modernism as well as to escape the rigid cultural and sexual expectations of Caribbean colonial society.

<p>
In Rubin's studio, Rhys and her heroine reconre the relationship of modernism to empire and primitivism. Sasha arrives not as a model, but as a potential, if impoverished, buyer. In this position of relative equality with the artist, she achieves a sense of power and self-knowledge. Unlike Suzy, Marya, or Julia, Sasha can refuse the role of primitive. She declines Serge's invitation to dance to a Martinican beguine, preferring to watch as he dances with an African mask over his face, in a move that seems to recall the blank mask face of the Modigliani nude that confronts Julia in<i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i>. Sasha asks, "'West African masks?'" and Rubin responds, "'Yes, straight from the Congo . . . . I made them.'"<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This exchange reflects two alienating elements of European modernist aesthetics. First, modernism tended to homogenize Africa (Rubin and Sasha seem to suggest that the Congo, the "heart" of Africa in much European discourse, is also West Africa). Secondly, by showing a Russian Jew making African masks, Rhys emphasizes the constructed nature of the primitive in modern art.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Further, Julia identifies the mask as representing not African culture but Englishness, commenting, "I know that face very well; I've seen lots like it, complete with legs and body . . . That's the way they look when they are saying: 'Why didn't you drown yourself in the Seine?': . . . 'Who are you, anyway? Who's your father and have you got any money, and if not, why not? Are you one of us?'" (<i>GMM</i>, 92). Rubin reinforces the association of the English with the primitive by asserting that while living in England, he felt "as if a large derri&#x000E8;re was sitting on me" (<i>GMM</i>, 81). This statement inverts the European discursive tradition of representing black sexuality by identifying large buttocks with English people rather than with the exoticized "Hottentot Venus." Rhys's depiction of the primitive as a European construction furthers the deconstruction of whiteness in many of her works. In <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> and <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>, for 


<b></b>


instance, she presents her heroines' whiteness as a relative category, fashioned through respectability, class, and geography. 

<p>
In contrast to Pascin and Modigliani, Rubin paints himself as the primitive and this new relationship between the artist and the primitive subject has a transformative effect on Sasha. She "unroll[s] the picture and the man standing in the gutter, playing his banjo, stares at me. He is gentle, humble, resigned, mocking, a little mad. He stares at me . . . I stare back at him" (<i>GMM</i>, 109). She stares at the painting, as Suzy stared at the lady's portrait and Julia stared at Modigliani's nude, but Sasha is not alienated. Rather she sees herself separated and in some ways liberated from a history of humiliation and want&#x02014;"I stare back at him and think about being hungry, being cold, being hurt, being ridiculed, as if it were in another life than this" (<i>GMM</i>, 109). Once the power dynamics of modernism have been reconred, modernist aesthetics can be used to counteract the alienating effects of high modernism on marginalized res such as white creole women.

<p>
In the Caf&#x000E9; African, McKay redefined the primitive as modern and masculine, jettisoning modern Europe's feminization of blackness. In Rubin's studio, Rhys's character begins to free herself from the alienating constraints of modern European womanhood&#x02014;the white, wealthy, wives who look down, "safe as houses," at other women who must attempt and yet always fail to conform. Rhys shows marginalized women policing and chastising themselves as they attempt and fail to meet the ideals of bourgeois womanhood. Sasha constantly monitors her performance against these standards and rails against herself when she slips. Emery observes that it is through Rubin and his artwork that "the miracle" happens and Sasha is "happy" (<i>JR</i>,83). While Rubin dances with his "African mask" to Martinican music, Sasha reconnects to her identity and rediscovers her agency. I follow Emery's reading of this scene and differ primarily in emphasis. While Emery emphasizes the mask's participation in English authority, I regard the mask as significant for modernist primitivism and Rhys's previous depictions of modernist art (<i>JR</i>, 159). All of a sudden, Sasha is "lying in a hammock looking up into the branches of a tree. The sound of the sea advances and retreats as if a door were being opened and shut. All day there has been a fierce wind blowing, but at sunset it drops. The hills look like clouds and the clouds like fantastic hills" (<i>GMM</i>,92). Emery sees in this image a photograph of Rhys her husband took on their 1936 trip to Dominica (<i>JR</i>, 158). The blurring of hills and clouds indicates that Sasha can begin to escape the constraints of her marginalized and disenfranchised place in European society and imagine herself as whole and legitimate. In contrast, when her infant son died, she chided herself for assuming that she could transcend the marginalized space society allotted her&#x02014;"the clouds are clouds, trees are trees, people are people, and that's that. Don't mix them up again" (<i>GMM</i>, 139).

<p>
It is important that this engagement with modernist primitivism corresponds to a greater identification, on Sasha's part, with her own origins and with Afro-Caribbean women. As Sasha and Rubin listen to Martinican music and discuss black music, she begins to cry; "le peintre" accepts her weeping, explaining that he too weeps. (There is a strong contrast here between Rubin and male characters in earlier novels by Rhys 


<b></b>


who respond to the heroines' sadness and malaise by alienating, seducing, or criticizing them.) Rubin tells her the story of a Martinican woman who had been made "no longer quite human, no longer quite alive" by English people who humiliated her because she was black and unmarried. Sasha exclaims that the woman is "exactly like me," because like Sasha she weeps and drinks, but Rubin convinces her that the Martinican was "not like [her] at all" (<i>GMM</i>, 79). Rhys illustrates both the similarities and differences between Sasha and the nameless woman of Martinique. Both women are excluded from respectable womanhood, but Rubin's story makes it clear that as a white woman, Sasha has escaped the physical devastation and cruel taunts inflicted on the other woman by English children. Thus while European modernism tended to blur such distinctions, Rhys delineates between white and brown creole women even as she points to the shared ground of their marginality. Sasha and Rubin strongly empathize with the Martinican woman but do not claim her experiences as their own (<i>GMM</i>, 81). The studio provides a space for this partial and temporary alliance to be imagined much as the caf&#x000E9; African provided a temporary space for McKay's community of black men. But both in <i>Good Morning Midnight</i> and <i>Banjo</i>, these new alliances and communities are vulnerable to the combined threat of nationalism and capitalism. 

<p>
Rhys's engagement with modernism and her reconration of its primitivism involves a reexamination of the nature of sexuality. Transgressing nearly all bourgeois norms for female sexuality, Rhys's heroines are in full revolt against respectable womanhood. They have affairs before and outside marriage, and fail as mothers by having abortions and letting their infant children die. This revolt also takes the form of imagining loving relationships with other women. In "Triple Sec," Suzy is loved by a friend, Jennie, who caresses her in bed, cares for her after her abortion, and introduces her to her "career of modeling." When Suzy plans to move to New York, Jennie cries: "Oh Suzy, I love you and now you're going out of my life!" ("TS," 78). In<i>Good Morning Midnight</i>, Sasha has a similarly affectionate relationship with a sad woman named Lise, whom she loves (<i>GMM</i>, 133-4).

<p>
Redefining the elements of modernist primitivism that exoticized black and female sexuality enables Sasha to love women. For Ren&#x000E9;, the gigolo in <i>Good Morning Midnight</i>, homosexuality is simply an alternative to heterosexuality. He explains to Sasha that he "tried [to love boys] in Morocco, but it was no use." However, he asks Sasha if she likes girls, and when she replies in the negative, he seems incredulous, "'What, have you never in your life seen a girl you could have loved?'" Sasha must then concur, "Yes, once I did. I saw a girl in a bordel I could have loved." Ren&#x000E9; is amused, "Oh, how convenient!" but Sasha has a different type of love in mind, much like her love of Lise. She asks herself, "Now, why has this girl suddenly come up out of the past? She wasn't beautiful, not a star at all. I expect she didn't have a very good time. But I wanted to put my arms round her, kiss her eyes and comfort her&#x02014;and if that's not love, what is?" (<i>GMM</i>, 160). In "Triple Sec," Suzy acknowledges but does not actively return Jennie's love. Having begun the process of reconring her relationship to art and men, Sasha can love a woman without placing herself in a perverse or pathological classification, which would have been impossible as the sexualized and exoticized object of the combined


<b></b>


forces of patriarchal men and modernist art. Similarly, it is only at the end of <i>Banjo</i>, once McKay has shown that European conceptions of black sexuality and respectable heterosexuality are implicated in colonial exploitation, that he can present Ray and Banjo as a pair of strong men.

<p>
These transgressive and alternative sexualities are also inextricably linked to the characters' statelessness and internationalism. Characters are able to form social and sexual alliances that counter the alienating effects of capitalism, colonialism, and bourgeois respectability only once they have physically and intellectually abandoned their nationality. Ray denounces nations as hypocritical and exploitative entities; Banjo renounces his citizenship. Sasha goes by a nationality that belongs to a lost husband and apparently has none of her own.

<p>
McKay and Rhys&#x02014;like their protagonists&#x02014;disrupt the process of modernist representation and restore agency to the objectified models in modernist art. Their rejection of the nation state and their use of transgressive sexuality as a form of resistance also had strong implications for the political and literary nationalisms emerging in the Caribbean in the 1920s and 1930s. Writers engaged in establishing national literatures were strongly influenced by European models of cultural nationalism that called for national cultures based on the folk, a population which in the Caribbean largely rejected legal marriage in favor of "common-law" unions. At the same time, these writers internalized European models of political nationalism which saw Christian marriage and middle class gender roles as necessary to modern nationhood. Thus writers invested in establishing national literatures could not completely abandon European middle class sexual and gender norms. Even writers sharply critical of respectability such as the Jamaican poet and playwright Una Marson and Trinidad's <i>Beacon Group</i> saw central elements of European marriage and gender roles as necessary to the Caribbean's new national cultures and politics. They did not therefore see the nation and respectability as McKay and Rhys saw them&#x02014;as inextricably linked to an international system of oppression structured by capitalism and colonialism. The modernism and primitivism that McKay and Rhys create thus potentially disrupted the emergent literary and political nationalisms of the Caribbean at the same time as they disrupted and challenged European modernist aesthetics.

In the absence of unequivocal evidence, Carole Angier asserts that William Orpen "is most likely" to have painted Rhys given her description of him in "Triple Sec." Angier also notes that Henry Tonks, a professor at the Slade School of Fine Arts, introduced Rhys to another painter from the school where Orpen was a student. See Carole Angier, <i>Jean Rhys: Life and Work</i> (London: Penguin, 1992 [1990]), 80.

A similar blurring and superimposition occurs in Modigliani's and Kirchner's work. Leo Kirchner, for instance, placed his female Bathers in a room framed by a stylized border derivative of housebeams from the Pelau Islands. In the same time period, he photographed two black models, Sam and Milli, also nude, in a similar frame suggesting that both occupied the same exoticized and sexualized space.

One might compare Pascin's "Temple of Beauty" with Picasso's "Olympia" , which portrays a naked, black woman, with large thighs and pelvis, displayed in a bed, next to which Picasso, small, white, and topless, sits holding fruit. The drawing stands at the end of the genealogy Gilman constructs in the representation of blackness and sexuality in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century art and other discourses. This genealogy begins with Manet's "Olympia" (1862-1863) and other contemporary artwork in which black res signal the sexuality of the scene and in particular of the displayed white woman. In Manet's "Nana"  the black re is no longer needed, Gilman argues, because black sexuality has been incorporated into the white woman's body, in the form of enlarged buttocks reminiscent of the "Hottentot Venus" ("HP," 80-102). Picasso's "Olympia" and Pascin's "Temple of Beauty" are significant because they represent sexualized black women, reworking but not significantly changing the set of equivalences between blackness, excessive sexuality, steatopygia, the primitive and prostitution that modern discourses had been negotiating for nearly a century. Picasso's "Olympia" is of particular importance to this essay because it represents the genre which McKay and Rhys themselves reworked&#x02014;the portrait of the painter with his model.

In chapter two of her current, unpublished manuscript, "Cross-Cultural Modernism: The Politics of Vision in Anglophone Caribbean Literature," Mary Lou Emery argues that Caribbeans constituted a significant presence in the modernist movements of inter-war Europe and that they produced modernist art that both contributed to and challenged high modernist aesthetics.

In emphasizing the subversive power of colonized Caribbean writers re-vising the scene of being painted, I am proposing an argument parallel to Emery's incisive analysis of postcolonial women writers' use of <i>ekphrasis</i>, the literary representation of visual art. See Emery, "Rering the Postcolonial Imagination: Tropes of Visuality in Rhys, Kincaid, and Cliff," <i>Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature</i> 16:2 (Fall 1997), 259-80, 262.

In <i>A Long Way from Home ,</i> McKay passes over the "emasculating" experience and emphasizes his close ties with the intelligentsia, Max Eastman, Paul Robeson, and Frank Harris in particular. <b></b> In <i>Banjo</i>, a book based on his experiences in France, McKay instead downplays his associations with the elites and emphasizes his protagonist's connections to the folk.

Curiously, the only painter who depicts Le Corse accurately--as a tough pimp of Marseilles&#x02014;is Ivan Opfer. I have found no artist named Opfer, but McKay describes Opfer as a well known British portrait artist. Could he be referring to William Orpen, the artist who painted Rhys? The name Opfer, which means "sacrificial victim" in German, might well be more symbolic than accurate. Opfer would be an appropriate pseudonym for Orpen, who identified so strongly with the sacrifice of WWI soldiers that, when commissioned to paint the dignitaries who signed the treaty of Versailles, he erased all the politicians and put a coffin of the unknown British soldier in their place. See <i>OMA</i>, 377-80 and Sidney Dark and P. G. Konody, <i>Sir William Orpen: Artist &amp; Man</i> (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1926), 101. McKay worked as a journalist in England at the time of the armistice and would likely have known of the controversy surrounding Orpen's painting. In <i>LWH</i>, Le Corse gives Opfer's portrait away, despite its significant value, because it renders him with a harsh honesty. Orpen was noted for his penetrating gaze and refusing to romanticize those he painted. During WWI, he worked as a war painter for the British government. In his memoir, Orpen condemns brothels and mentions frequent trips to "these dens of filth to drag fine men away from disease." See William Orpen, <i>An Onlooker in France 1917-1919</i> (Williams and Norgate: London, 1921, 16-7). His paintings, "Adam and Eve at P&#x000E9;ronne" (Plate 15) and "Changing Billets" (Plate 23), express his critical vision of prostitutes as dangerous and seductive. Thus Opfer was familiar with French brothels as were Picasso and Pascin, but unlike them, did not see prostitutes as sites of liberation from bourgeois constraints. His critical view of prostitution suggests that if he ever did paint a portrait of "Le Corse," he would have portrayed him in starkly negative terms. If Orpen is indeed the model for Opfer, it would provide further evidence that Rhys and McKay were creating modernist aesthetics in relation to the same res and issues in modern European art.

His visit with Le Corse reminds McKay of the Senegalese Senghor's request that he write a truthful account of the black men in Marseilles (<i>LWH ,</i> 288).

In his analysis of this scene, Michael North focuses on the fact that Ray is the ideal primitive because he has an intellectual and Western education. For North, the scene is significant because of McKay's successful illustration that the "'savage' is itself a civilized creation." See Michael North, <i>The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth Century Literature</i>(New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 120.

The exclusion of women from McKay's imagined black diaspora community in <i>Banjo</i> reflects his treatment of women in other works. For excellent discussions of McKay's depiction and deployment of women, see Heather Hathaway, <i>Caribbean Waves</i> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999), 60-2; 80-2; Rhonda Cobham "Jekyll and Claude: The Erotics of Patronage in Claude McKay's <i>Banana Bottom</i>," in Cindy Patton and Benigno Sanchez-Eppler, eds., <i>Queer Diasporas</i> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000),122-53, 143-8; and Barbara Griffin, "The Road to Psychic Unity: The Politics of Gender in Claude McKay's <i>Banana Bottom</i>," <i>Callaloo</i> 22:2 (Spring 1999), 499-508, passim.

As Heather Hathaway and many others have noted, McKay was not alone in turning to the primitive as an aesthetic technique and antidote to the "alienation of the modern world." See Hathaway, <i>Caribbean Waves</i>, 60. Alain Locke advocated primitivism for African American art. David Nicholls has argued that the folk and the primitive were so central to Harlem Renaissance writers that their modernist aesthetics were innovative forms of primitivism. See David Nicholls, <i>Conjuring the Folk: Forms of Modernity in African America</i> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2000), 131-3. Similarly Tracey McCabe argues that McKay belongs to a tradition of Harlem Renaissance writers who employed primitivism to articulate a black modernist aesthetic and a counter-discourse to anti-black stereotypes. McCabe argues that McKay's modernist primitivism challenges this tradition by presenting Africa in the present tense and as male rather than as a lost mother of a lost golden age. See Tracey McCabe, "The Multi-faceted Politics of Primitivism in Harlem Renaissance Writing," <i>Soundings</i> 80:4 (Winter 1997), 475-97, 478. McKay's modernist primitivism in <i>Home to Harlem</i> and <i>Banjo</i> engages a number of other intellectuals, artists, and movements&#x02014;most clearly DuBois, Josephine

Baker, a new aesthetics of imperialism. However, in order to develop the parallel with Rhys, this essay focuses exclusively on McKay's engagement with European modernist aesthetics.

In a general way, Lawrence was also part of a homoerotic European discourse on the colonized world, which Boone treats as a discourse on early gay sex tourism. I see McKay's work as responding critically to this tradition of queer European writing.

In "Rering the Postcolonial Imagination," Emery analyzes postcolonial women writers' redefinition of the tradition of <i>ekphrasis</i> as a means of resisting colonial discourse. She analyzes the same scene in <i>Jean Rhys: At World's End</i>, arguing that Julia's internalization of primitivist discourse structures her perceptions of her mother.

Coincidentally, Rubin is not unlike Jules Pascin who befriended McKay. Both were quirky modernist artists and eastern European Jews in Paris. Thus an odd parallel arises between Rhys and McKay, in that McKay's fictionalized artist Opfer is similar to Orpen who painted Rhys, and Rhys's fictional artist Rubin is similar to Pascin the artist McKay refers to in his memoirs.
