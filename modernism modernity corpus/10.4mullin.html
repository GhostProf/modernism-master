<p>
The Florida James Joyce Series, under the general editorship of the
formidable Zack Bowen, can claim much of the credit for the flourishing
North American "Joyce Industry," as it is sometimes fondly, sometimes
maliciously named. Both in convivial annual conferences in Miami,
thoughtfully planned to coincide with Joyce's birthday in frosty February,
and in the building of a Joyce list for Florida University Press, Joyce
scholarship in the United States has blossomed in the last decade,
a trend that shows little sign of reversal. The year 2002 saw five
monographs on Joyce from the Florida series, an increase in the usual
annual three. This increase is perhaps attributable to a heightened level
of interest during the buildup to the Bloomsday centenary celebrations
next year. Three of them are reviewed here, and each concentrates on
issues currently to the fore in Joyce scholarship: Joyce's treatment
of gender and sexuality; his relationship to Ireland, nationalism and
postcolonialism; his position within the cultures of modernism.
<p>
Kimberly Devlin's <i>James Joyce's "Fraudstuff"</i>is an eagerly
awaited book from one of the liveliest current thinkers on the tricky
and notoriously vexed subject of Joyce's sexual politics. It indicates
the level of interest in Devlin's work that four of the six chapters have
been partially published elsewhere; their collection together here allows
readers to appreciate the overall densely woven coherence of her argument.

<b></b>

Devlin's notion of "fraudstuff" is borrowed from <i>Finnegans Wake</i>,
and she takes it as shorthand for "an increasing concern of Joyce's
canon as a whole, his growing interest in fraudulent being and the
various theatrical props that support identity" (xi). Such a fascination
with inauthenticity and masquerade develops during the later Joyce, as
the writer moves away from his earlier <i>Dubliners</i> preoccupation
with the authentic. This preoccupation is signified both in his famous
declaration to reflect back to the Irish people a mirror image of their
own paralysis in <i>Dubliners</i>'"nicely polished looking glass," and
in the stories' dependence on blinding moments of authentic revelation,
the Joycean "epiphany."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Instead, Devlin suggests, Joyce's later writing transforms that nicely
polished looking glass into what Stephen Dedalus would later term "the
cracked looking glass of a servant," a mirror which refracts, distorts,
parodies, and celebrates its own inaccuracies of representation.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Devlin's hypothesis appears immediately convincing; all the more so when
she applies it to that most performative of all identity poses, gender.
<p>
<i>James Joyce's "Fraudstuff"</i> begins with an ingenious analysis of
the transition between the early Joyce fragment <i>Stephen Hero</i>and the
novel it would eventually become, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man</i>. The earlier Stephen rails against "mummery," whether he finds
it in the Catholic piety or the idealistic Gaelic League nationalism of
his fellow students. Accordingly, "mummery" is not a quality to be found
in the self: the Stephen of <i>Stephen Hero</i> delivers a "seriously
intended" lecture on art, and provides an eloquent undergraduate theory of
"epiphanies," both intellectual stances validated by their rejection by
an inherently fraudulent Ireland (Devlin, 7). Yet in <i>A Portrait</i>
and in <i>Ulysses</i>, the young Stephen's reliance upon masks and
disguise becomes more pronounced until he mutates in <i>Finnegans Wake</i>
into Shem the Penman, a plagiaristic, inauthentic author-persona whose
degenerate "squidself" gleefully delights in "cuttlefishing every lie
unshrinkable about all the other people in the story" (<i>Finnegans
Wake</i>, 173-4).
<p>
This first chapter acts as the overture for the rest of the book, which
explores through several brilliant close readings Joyce's increasingly
sophisticated exploration of what modern identity is. A genuinely
fruitful use of psychoanalysis, particularly Joan Riviere's seminal essay
"Femininity and the Masquerade," introduces considerations of both the
ambivalent gender identity of Leopold Bloom, Joyce's "new womanly man"
(<i>U</i> 15: 1798-9), and the strikingly theatrical manipulations of
femininity performed by, firstly, Gerty MacDowell, and secondly, Molly
Bloom. Devlin's reading of Gerty through her namesake Gertrude Flint,
the heroine of the sentimental bestseller <i>The Lamplighter</i>by Maria
Susannah Cummins, is particularly deft, as Devlin explores how Gerty's
colored narrative artfully veers between one inauthentic intertext and
another&#8212;the self-consciously artful advertizing copy of contemporary
women's magazines. Devlin reads both Molly Bloom's own adroitness at
putting on an act&#8212;"doing the indifferent"&#8212;and her ability
to perceive inauthenticity in others in an illuminating context. She
notes Molly's similarity in this regard to another of <i>Ulysses 's</i>
conspicuously unstable personalities, the nameless and evasive narrator
of the "Cyclops" episode. Two closing chapters explore Bloom's fantastic
posturings beneath the imagined surveillant gaze of Dublin's ubiquitous
police presence, and the perplexing blurring of both gender and sexuality
in <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, where male sartorial exhibitionism repeatedly
and compromisingly masks misshapen and taboo bodies and desires. As
Devlin's elegant afterword explains, Joyce's worlds of masquerade,
disguise and fraudulence are increasingly predicated upon complex
conrations of the eye, the gaze and spectacle. <i>Finnegans Wake</i>,
with its nightscape of voyeuristic scenarios and ceaselessly shifting
identities, is thus Joyce's ultimate exercise in "fraudstuff."
<p>
Andras Ungar's <i>Ulysses as National Epic</i> offers an important
investigation of the ramifications of a historical coincidence too
often overlooked in Joyce studies. <i>Ulysses 's</i> publication in 1922
collided with the foundation of the Irish Free State, and accordingly
Ungar reads the novel as an epic of the birth of a new nation. Drawing
on recent critical interest in Joyce's formative years in Trieste, Ungar
stresses how much of <i>Ulysses</i> was composed while its author also
came to political consciousness lecturing and writing on Ireland for the
newspaper <i>Il Piccolo Della Sera</i>. While Joyce's journalism and
lectures reveal his acute interest in events in Ireland following the
Easter Rising, particularly the rise of Sinn F&eacute;in and its policy
of secession, Ungar also emphazises how Trieste's colonized status as
part of the Austro-Hungarian empire provoked in Joyce an acute awareness
of the political parallels between Hungary's position within that empire,
and Ireland's relationship to Britain.

<b></b>

<p>
As Joyce freely acknowledges, such a comparison had been originally noted
in Arthur Griffith's 1904 <i>Resurrection of Hungary</i>, where Griffith
suggested Ireland look to the continent for a model for the strategy
of nationalist resistance he inaugurated the following year with the
foundation of Sinn F&eacute;in. Yet Ungar's rigorous close readings
of key episodes in <i>Ulysses</i> explore how integral Griffith's
Hungarian parallel was to the novel, as "the epic design of the work
formulates a comprehensive reflection on the historical conjunction
that in 1904 signalled the prospect of future Irish independence from
Britain" . To argue for this parallel is not, as Ungar stresses,
to suggest that Joyce either actively endorses Griffith's and Sinn
F&eacute;in's physical force brand of Irish nationalism, or overlooks
the less salubrious aspects of Griffith's program, most notably his
anti-Semitism. Rather, <i>Ulysses</i> emerges from the "raw material"
of Irish and Hungarian politics as a fable centred on Stephen Dedalus
and Leopold Bloom and dramatizing through its epic form the processes
both of nation formation and historiography.
<p>
This densely written study provides many startlingly new insights
into the tangled relationships between fiction, history and allegory in
<i>Ulysses</i>. Ungar's exploration of Stephen and Bloom's relationship in
the context of the competing two crowns of the Austro-Hungarian empire,
the crown of St. Stephen and the crown of St. Leopold, is striking both
in its ingeniousness and in the common sense of Ungar's suggestion that
the allegory is suggested only to imply in turn the strain of the unreal
universality such an allegory requires. The tension between individual
and nation, epic fable and history, is, Ungar argues, the message behind
Joyce's appropriation of the Homeric genre.
<p>
David Spurr's <i>Joyce and the Scene of Modernity</i> seems much less
coherent in its argument and focus than either Devlin's or Ungar's
studies. It is, as Zack Bowen's foreword puts it, "essentially a
miscellany of nine essays," a curious statement since I could only find
seven. The book suffers from its miscellaneous nature, although there
is much to commend in individual chapters, three of which have been
published elsewhere. The first chapter on "Colonial Spaces in Joyce's
Dublin" offers a deft reading of Joyce in the context of a Dublin
where colonial history has been liberally inscribed through the city's
architecture. To Spurr, "Joyce conceives of the city as a contested
space of imperfectly accomplished colonial domination" (Spurr, 17),
and his discussion of the "Wandering Rocks" episode offers a compelling
interpretation of the various highly ironic and frequently misinterpreted
gestures of loyalty towards the viceregal cavalcade. One chapter
examines <i>Finnegans Wake' s</i> frequent allusions to the infamous
1887 <i>Times</i> forgeries of letters linking Charles Stewart Parnell
to the Phoenix Park assassinations. It allows Spurr to blend historicism
with a Derridean meditation on forgery to show, as Devlin shows, that
questions of authenticity are at the heart of Joyce's final novel.
<p>
One of the strengths of <i>Joyce and the Scene of Modernity</i> lies
in its attempt to situate Joyce within an alternative continental
modernism, and, accordingly, two chapters compare Joyce with Proust
and Mallarm&eacute;. The Proust comparison is an intriguing one often
skirted around by Joyce scholars as Joyce's one encounter with Proust
was notoriously unproductive. Both men complained about their health
and denied that each had read the other's work. Acknowledging that "in
comparing Joyce's work to Proust's, one cannot speak of 'influence'"
, Spurr instead compares both writers' treatment of the relationship
between anti-Semitism and sexuality. What is otherwise a fruitful
comparison is unfortunately let down here by Spurr's lack of attention
to two excellent recent studies of Joyce and Jewishness, John McCourt's
<i>The Years of Bloom: James Joyce in Trieste, 1904-1920</i>  and
Marilyn Reizbaum's <i>James Joyce's Judaic Other</i> . Both books
read Bloom's characterization as "the new womanly man" via the sexual
politics of contemporary anti-Semitism, which, following Otto Weininger's
notorious <i>Sex and Character ,</i> insisted upon the effeminacy
of the Jewish male. Neither are cited by Spurr, which might explain
why he reads the often-cited "Cyclops" innuendo "I wonder did he ever
put it out of sight?" not as an anti-Semitic allusion to impotence and
effeminacy, but instead as a stereotype of the Jewish male as oversexed
. <i>Joyce and the Scene of Modernity</i> is, however, engagingly
and fluently written, doing much to make contemporary critical theory
accessible to a wider readership.
