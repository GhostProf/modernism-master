"Well--you will not be offended--you have a phrase, 'The show goes on,'

we mass observers are always on duty."

Mr. Muckerji does not know that his dutiful interviewing of neighbors
after the death of young Else Crole is putting his own life in peril: the
manageress Mrs. Mendrill is the killer, and in the passage above she is
angling to discover how much Mr. Muckerji has learned about her crime. Nor
does the dogged toiler for science realize that his conversation with her
has an unseen auditor in D., the confidential agent of Greene's title, who
is in Britain on a desperate secret mission for his war-torn continental
nation and is himself at constant risk of exposure and assassination
by the manageress and others. But then, Greene's joke centers on how
completely oblivious this diligent volunteer analyst of British society
can be to what is really going on all around him, how incapable he shows
himself of 
<b></b>
grasping the machinations and motive forces that control
his social world. Nor does the joke stop there. The notion of a (supposed)
suicide's being "of sociological importance" seems an ironic nod in the
direction of Durkheim, whose study of the phenomenon helped inaugurate,
and set the standard for, modern social thought. And Greene toys with some
ideas fundamental to Mass-Observation, that amateur research organization
of the late 1930s to which Mr. Muckerji has pledged himself. Prominent
among these is the idea of an "anthropology of ourselves" and the degree
of "distance" or alienation from a culture necessary for the scientific
understanding of it. To Mass-Observation's self-distancing proclamation
that "we are studying the beliefs and behavior of the British Islanders"
(as opposed, say, to the Trobriand Islanders of Malinowski's classic
fieldwork), Greene answers back by making his fictional mass observer "an
Indian gentleman" resident in England, to whom we are invited to ascribe
an unbridgeable detachment from, not to say a blank incomprehension of,
English culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 He also gives us the eavesdropping visitor
D., placed at a still greater remove from all things English by his
foreignness, on which the novel's other characters comment incessantly,
and by his war-transformed consciousness. The literally shell-shocked
D. makes his way through the English landscape struck dumb by the kinds
of pursuits and consciousness peace makes possible, among which must be
counted those of Mass-Observation. His puzzlement about Mr. Muckerji's
activities ("What was that? . . . He could make no sense of it") is part
of his larger bafflement in the face of all those many details of social
life, large and small, that a culture's "insiders" take for granted but
that may hold the clue to its operations and identity. As Malinowski
declared in <I>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</I> , "foolish
indeed and short-sighted would be the man of science who would pass by a
whole class of phenomena, ready to be garnered, and leave them to waste,
even though he did not see at the moment to what theoretical use they
might be put!" It was, after all, in the myriad <I>imponderabilia</I> of
native life that "the innumerable threads which keep together the family,
the clan, the village community, the tribe" were spun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 M-O,
as it came to be known, followed suit by arguing that its investigation
of Britons' smoking habits "demonstrate[d] how relevant to the structure
of society the study of small details of behaviour can be" (<I>FYW,</I>
23), and later by insisting, in an analysis of the 1938 dance craze
the Lambeth Walk, that "[i]f you are prepared to be scientific about
society, you must . . . forget your pre-conceived ideas" (<I>BM-O,</I>
140) about what will be important and what will prove fleeting or trivial.
<P>
This essay is about Mass-Observation's ways of understanding and
presenting itself, and about the influences and limitations on
its attempt at a populist auto-ethnography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 I will give
particular attention to the movement's most substantial early product, the
book-length study of British life on a single day, May 12th, 1937--George
VI's Coronation Day, which followed upon and, it was hoped, put an end
to the great national crisis of Edward VIII's abdication. The title of
the volume devoted to it is <I>May the Twelfth;</I> to avoid confusion
I will refer to the book by that name and to the day by 12 May. But
before turning to the circumstances of that book's production or the
characteristics of its form, I will be concerned with the circumstances
<b></b>
surrounding Mass-Observation's founding and the implications
arising from the way both its creators and its detractors characterized
it. Mass-Observation and <I>May the Twelfth</I> hold a particular
fascination for they occupy a force-field of many crossed and conflicting
energies associated with contemporaneous and more traditional ideas:
about temporal and spatial forms of representation, about science and art,
individual and society, official and popular, politics and anthropology,
modernism and Victorianism, nationalism and anti-nationalism.

In a manner precisely opposite to M-O's habitual practice, Graham Greene's
confidential agent finds his defining anti-self in a mass-observer. By
placing his spy momentarily in the position of an ethnographer
overhearing a busybody with scientific pretensions, Greene turns the
tables on Mass-Observation and its volunteers, "anthropologists of
themselves" who were often compared by a condescending mainstream press
to busybodies and spies (<A HREF="4.3buzard_1.html"> 1</A>). In pursuit of nothing less than the
<b></b>
democratization of social knowledge, M-O placed itself alongside a
host of spurious doubles, images of false community and false claims to
know community, implicitly defining itself as the self-knowing culture
of Britain. Preeminent among its anti-selves was that sneering official
journalism, which, M-O said, "made some show of asking the 'Man in
the Street' what he is thinking" but which was really more concerned
to mythologize the national community on behalf of the State, speaking
blithely of how, for instance, "[t]he British nation unreservedly places
its complete trust in the Prime Minister, Mr. Neville Chamberlain," during
the Munich crisis (<I>BM-O,</I> 36). Political and market research were
other prime targets: the pamphlet "A Thousand Mass-Observers" pointed
out that "Mass-Observation has been approached by politicians, and by
advertising agencies, which have suggested financing its researches for
their own benefits," but that so far such interested parties had been
held at bay.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Academic social science was intermittently
cast in the role of M-O's <I>b&ecirc;te noire,</I> except when its
imprimatur could be of assistance. The organizers made sport of the
public's greater trust in astrology than in the British Association for
the Advancement of Science (which they sophomorically abbreviated "British
Ass"), but they nonetheless sought the benediction of Malinowski--"best
known living anthropologist"
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
--and got it, qualifiedly, in
a fascinating document appended to their report <I>First Year's Work,
1937-38</I> (<I>BM- O,</I> chap. 1; <I>FYW,</I> 81-121). What
their studies often focused on, not just as objects of analysis but as
<I>competitors,</I> were the rituals or institutions that appeared to
cut across class boundaries and to actualize the larger collectivity
of all Britain. "From the enormous horoscopic data of the 1938 Press,"
M-O noted, "it is possible to construct a whole ethic of contemporary
England" (<I>BM-O,</I> 20). The Lambeth Walk could be found "in Mayfair
ball-rooms, suburban dance-halls, cockney parties and village hops"
from the southern counties up to Scotland (<I>BM-O,</I> 139). Then
there was the "new social grouping" represented by weekly football
pools such as Littlewood's, which marketed itself as a nonexclusive and
ever-expanding "Happy Circle," a "large, friendly, luck-giving group"
(<I>FYW,</I> 32, 42). Littlewood's promotional literature invoked as its
champions such national luminaries as "Lord Strabolgi, Nervo and Knox,
and King John signing Magna Charta," and it even featured a fictional
character who might have struck the M-O planners as the despicable
<I>doppelg&auml;nger</I> of their own potentially ubiquitous British
ethnographic consciousness: a re called the "Little Ol' Man o' the
Wood" who, subscribers were promised, "goes everywhere, sees everything,
and gives you the football facts you cannot obtain elsewhere" (<I>FYW,</I>
40). The Czech crisis itself and the press's handling of it must be
added to these other versions of anti-culture and anti-knowledge that
occupy so much of M-O's attention. The grim parody of national oneness
in culture took place, we are reminded, when the distribution of "[g]as
masks brought the war danger home to everybody and to every home. It
was democracy inverted--everyone had the vote, now everyone had a mask"
(<I>BM-O,</I> 88).

Aiming to close "the gap between official views and mass facts"
(<I>BM-O,</I> 196), Mass-Observation strove to make knowledge of "who we
are" no longer the preserve of "the scientific specialists, most of whose
lives are spent in laboratories and lecture 
<b></b>
rooms" and to "giv[e]
working-class and middle-class people a chance to speak for themselves,
about themselves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 "They Speak for Themselves" is the title
of more than one of the self-promotional efforts in which the movement's
founders--Charles Madge, Tom Harrisson, and Humphrey Jennings--touted
a variety of schemes designed to solicit accounts both of and by the
"unheard" British people in their everyday life (<A HREF="4.3buzard_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Like
the oppositional cultural critics of more recent years, the Mass-Observers
employed a rhetoric of Letting the Hitherto Silenced Speak, implying
that the hitherto silenced <I>had</I> a story to tell, an alternative
history or separate narrative "of their own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 "They Speak
for Themselves: Mass-Observation and Social Narrative" is the full title
of the article I have just mentioned; and the illustrative subtitle of a
contemporaneous pamphlet was "Mass-Observation Wants Your Story." David
Pocock, Director of the Tom Harrisson Mass-Observation Archive at the
University of Sussex, describes <I>May the Twelfth</I> as a subversive
counter-history "to be borne in mind whenever [one is faced] with an
'official record'" of the Coronation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 But that is to grasp
only some of the energies informing Mass-Observation. In a manner that
foreshadows our own cultural criticism, the Mass-Observers' rhetoric of
Letting the Silenced Speak was divided in itself about whether it was to
yield "<I>another</I> story," complete unto itself, or "the other side of
<I>the</I> story"--in other words, about whether it was to produce
<b></b>
a narrative of popular culture that presented that narrative and that
culture as fundamentally independent of official versions, or whether
it was to supplement the official account and therefore to complete one
grand narrative of the British national culture.
<P>
Furthermore, M-O's difficulty in deciding whether it was free of,
opposed to, or in complicity with state power to represent the people
was increased by the fact that its appeal to the idea of Speaking for
Ourselves collided with, or intertwined with, or was cross-hatched
by, other sorts of appeals that seemed at odds with narrative models
of identity and representation. These derived chiefly from the new
social science of functionalist ("cultural") anthropology and from
modernism's experiments with what Joseph Frank was to name "spatial
form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 The rhetoric of Our Own Story coexisted, in other
words, with generic impulses disruptive or suspicious of story form,
impulses under whose aegis M-O sometimes construed "the popular"
as a recalcitrant anti-narrative force--or inertia. And even these
impulses carried conflicts of their own into the M-O mix. Were models
to be taken from the emergent ethnography and modernism of the 1910s, or
from their consolidating versions of the 1930s and after? In aesthetics,
Mass-Observation was pulled in two directions: on the one hand, there was
the early, rebellious avant-gardism of Wyndham Lewis's <I>Blast</I> or of
"the Image" conceived as "anti-traditional, individualist, intuitive,
expressive"; on the other, the enshrined modernism that was M-O's
contemporary, nowhere more plainly embodied than in the "classicist,
royalist, Anglo-Catholic" Eliot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Now well on its way into
the establishment, and minus the gadfly Pound, thirties and forties
modernism in Britain had largely made its peace with nationalism,
embraced its Britishness. Auden's poetry of the early thirties often
made a specifically national address, as in the pseudo-anthropological
<I>Orators,</I> in "Look, stranger, at this island now" or in "O Love,
the interest itself in thoughtless heaven"; the Auden who left England
in the later 1930s can also be seen as a poet departing from modernism,
eager to revisit and revitalize traditional poetic forms. With an apparent
pre-1933 innocence, Stephen Spender even labeled the aesthetic of poems
like "O Love . . ." a "national socialist" one, an appellation Auden did
not repudiate (though this was before the Nazis' monopoly on its usage
became impossible to deny).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Eliot's cosmopolitan poetics of
"Jerusalem Athens Alexandria / Vienna London" were to become the poetics
of "Little Gidding," of "Now and in England."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<P>
Likewise, anthropology had passed through its militant self-advertising
stage and taken its place among the accredited disciplines; it too
had gone from stressing its boundary-defying aspects to stressing its
boundary-securing ones. Malinowski had canvassed for his new fieldworking
science by highlighting the scandalous fluidity of personality necessary
for participating in it: the expatriate anthropologist had even joked
that it was perhaps his flexible "Slavonic nature" that rendered him more
adroit at self-transformation than the more rigidly socialized English
(<I>A,</I> 21). His new intellectual enterprise had distinguished itself
with its audacious claim to deliver social knowledge by blurring the
boundaries dividing investigator from object: the participant observer
must <I>become</I> that object, however temporarily. This capacity
to 
<b></b>
set aside one's acculturated self and occupy the position of
another had gone hand-in-hand with a thoroughgoing relativism, since one
could never properly judge a phenomenon of some culture from a position
outside it. And this had placed fieldworkers under the injunction to
attend to "everything," since nothing could be judged according to
standards held before undergoing the rite of passage in the field. As
Hortense Powdermaker, one of Malinowski's first graduate students,
recalled, the master had "told us to note down everything we saw and
heard, since in the beginning it is not possible to know what may or
may not be significant."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
<P>
The Malinowski who granted Mass-Observation his partial assent in 1938
was quite a different re, not at all inclined to style his science
a nomadic one or himself an alien in Britain. He did not flinch at
the evocations of spying in the title of his essay on the movement, "A
Nation-Wide Intelligence Service"; indeed, he contrasted M-O with the
"national spy and police systems" of fascist and communist governments
(<I>FYW,</I> 121). Anthropology <I>should</I> be of "real service to the
nation," he now insisted despite some self-contradiction, and he judged
the new movement according to that criterion (<I>FYW,</I> 83). This
was not the brash &eacute;migr&eacute; of <I>Argonauts of the Western
Pacific,</I> but the author of <I>Foundations of Faith and Morals,</I>
now intent on demarcating the "legitimate faith" attached to organic
traditions like the British monarchy from the "newly manufactured pseudo
mysticisms" of Berlin, Rome, and Moscow (<I>FYW,</I> 104-5). Even
while endorsing the "Home-Coming of Anthropology" as the "inevitable
consequence" of his researches elsewhere, even while maintaining
that "[f]rom the start of my own fieldwork, it has been my deepest
and strongest conviction that we must finish by studying ourselves
through the same methods and with the same mental attitude with which we
approach exotic tribes" (<I>FYW,</I> 103), this Malinowski reaffirmed in
no uncertain terms that division between observer and observed which his
own earlier work questioned and which an Anthropology of Ourselves would
seem bound at least to qualify. The volunteer observers were once and for
all "informants," not authorized practitioners: "[t]heir statements [were]
the subject matter on which further scientific analysis is indispensable"
(<I>FYW,</I> 96; cf. 118). Bemoaning "the confusion between observer
and observed" as "the fundamental confusion that still dominates social
science," Malinowski now declared that "the distinction between . . . the
scientific approach to uncontrollable human acts and the subjective states
experienced during such acts . . . must be maintained throughout the whole
course of observation" (<I>FYW,</I> 100, 97). At issue here was nothing
so dramatic as a betrayal of previously held principles, but rather a
shift in emphasis, motivated by historical and professional factors,
from certain elements in the discipline's initial self-definition to
other elements hitherto left more or less implicit. The pressures of
totalitarianism abroad and amateurism at home encouraged the British
ethnographic authority to align his functionalism with the totalizing
aims of the nation-state and to criticize upstarts for their unmethodical
fact- and trivia-mongering. M-O's as yet unrealized potential lay for him
in its capacity to reveal "[t]he way in which . . . infinitely small,
infinitely many details of social reality work, act and integrate into
big collective movements, the manner in which they are related 
<b></b>
to
legislation, politics, declarations of policy and acts of State." This was
"the main task of social science" (<I>FYW,</I> 89). Toward the performance
of it, M-O would have to break its addiction to "the inchoate observing
of everything" (<I>FYW,</I> 85).

Understanding Mass-Observation's constitutive ambivalences helps
explain why accounts of the movement, even by its own inventors, were
so Janus-faced. Prevailing anthropological functionalism mandated that a
study of "the beliefs and behavior of the British Islanders" would be an
intentionally anti-political undertaking, directed not at producing change
or servicing interest groups but at "capturing" or "salvaging" the culture
of a whole people, setting it free of time and change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 And
yet the Anthropologists of Ourselves sometimes championed their creation
as "a political challenge of the man in the street, . . . a populist
demand that democracy should mean what it says, rule by the people,
appraised [sic] of the facts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Gayatri Spivak's delineation
of two often conflated senses of "representation"--as <I>Vertretung</I>
(political) or <I>Darstellung</I> (mimetic)--seems pertinent here:
a tendency to run together what I am calling the auto-ethnographic
gesture of Speaking <I>of </I>Ourselves and the political gesture of
Speaking <I>for</I> Ourselves was present from the start, with the
result that M-O's self-characterizations could convey alternately
<b></b>
revolutionary and totalitarian overtones.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 With its
multiplicity of viewpoints and its destabilization of the relationship
between possessor of the gaze and its object, the liberating idea of
fostering "the observation of everyone by everyone, including themselves"
could suggest a nightmare of total surveillance, the completion of that
process Foucault explored, by which the disciplining gaze is dispersed
throughout the modern social order.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The social-scientific
and press establishments were clearly motivated to present M-O in an
unflattering light, and this they did by making it appear ridiculous
or sinister by turns; but what is more striking is that the founders
themselves, and especially that genius of self-promotion, Tom Harrisson,
often took to the pages of mainstream newspapers and magazines in
order to publicize their movement in the very terms in which it was
being derided or castigated ( <A HREF="4.3buzard_3.html">3</A>, 
<A HREF="4.3buzard_4.html">4</A>). Harrisson was canny enough
to exploit the <I>frisson</I> of the thought that everybody might be
spying on everybody, a notion that could be doubly flattering, since
it implied that everybody was capable of observing and sufficiently
important to be <I>worth</I> observing. Even in soliciting amateur
observers' contributions for the day survey of 12 May 1937, M-O couched
its invitation in the intermittently alarming and titillating refrain of
"Watch yourself. And watch your neighbour."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Perhaps it is
not 
<b></b>
very surprising to learn that only a few years later, at the
beginning of the war, Mass-Observation was to embark upon a new career in
the service of the State, subcontracting with the Ministry of Information
to produce studies of public morale.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Jennings having dropped
out of the movement in 1938, Madge and Harrisson argued bitterly over
this move, with Madge warning of the "grave danger of [M-O's] becoming
propagandist" (quoted in <I>M-O:SH,</I> 39) and ultimately relinquishing
the reconstituted movement entirely to Harrisson's control by mid-1940.
<P>
My subject is the "moment" of Mass-Observation, from its founding
through the production of <I>May the Twelfth.</I> Viewed properly, it
will appear a protracted moment indeed, the understanding of which will
require that we oscillate between the late-1930s climate and traditions
of social and philosophical discourse reaching back by sometimes tortuous
paths to Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment Europe. It will also
entail paying a greater respect to Madge's and Jennings' short-lived
contributions than they tend to receive. Madge handled the loose-knit
network of volunteer observers that served as backbone for <I>May the
Twelfth,</I> and Jennings is usually credited with giving the book
what has been called its collage-like structure by cutting and pasting
together press clippings and observers' reports. Tom Harrisson, who
bore the closest approximation of anthropological credentials among the
three, had no part in the book and did not consider it to be anthropology
at all, "if by anthropology we mean not only the description but also
the integration and explanation of a whole phenomenon in its cultural
context; it was rather a detailed piece of documentation, having much in
common with the documentary film."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Yet Harrisson's adherence
to functionalist criteria may have been inappropriate to <I>this</I>
cultural context, since M-O was definitively unable to decide whether
the British culture it went in search of was something amenable to--even
longing for--totalization, or something anathema to it.

The immediate stimulus for the founding of Mass-Observation was provided
by a letter in the December 1936 issue of the <I>New Statesman</I> that
took the recent abdication crisis as evidence of the "desperate need" for
an "anthropological study of our own situation" (quoted in <I>M-O:SH,</I>
2). Poet and journalist Charles Madge responded with a letter proclaiming
the existence of a group designed to perform just that service; by chance
Madge's letter appeared alongside a poem written by Tom Harrisson based
on his recent experiences living among "cannibals" in Malekula in the New
Hebrides. Once happenstance had brought them together, however, Madge
and Harrisson soon defined their efforts in precisely complementary
terms. The editors of <I>May the Twelfth</I> tell us that
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[t]he main development of Mass-Observation has been two-fold, firstly
the network of Observers all over the country; secondly an intensive
survey of a single town. Charles Madge runs the former, Tom Harrisson
the latter. . . . The local survey starts with whole-time 
<b></b>
 research
workers studying a place from the outside and working inwards, getting
into the society, and so coming to the individual. The national plan
starts from the individual Observers and works outwards from them into
their social surroundings. [<I>MT,</I> iv-v]

<P>
Madge's "network of Observers," later to be known as the National
Panel, began with 420 respondents to the call published in the
<I>New Statesman</I> in 1937, and never grew much beyond this
number.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Working out of his home in Blackheath, Madge
dispatched regular "directives" to these volunteers, suggesting
topics to receive special attention in the reports they were to
write once a month on their everyday lives and environments. Topics
ranged from large and public to small and private, from somber to
(perhaps unintentionally) absurd: from opinions on the impending war
to observations of mantelpieces; from feelings about social class
to feelings about armpits; from anti-Semitism to "the Aspidistra
cult." Harrisson, on the other hand, set up his base of operations in
Bolton (called "Worktown" in M-O publications) and took as his objective
the study of that town's working-class culture from a standpoint
of what ethnographers had only recently begun to call Participant
Observation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 It is easy to spot the methodological faults
that litter this presumptive social science, among them the polarizing of
society and individual, the positivist fetishizing of "social facts," the
lack of representative samples. I do not mean to overlook these and other
valid criticisms that have been made of the aims, methods, and products
of Mass-Observation and more particularly of <I>May the Twelfth,</I>
but rather, having acknowledged them, to take the discussion in other
directions. Specifically, I would like to consider the complementary
metaphors of spatial relationship and of movement through space that are
used to describe M-O's methodologies--"working inwards" and "working
outwards." These function rhetorically to vouch for the relationship
between the two projects themselves, as if a project moving in one
direction and its partner moving in the other will effectively "cover
the field" or give a total account of society between them. The metaphors
also evoke the two different conceptions of anthropology that circulate
throughout the records of Mass-Observation and had not entirely sorted
themselves out in the anthropological theory of the period.
<P>
Harrisson's Worktown studies were informed mainly, though not without
much inner contradiction, by early twentieth-century practices in
ethnography and by that new science's rhetoric for defining its object
and accrediting its practitioners. This emergent and much-publicized form
of anthropology departed from its nineteenth-century ("ethnological")
forerunner in defining its object not as the singular "culture" of
humankind but as "<I>a</I> culture"--that is, a distinct, bounded network
of human relationships and meanings, one of an unspecified number of
cultures across the globe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 At the same time, it red
its practitioner as a participant observer whose first task was to get
"inside" the culture, to look at it "from inside."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In just
such terms did Harrisson, a product of Harrow and a Cambridge drop-out,
understand his and his colleagues' labors in working-class Bolton. "We
sought," he later recalled, "to fully penetrate the society we were
studying, to live in it as effective members of it and to 
<b></b>
percolate
into every corner of every day and every night of industrial life" (quoted
in <I>M-O:SH,</I> 26). In this discourse, a powerful if usually unstated
connection between cultures and specific, mappable territories of the
globe made the physical acts of entry or boundary-crossing into leading
tropes for the moral and mental reinvention of the self that would be
necessary to achieve the ethnographer's desiderata, "rapport" and the
insider's view. Just as important, of course--though more likely to be
left implicit in ethnography's early radical phase--was the injunction
that the fieldworking ethnographer get back "outside" again, or (to put
it another, related way) that enough of him <I>remain</I> outside, even
while some of him passed "in," to permit him to retain his bearings
as a scientist and be capable of producing ethnographic knowledge. In
<I>Argonauts,</I> Malinowski insisted that the ethnographer attain
the perspective of a member of the culture he studied, the goal being
"to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realise
<I>his</I> vision of <I>his</I> world"; but every professional exigency
demanded that the perspective actually amount to one of (in Bernard
McGrane's phrases) "simulated membership" or "membership without
commitment to membership."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 A practitioner's authority
hinged upon the demonstration of what we might call an <I>outsider's
insideness,</I> an achieved passage into alien lifeways that nevertheless
held any permanent "going native" to be an abdication of authority and
identity alike.
<P>
The two related ways I have mentioned above for describing the
ethnographer's condition divide between them the modern aesthetics
of representing cultures, much as the arts of time and space divide
the field of aesthetics in Lessing's <I>Laoco&ouml;n</I> and in
the theoretical legacy that descends from it. One account implies a
narrative sequence in which the successful ethnographer proceeds into
the alien culture and then out again; the other invokes a single image
of the ethnographer's simultaneous appearance on either side of the
subject/object divide, a splitting of the self that increases rather
than diminishes its authority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Of course, it is far from
clear how "cultures" can be said to be represented (in the sense of
<I>Darstellung</I>) at all, if they are conceived not as observable
phenomena (neither objects lending themselves to spatial depiction nor
events lending themselves to temporal rendering), but as the invisible
networks connecting social facts and giving those facts all the meaning
and value they are entitled to.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Practicing a "mimesis as
make-believe," however, ethnography and its precursor genres habitually
pretend to be representing cultures, by such means as the kinship diagram,
the account of some purportedly totalizing ritual, the description of
"typical" scenes, the recounting of "illustrative" native myths, songs, or
stories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 At any rate, every story told or picture painted
of a culture implied a corresponding autobiography or self-portrait
of the storyteller or painter. The ethnographic enterprise entailed
the dialectical definition of an essentially mobile or unplaceable
ethnographer, on the one hand, and an essentially immobile culture on
the other--bounded in space, its inhabitants <I>mentally</I> immobilized
or even "incarcerated" by their own adherence to custom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
The culture was paid the compliment of being seen as a social totality
<I>so</I> total, so densely integrated, that every member, object, and
event, no matter how utilitarian or banal, had its place and was suffused
<b></b>
with meaning and value;
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 but this could be so only if the
culture stayed within its semiotic and territorial boundaries, neither
contaminated by nor seeking to play a part in the anomic modernity
from which the ethnographer had come. Ethnographic cultures were to
some degree the utopian preserves of disaffected moderns, which helps
explain why they were almost always characterized as already tainted by
outside influences and in need of salvaging by ethnography. (Malinowski
speaks repeatedly of a time "in olden days" when Trobriand culture was
presumably in a condition purer than that in which he encountered it.)
<P>
This early twentieth-century ethnographic paradigm descends from German
romanticism, especially from Herder.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 But Harrisson's Worktown
study must also be seen in connection with the more recent and homespun
Victorian tradition in which, as Peter Keating writes, "a representative
of one class consciously sets out to explore, analyse and report upon, the
life of another class lower in the social scale than his own," attempting
to "become part of" the group under investigation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Revived
by Orwell, Priestley, and others in the 1930s, this tradition gives a
local, British habitation to the ethnographic implications present in
romanticism but not given full theoretical elaboration or scientific
authority until the first decades of <I>this</I> century, at which time
they were "exported" to far-flung "primitive cultures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
Describing his road to Mass-Observation on a 1938 BBC program devoted
to the movement, Harrisson recalled,

I went to an island in the Pacific called Malekula and spent three years
there living among cannibals, whom I found were neither better nor worse
than old Harrovians. I tried to get an inside picture of their customs

lived . . . Then I came back to England and went to live in a Lancashire
industrial town, trying to apply the same principles of observation to
our civilisation.

<P>
The dialectic of mobility and immobility obtained in the Victorian works,
too, for an overriding impression one gets from reading the bourgeois
literature of social exploration--from the social-problem novels as well
as from social research reports--is that "the poor" are in some powerful
sense always <I>there,</I> always where the free-ranging investigator
can find them, as if awaiting his visit to their squalid habitats. Not
only in such works as Henry Mayhew's <I>London Labour and the London
Poor</I> (1861-1862; New York: Dover, 1969), but in novels like
those of Gaskell and Disraeli, the human objects of exploration tend to
be defined (in the sense of "fenced in") in contrast to the explorer's and
the novelist's free-moving personae. Dickens carried this tendency to its
extreme in the passage in <I>Bleak House</I> when Inspector Bucket visits
the slum called Tom-All-Alone's: its denizens appear "like a concourse of
imprisoned demons," their district resembling a Dantescan circle of hell,
beyond the "verge" of which they cannot pass.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 That Dickens
recognized this for a comforting illusion, answering a need to believe
the threatening internal alien <I>containable,</I> is evident from the
plot of <I>Bleak House,</I> with the contaminating connections it draws
between Jo and Esther, Nemo and Lady Dedlock. But the illusion was the
norm. The 
<b></b>
Worktown project follows the nineteenth-century literature
of social exploration in performing the paradoxical task of elevating its
objects to a level at which they deserve bourgeois sympathy--bringing them
"closer" by showing them not as beasts or savages but as participants
in culture--while keeping them at a distance, behind that dividing wall
that secures them a culture "of their own" in the first place. And at the
same time, the social explorer emerges as someone both flexible enough to
"immerse" in the alien and proof against that destructive element into
which he has plunged.
<P>
In spite of Harrisson's characteristic bravado about the ease with which
he infiltrated the working class (he always liked to present himself as
a protean re, an unplaceable self), most of his upper-middle-class
colleagues testified to the vast "gulf that separated [them] from [the]
English workers, the gulf of education, language, accent and social
behavior."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 And this raises a crucial question. How could
the arduous border-crossing ethnographic effort they were engaged in,
this temporary occupation of, or half-inside-half-outside relation to
the space of the Other, constitute an Anthropology of <I>Ourselves?</I>
It could be accepted as doing so only from a perspective for which
the claims of the more embracing imagined community of the nation
<I>overrode</I> the relativistic claims made on behalf of the local
or class-specific (working-class) culture, even at the cost of
self-contradiction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 In "A Thousand Mass-Observers," the
authors advert to the ultimate objective of "a linking up of many
local surveys into a national survey"; elsewhere Harrisson wrote
of M-O's ultimate objective of "a cultural survey of the British
Isles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 M-O's inclination to envision this possibility, to
turn differences into mere varieties of sameness, was an overdetermined
one. Referring to the development of anthropology, we can see that behind
Harrisson's ideal lay what might have been the cautionary example of
the 1890s' Ethnographic Survey of the United Kingdom, sponsored by the
British Association for the Advancement of Science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 This
vast and ambitious undertaking was driven in part by the desire to unify
the peoples of the U.K. after a period of reawakened class and ethnic
conflict, but its abandonment in 1899 suggested that no grand theory, no
internally consistent account of the whole, would magically arise from
its tireless amassing of data. With regard to the thirties proper, Tom
Jeffery has made the valuable argument that the social crisis in Britain
between 1936 and 1939 differed from those earlier spasms of 1918 to 1924
and 1929 to 1933 in that it was felt as "affecting all classes with equal
intensity," as "characterised not by class conflict but by a felt need
for national unity, a concept likely, for many reasons, to appeal to the
middle class" (<I>M-O:SH,</I> 9). And by looking from another angle we
can note that in many ways, the thirties harked back to the Victorian
era's Hungry Forties, during which middle-class writers, politicians,
and planners also took it upon themselves to be the instruments of
a moral national unification. The mid-Victorian "Condition of England
question," the perception of Two Nations unhappily coexisting in Britain,
were reprised in Thirties Britain, and so was the assumption that the
bourgeois social researcher's efforts to understand the culture of
that Other Nation would be carried on <I>with the ultimate purpose of
subsuming that culture within the national whole.</I> To 
<b></b>
say this
is really to describe the plots of most of those social problem novels
of the 1840s and after. For works such as these, the only reason for
commencing the sympathetic ethnographic study of that so-called other
nation of the workers or the poor was that in the final analysis it
was not felt to be a different nation, people, or culture at all, but
a severed member of the British body politic that had to be sutured
back in place. In the Victorian period, the merely political unity of
a nation that had long known itself to be ethnically mixed (after the
model of Defoe's "heterogeneous thing," the "True-Born Englishman")
was called upon to do cultural work as the largest conceivable
culture there was. This is why appeals to "brotherhood" and "family"
in the social problem works were always appeals to <I>national</I>
kinship involving the sometimes explicit spurning of international
(potentially Communistic) connections. Consider, for instance, the
critique of telescopic philanthropy in Dickens' <I>Bleak House,</I> or
the arguments in Gaskell's <I>Mary Barton</I> about how employers bear
Christian responsibilities to their employees while those employees must
accept lower wages so as to defeat foreign competitors: the interests
of the two classes are shown to be the same <I>over against</I> the
interests of their counterparts in other nations. Christian universalism
notwithstanding, in Gaskell neither the British employers nor their
workers are called on to remember their Christian responsibilities
to, say, French or German workers. Mass-Observation was the inheritor
of this legacy, in which the Mayhewesque "travels into the poor man's
country" always turned into travels into our own, and ethnography of the
so-called Other Nation always turned into a more encompassing nation-wide
auto-ethnography. Speaking for Ourselves became a matter of adding our
voices to the nation's self-defining narrative.
<P>
Charles Madge's National Panel was motivated by a different sense of
anthropology, governed by metaphors of space and motion complementary to
those I have described. It is evident from sources such as the pamphlet
soliciting material for <I>May the Twelfth</I> that one of Madge's aims
was to use the resources of Mass-Observation to help people liberate
themselves from the shackles of custom and superstition, the mind-forg'd
manacles, under which they labored in contemporary Britain--such as
those surrounding the monarchy. In this, Madge drew in part upon the
modernist primitivism of decades past, which had made the likening of
Western peoples and "savages" a reflex. But he also reached back much
farther, to Enlightenment notions. In the 1784 essay that asked "What
is Enlightenment?" Kant had given the answer that it was "man's release
from his self-incurred tutelage." Those who permitted themselves to avoid
using their reason (and as Kant saw it, this included much of the world's
population and nearly all women) sentenced themselves to an everlasting
childhood and made it "easy for others to set themselves up as their
guardians."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Mass-Observation's anthropology of ourselves,
then, could also be seen as bringing critical consciousness to bear
upon our own most habitual and even sacred customs: as Kant had written
in the <I>Critique of Pure Reason,</I> "to criticism everything must
submit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 This understanding of the task was also colored by
the anxiety-ridden ideas about mass psychology which had been expressed in
works like Gustave Le Bon's 1895 study <I>The Crowd</I> and had received
a new lease on life in the era of Fascist state 
<b></b>
spectacle: the man
in the crowd "is no longer himself," Le Bon had written, "but has become
an automaton who has ceased to be guided by his will."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 And
so it is that traces of Conrad's <I>Heart of Darkness,</I> of Kant, and
of Le Bon are about equally discernible in the pamphlet "Where Were You
on May 12th?" where they mingle awkwardly with traces of that newer,
pluralist ethnography I have described above. I take the liberty of
quoting at some length. On Coronation Day, we are told,

Excitement, rising to hysteria, will fill the air. Few will stop to
consider what it is all about. They will just be carried away. The
restraints of everyday life will vanish for the time being. . . . If the
ceremony were taking place among an African tribe, it would be a wonderful
day for an explorer to observe the customs of the natives and to learn
about the working of their minds. But in England, too, we can observe
such things. We need to know more about how people behave in crowds and
masses. For mass excitement can be put to worse uses that cheering a
King and Queen driving by. Many of us remember the last war and how mass
excitement deluded us then. Again, look at Germany and Italy, and what
harm has been caused by mass hysteria there. In every country these blind
passions may turn, or be turned, into wrong and harmful directions. The
best way to guard against them is to bring them into the daylight of
science. . . . We must observe ourselves and our neighbours, and keep
constant watch on the these forces of the lower mind.

This passage expresses a powerful ambivalence about the coronation and
the point of studying it--a vacillation about the relationship between
the State and the means of representation that is not a mere flaw in
<I>May the Twelfth</I> but is its very structural principle.
<P>
Involved in this principled indecision are some conflicting senses of
the "mass" that is to pertain to Mass-Observation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The
persuasion that Britain stood in desperate need of auto-anthropologizing
can be understood as deriving from the fear that the forces of unreason
associated with humanity in the mass, and evidently on the march across
the Channel, could overwhelm British people too, making it "easy for
others to set themselves up as their guardians." "Mass-Observation wants
to find out why human beings are suggestible and how they can protect
themselves against suggestions which do not help them to survive," an
early bulletin stated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 But just as we have already needed
to see the Worktown enterprise as deriving from an eighteenth-century
model (romantic cultural pluralism) adapted to nineteenth-century
British purposes, so we will have to grasp Madge's National Panel as the
product of an Enlightenment rhetoric of self-liberation filtered through
nineteenth-century British usage. Approximating the auto-ethnographic
aim of having people speak "for themselves, about themselves" much
more closely than did Harrisson's Worktown project, the National Panel
would re its mission in tropes precisely opposite to those that
were used by Harrisson's group and inscribed in modern professional
ethnography. Instead of offering a self-authorizing narrative about the
achievement of an outsider's insideness in another culture, the producers
of the nineteenth century's signature genres--the novelists and cultural
critics--told one about a position of <I>insider's outsideness</I> with
respect to their own. This was not the unreconstructed Enlightenment
ideal of a rational standpoint outside or beyond culture, but the
auto-ethnographic 
<b></b>
 mimicry of outsideness, just as outsider's
insideness is the ethnographic mimicry of the native's position
entirely inside culture. Where ethnographers adopt a stance of
participant observation, auto-ethnographers assume one of <I>participant
objectivation</I> toward the cultures that formed them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
As with the ethnographic process, we can describe a double movement
characteristic of the auto-ethnographic: where ethnography claims to
go inside the foreign but also to remain or to get back outside it,
auto-ethnography mirrors this pattern by claiming to go outside its own
culture while also remaining in or returning to it. Instead of seeking
to demonstrate their immersion in the Other, nineteenth-century writers
testified to their "rising above" the limited perspective available to
what Matthew Arnold, in <I>Culture and Anarchy,</I> disparaged as the
"ordinary self"--a self seen as coextensive with its class and role
in society, wholly the product of socialization, wholly constrained by
sectarian enmities and neglects. In the process, they fashioned a self
(Arnold's "best self," or the self imagined by Mill's <I>On Liberty</I>)
whose putative removal from the culture that produced it is achieved
for the purpose of understanding and representing that culture and has
meaning and worth only in its continuing and continually demonstrated
connection to that culture. To continue with the metaphors: looking back
from a distance or down from a height, auto-ethnographers could perceive
the whole cultural order, whereas ordinary insider's selves saw only
part. Auto-ethnographic authority affirms the culture from which it
distances itself. One <I>needs</I> one's "mass."
<P>
Sustained by both Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment ideologies,
Mass-Observation's twin projects might imply the supersession, even
the dialectical <I>sublation,</I> of what Luk&aacute;cs had called the
"antinomies of bourgeois thought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Chief among these, for
anthropologists of Us and of Them alike, were the ideals of individual
freedom and cultural belonging, each of which came accompanied by its
negative counter-ideal: for the ideal of freedom, the vision of culture
as a prisonhouse; for the ideal of belonging, the specter of a footsore
<I>Unheimlichkeit.</I> As we have seen, the abdication crisis had supplied
one impetus for the creation of M-O by exposing "the sway of superstition
in the midst of science"
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
--and the antidote for this seems
to have been an assisted escape from self-incurred tutelage, achieveable
one volunteer at a time, not <I>en masse.</I> Viewed this way, volunteers
were not so much contributing to some collective project as assisting
themselves to rise above the superstitions of collectivity. The British
People contacted through such an enterprise fit the so-called Civic models
of nationalism, according to which subjects are linked only by the minimal
and pragmatic ties of political order and are otherwise permitted to
remain "unattached" or "at large." But the other event of late 1936 that
red in the movement's founding, especially for Madge, was the burning
of the Crystal Palace, that unparalleled symbol of Victorian national
unity constructed for the 1851 Great Exhibition. Paxton's glass-and-steel
cathedral of industry had housed the mid-Victorian extravaganza designed
to mark an end to the Hungry Forties, much as the Coronation of George
VI would present itself as marking an end--prematurely--to the great
national crises of the 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 The portion of Madge and
of M-O that 
<b></b>
responded to such appeals was the one influenced by
romantic conceptions of the nation, which favor the idea of deeper,
darker national siblinghoods. This was also the portion of M-O open to
surrealist and psychoanalytical influences, the one intrigued by the
possibility that the new science of the ordinary could give access to
"the unconscious collective life of England" in which even the most
trivial-seeming detail might signify.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Did Madge conceive
of Mass-Observation as undermining state myths of unity, like the ones
surrounding the British monarchy? Or did he intend that it should help
restore them, should rebuild the Crystal Palace in its text, much as the
Coleridge of "Kubla Khan" had promised to "build that dome in air"? Were
Mass-Observation's efforts as Madge saw them centrifugal or centripetal
in nature? As you have no doubt guessed, I will answer: both.

In the Coronation of George VI, Mass-Observation found its ultimate
anti-self (see <A HREF="4.3buzard_5.html"> 5</A>). The relationship between the events of 12 May 1937
and the Mass-Observation volume <I>May the Twelfth</I> defines a struggle
for control of the means of representation. Like the Balinese cockt
which Clifford Geertz has famously analyzed, the Coronation constituted
"a metasocial 
<b></b>
commentary," a British "reading" of British experience,
and its anthropologists tried to read it "over the shoulders" of those who
produced it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 The means in question are particularly prone to
characterization in terms of modernist aesthetics and of modern (early
twentieth-century) social thought. Rather like the Joycean artist, the
British State had converted "the bread of everyday life into something
that has a permanent artistic life of its own," making an ordinary man
into a king, a normal day into a national holy-day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Not only
had the Coronation appeared to support Durkheim's interpretation of ritual
as the enactment and symbol of collective life and as the great engine
of social consensus.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 More than this, it had furnished the
means by which the State represented <I>itself</I> as the sole entity
in Britain capable of superintending such mysteries: in anthropological
parlance, as the sorcerer or shaman who emerges as indigenous "master of
culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In an official fiction of auto-ethnography, those
who "stood for" Britons politically (representation as <I>Vertretung</I>)
and the royals who stood for them symbolically <I>(Darstellung)</I> joined
forces to claim, in effect, that they <I>were</I> Britain, and conversely
that Britons were British only in and through them. Repeatedly described
in the medieval metaphors of the body politic, these representatives were
the <I>head</I> of the British State, the <I>members</I> of Parliament,
the <I>organs</I> of the press. Virtually all their efforts to represent
Britain were susceptible to interpretation as renderings of themselves
<I>as</I> Britain. In one <I>Times</I> entry reproduced in <I>May the
Twelfth,</I> we read of discussion in Commons concerning the pricing
of seats on the Government stands for viewing the procession. Ramsay
Macdonald outlines the plan for subsidizing the price of these seats,
in the interest of "using these stands to accommodate representatives
of the many-sided life of the nation." He goes on to say that spaces
on these stands "are not to be sold to the general public but only to
persons chosen by the groups among which the representation is to be
allotted" (<I>MT,</I> 10-11). It is difficult to know which group
of national representatives here, those seated on the benches of Commons
or those to be seated on the Government stands, represents which--but
such difficulty seems to be part of the point.
<P>
<I>May the Twelfth</I> presents itself as both record of and response
to these official efforts, at once their imitation and critique. It
answers the State's quasi-Joycean magic act in a volume resembling
those great modernist day-books like <I>Ulysses, Mrs. Dalloway, The
Waves,</I> and <I>Under the Volcano,</I> which offer to contain all
life within the single day and which oscillate between the operations
of mythologizing the ordinary and "normalizing" the mythic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
Previous critics have discerned modernist techniques at work in the book:
Samuel Hynes, for instance, compared M-O's treatment of the Coronation
pageantry to the Wandering Rocks episode in <I>Ulysses</I> and to
Eliot's witheringly satirical poem on state pomp, "Coriolan," and he
noted how <I>May the Twelfth</I> "ironically counterpoints" official
and popular reports.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Others, such as Stuart Laing and
David Chaney and Michael Pickering, have likened the book's procedures
to the cross-cutting in film and emphasized M-O's connections to the

 Without disputing these
perspectives, I think we should now 
<b></b>
regard the counterpointing
or cross-cutting in relation to those disruptive textual devices
studied by Joseph Frank, through which modernist works displayed their
"spatial form"--for example, by the "interweaving of images and phrases
independently of any time-sequence of narrative" ("SFML," 49). And
a proper understanding of the use to which M-O put such devices will
take us only halfway toward an understanding of M-O's auto-ethnographic
aesthetic. As <I>May the Twelfth</I> depicts it, the State's official
auto-ethnography testified to its "coverage" of British society by
spanning the aesthetic field surveyed by Lessing's <I>Laoco&ouml;n,</I>
exploiting both temporal (narrative) and spatial (iconic, mythical) forms
to solicit Britons' investment in the rites of state. Mass-Observation's
challenge was to counteract this purportedly complete account by using
space against the official version's time, time against its space. And as
its techniques aim to negate those of the State, M-O renders itself the
"new master of social magic," the production of <I>May the Twelfth</I>
becoming "a transforming ritual curiously shamanistic in its own right,"
by means of which M-O "takes on the shaman's knowledge and authority
even as [it] represents the scientific interpretation, and hence the
secular negation, of the shaman's occult culture of magic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
<P>
The narrative which the Coronation sought to tell was one of death
and rebirth, of continuity's triumph over rupture: every coronation's
narrative is this one, though the crowning of 1937 had extra reasons
for affirming it. As the first chapter of <I>May the Twelfth</I> makes
plain, it was also a tale, especially dear perhaps to imperial powers, of
mastery over chaos. Much of this initial chapter, entitled "Preparations,"
consists of clippings from various British newspapers collected over
the three months preceding May 12th. The cumulative weight of all this
material is to give evidence of the State's determination to impress
us with its foresight and managerial expertise. The exhibits placed
on display by Madge and Jennings bear witness to the State's pursuit
of auto-ethnographic authority: they conjure up great menacing packs
of detail which the authority promises to bring to heel in producing
one orderly spectacle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 The opening chapter of <I>May
the Twelfth</I> makes plain the role of the Fleet Street press and of
Parliamentary question time in portraying the State as the one body that
can rise above, survey, and navigate the swamp of facticity surrounding
Britain's central ritual. We learn much about the careful design and
wording of the official summonses, the schemes for decorations, the
estimated cost of erecting viewing stands, the number of miles of steel
tubing needed to construct the stands ("enough to reach out from London
to Basle, in Switzerland"), the niceties of diplomacy (how to receive
the German delegation?), the arrangements for accommodations, for traffic
control, for broadcasting, for censoring of newsreel footage--and so on,
and so on. The narrative suggested by all these clippings gathers momentum
toward the inevitable destination of the crowning and seeks to engage
readers in the suspense--will the event come off, will all the dragons of
detail be slain?--of its national comic plot. This fictive-journalistic
enterprise furnished what Benedict Anderson calls "[t]he idea of a
sociological organism moving calendrically through homogeneous, empty
time," enacted through "the almost precisely simultaneous consumption
('imagining') of the newspaper-as-fiction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
<b></b>
<P>
Mass-Observation's re-presentation of this implicit official story about
the demonstratively difficult act of representation in which the State
was engaged also makes a point of demonstrating <I>its</I> difficulty,
<I>its</I> victory over facticity: we are told of M-O's "library of
press-cuttings" consisting of "about 5,000 [items]," collected "from
national and provincial newspapers and periodicals" and worked over by
editorial alchemy to yield eighty-five pages of entries. Against the
State's far-reaching network for handling the financial, technological,
and logistical dimensions of the Coronation, M-O offers its miniature
network of observers linked by mail and telephone (cf. <I>MT,</I> 89-
90). And M-O responds to the State's tale of conquest over obstacles by
scuttling the consensus-coercing momentum of its narrative, invading it
with contradictory material (on popular indifference, on plans gone awry,
on petty strife arising from the planning for the day). The most audacious
of many such juxtapositions concludes the chapter, pitting the gushing
<I>Times</I> editorial for 12 May ("The Crown is the necessary centre,
not of political life only, but of all life!") against Harry Pollitt's
message in <I>The Daily Worker</I> for the same day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 The
effect of such orchestrated clashes in the "Preparations" chapters is
not only to indicate how partial is the State's putative totalization,
but to thwart the affective allure of the form in which that totalization
sought partial expression.
<P>
The remaining sections of <I>May the Twelfth</I> have by and large a
complementary function, in reaction to the other aesthetic made use of by
the State. Like the life of the nation as it is officially represented,
the book "centers" on the twelfth of May itself, but here M-O's task is
to reconsign to "normal" temporal flux what the State presents as the
epiphanic instant of the crowning. As in modernist spatial form, in the
Coronation's climactic moment "[p]ast and present [were to be] apprehended
spatially, locked in a timeless unity"; the rite manifested itself as what
Mircea Eliade would label "a revolt against historical time," in favor
of a state of mind for which "the actions and events of a particular time
[are] only the bodying forth of eternal prototypes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Against
the ritual's powerful antihistorical, gravitational force, M-O mobilizes
that empty, homogeneous time of the everyday, charted in what come to
seem the aggressively adventitious adventures of an unsolicited populace.
<P>
This effect is nowhere clearer than in the contrast between the
officially-covered plans for the "culminating point in the Coronation
Ceremony" and the Mass-Observers' circumambulation of that moment. At
the precise instant when "Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, places
the crown on the King's head," wrote the <I>Daily Telegraph,</I>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

[t]he fact that the King has been crowned will be proclaimed officially
by the firing of guns. Elaborate arrangements are being made to ensure
that the firing synchronizes with the ceremony. Direct telephone lines
are being installed from the Abbey to artillery batteries in St. James's
Park, the Tower and Windsor, the three chief firing points. An observer
stationed in a box in the Abbey will be watching the ceremony, and the
moment the Archbishop places the crown on the King's head he will give
the signal to fire simultaneously to the batteries. The authorities
are not relying on the telephone alone. Wireless will be installed to
ensure that the firing takes place at the precise

moment. A special
signalling set is being installed on which the observer will flash a
message to the batteries. [<I>MT,</I> 15]

At 12.40 at Hyde Park Corner the sound reproduction was definitely not
good. The large numbers of wandering people distracted attention from the
Crowning. On the words "His Majesty King George VI is acclaimed" there
is a moment of indecision among the seat-holders--whether to stand up or
not--and by all whether to take off hats or not. The seat-holders cheer
first, then as the Abbey cheering comes through they stand up. About
half the men in the general crowd raise or take off their hats. Two
ice-cream boys push each other about in fun because one hasn't taken
his cap off. Then the crowd in Hyde Park cheers and the first gun
goes off. All this inside half a minute. Then someone in Piccadilly
gives a long single cheer and odd people near me laugh. As the organ
swells up a periscope-seller lurches forward with an almost drunk mock
intonation. Coming away from Hyde Park Corner the guns continue and a
little boy with his mouth full of ice-cream asks his father "What are they
firing the guns for? What are they firing the guns for?" [<I>MT,</I> 126]

"Diffusion," indeed: one feels that a more appropriate heading to such an
entry might be "Petering Out of the Message Among its Audience." A motto
for this little prose ode to the power of the quotidian is given a page
later: "Atmospherics disturb the solemn tone." The <I>Daily Telegraph</I>
had assured its public that the crowning would occur "shortly after noon,"
and that "rehearsals and tests with stop watches" would "fix the time
within two or three minutes"; <I>May the Twelfth'</I>s only account of the
moment shows it as behind schedule and badly transmitted to an uncertain
and easily distractable, yet energizingly entropic, aggregate. Ironies
attach to the fact that the setting of M-O's substitute for the magic
moment is associated with the so-called Hyde Park riots that impelled
Matthew Arnold to compose <I>Culture and Anarchy,</I> his celebration
of the State as guardian of our best self, and that its landmarks are
those commemorating the national savior, the reactionary Wellington
(Wellington Arch, Apsley House). The mock-drunken periscope seller
supplies the self-reflexive element in paragraph 54, as a kind of Lord
of Misrule whose job it is to enable people to <I>see</I> the ritual
for what it is--in other words as the re who represents it "from
the bottom up." Passages like this one throughout <I>May the Twelfth</I>
celebrate precisely what Lord Robert Cecil lamented when he wrote, after
a Victorian state spectacle, that "in England . . . some malignant
spell broods over all our most solemn ceremonials, and inserts into
them some feature which makes them all ridiculous. . . . 
<b></b>
Something
always breaks down, somebody contrives to escape doing his part, or some
bye-motive is suffered to interfere and ruin it all."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
<P>
The labor of dispelling state magic and of negating its centripetal force
is carried on by stages in <I>May the Twelfth.</I> The "Preparations"
chapter gives way to one on "London on May 12," showing the meandering
anti-pageant taking place in the city's streets, pubs, railway and tube
stations, offices, restaurants, and parks from midnight to midnight: the
authors and subjects of these entries are the milling human traffic which
the State had pledged itself to regulate--evidently with indifferent
success. They are anything but the immobilized and contacted culture
of contemporaneous ethnography or State auto-ethnography: they will
<I>not</I> keep in their places. Next comes a chapter on activities
elsewhere in Britain ("National Activities," in context an ironic title),
then one on "Individual Reactions." The impression conveyed by this steady
outward motion (from the Parliament and Abbey to the streets of London;
from London to the provinces; from the State to the individual) is the
precise opposite of the one sought through the State's system of guns,
phones, and telegraphs: an impression of the draining away of the ritual's
nation-evoking power. The book ends with a section called "The Normal Day
Survey," which appears to complete this scattering process, this return to
the mundane. Identified not as chapter five but as part two (<I>MT,</I>
vii), as if the editors want it to be seen as the structural equal of
all four chapters devoted to the Coronation, this section offers samples
from the volunteer observers' reports for 12 <I>March,</I> returning to
the editors' stated principle that "[a]s a rule, . . . Mass-Observation
will be dealing with everyday things rather than special occasions"
(MT <I>vi</I>). <I>May the Twelfth</I> contains the crucial event of
the day as an undervalued and scarcely-regarded component of its larger
vision of popular and normal life, reversing the State's attempt to
include the popular and normal as an undervalued and scarcely-regarded
(and condescended-to) component of its event: "Preparations" refers to
the "four workpeople" drawn from various portions of the nation (from
Scotland, Wales, Birmingham, and Chesterfield) who had been "surprised
and delighted" by the King's "personally inviting them to be present at
the Coronation," and to two London busmen "honoured by the King in the
Coronation Honours List" (<I>MT,</I> 6, 81). M-O's proclivity when it
operates in this mode is like that of the character Bernard in Virginia
Woolf's <I>The Waves</I> : with him it might confess, "Let a man
get up and say, 'Behold, this is the truth,' and instantly I perceive
a sandy cat filching a piece of fish in the background. Look, you have
forgotten the cat, I say."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
<P>
Not surprisingly, M-O drew fire for its "many pages of dreary minutiae,"
both from the mainstream press and from academic authorities. A reviewer
in <I>The Listener</I> complained that M-O's "facts simply multiply like
maggots in a cheese and leave no shape behind them" (cited in <I>FYW,</I>
61, 58). In "A Nation-Wide Intelligence Service," Malinowski insisted
that the movement would not arrive at the dignity of social science
until it had grasped the "clear distinction between the relevant and the
adventitious; between the sociological law . . . on the one hand, and
sundry happenings
<b></b>
 or subjective reactions on the other" (<I>FYW,</I>
85). The "indefinitely and infinitely varied minor diversities of feeling,
idea, or even behaviour" could not provide the basis for social knowledge
(<I>FYW,</I> 118). But a significant portion of Mass- Observation's vexed
principles were devoted to the adventitious and sundry, the trivial
and banal. Obstinately <I>not</I> meaning anything, not fitting in,
these were endowed with the virtue of intransigence. Like the early
T.S. Eliot of "Preludes," Mass-Observation was half in love with the
human and material detritus of modern life, which could intimate, but
stopped short of "representing,"

<P>
M-O's "suffering thing" was the mobile British populace, target of
the State's symbolic violence but stubbornly anterior to or outside of
state signification and shy of assuming alternative nationhood. Where
Malinowski wrote that "the close study of such exceptional situations [as
the Coronation] . . . may give the clue to much that is baffling in the
uniform and impassive surface of everyday things" (<I>FYW,</I> 108), M-O
would imply that normal British life afforded no mystery to be solved, no
"depth," only what there was, in plain view and plentiful supply. <I>May
the Twelfth'</I>s "neglect[ing] or tak[ing] for granted the limelight
proceedings in Westminster Abbey" struck the functionalist master as the
book's greatest failing; any respectable scientist would have focused
upon the issues of "what the function of the crowning ritual is for
the institution of monarchy, and what monarchy means for the nation"
(<I>FYW,</I> 111-12). But the self- imposed restrictions involved in
this state-favoring orientation to social research prevented Malinowski
from considering that M-O had in fact answered his question about the
crowning spectacle: "How far and in what form did it create the national
unity which it was its first and foremost task to establish?" (<I>FYW,</I>
113). His was a science that could not take "no" for an answer.
<P>
<I>May the Twelfth</I> could not "succeed," of course: what would success
mean, and how could it succeed without (or outside of) meaning? Its
insurmountable problem was not simply the (functionalist) objection facing
all Weapons-of-the-Weak approaches to the study of popular culture--namely
that in stressing the degree of freedom from state coercion and
signification achieved through the many small campaigns of the everyday,
they do not consider that the putative "subversions" they celebrate may
in the long run shore up rather than challenge authority, by siphoning
off dangerous energies in trivial or ephemeral protests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
More fundamentally, the very conception of the Normal or Popular in
Mass-Observation seemed fated to cede priority to that Official in
whose embrace it must ever lie. In <I>May the Twelfth</I> and in the
other day-surveys of 1937, the "normal day" promised sometimes to elude
official representation, sometimes to elude the order of representation
<I>tout court,</I> as something "beyond culture." Yet the very structure
of <I>May the Twelfth</I> demonstrates that mythic and normal days are
what they are only by their opposition to each other, that the Normal
is a category within and dependent upon the semiotic order of culture,
<b></b>
that it contains those signs recognized within the culture for
expressing "anti-cultural" energies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Not for nothing did
Charles Madge select the twelfth day of each month as the day about
which his volunteers should write (beginning with February 1937); this
choice was made in the knowledge that the Coronation would take place
on 12 May, so that what stood for the quotidian was grasped from the
outset by its differential relation to the Meaningful, the ritualized,
the State-controlled. Madge and Jennings seem to have been unable to
avoid giving about half of their energy to the task of completing the
one great national portrait or story, the one grand auto-ethnography,
rather than to the single-minded construction of the picture or story
of difference-within-the-nation, of difference that would never need
or tend to <I>become</I> "nation." In this they aligned themselves once
more with the latter-day modernism of their time. This was an aesthetic
whose newly learned hospitality to national traditions and resonances was
impelling it toward rations of cultural authority from the perspective
of which a nation's factions might appear, as T.S. Eliot would put it,
"[u]nited in the strife which divided them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 M-O would
have had to concur with the Auden of 1941, who bid farewell to partisan
politics and quoted Montaigne in his epigraph to <I>The Double Man:</I>

we disbelieve, and cannot rid ourselves of what we condemn."

M-O liked to exaggerate this number, referring in 1939 to "some two
thousand voluntary observers," though this would have meant counting
everyone who had responded only one time. Angus Calder gives the
re of 420, along with other res on the number of volunteers
between 1937 and 1939, in "Mass-Observation 1937-1949," in Martin
Bulmer, ed., <I>Essays on the History of British Social Research</I>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), 132; citing the work
of Nicholas Stanley, he adds that 97% of the original group were
middle class, 72% were male. Among many discrepancies between that
composition of the M-O panel and the general population, 80% of the male
participants in M-O were under 35, as compared to 53% of the general
population. Cf. Nicholas S. Stanley, <I>"The Extra Dimension": A Study
and Assessment of the Methods Employed by Mass-Observation in its First
Period, 1937-40,</I> Ph.D. diss, Birmingham Polytechnic, 1981. A
different account entirely is given in the M-O pamphlet "A Thousand
Mass-Observers" (1937 or 1938) which says "Early in 1937, fifty people in
different parts of the country agreed to co-operate in making observations
on how they and other people spend their daily lives" and that after
the appearance of and publicity given to the introductory pamphlet
<I>Mass-Observation</I> (published in June 1937 by Frederick Muller),
"more than a thousand people . . . applied to be Observers." Cf. "A
Thousand Mass-Observers," document A8, p. 2, Mass-Observation Archive.

The OED's first documented use of the phrase dates from 1924
but points to some earlier source. Cf. Eduard C. Lindeman, <I>Social
Discovery</I> (New York: Republic, 1924): "For experimental purposes the
cooperating observers have been called 'participant observers'. The term
implies, not that the observers are participating in the study but that
they are participating in the activities of the group being observed"

Consider, for example, the following passages from Powdermaker's
<I>Stranger and Friend.</I> Ethnography as an instantaneous image of
split self: "To understand a strange society, the anthropologist has
traditionally immersed himself in it, learning, as far as possible,
to think, see, feel, and sometimes act as a member of its culture and
at the same time as a trained anthropologist from another culture"
. Ethnography as a narrative sequence of entrance and withdrawal:
"Consumed with self-consciousness, I imagined my family and friends
sitting in the background and muttering in disapproving tones, 'Hortense,
dancing with the savages!' How could I get up before all these people of
the Stone Age and dance with them? . . . But there I was in my proper
place in the circle; the drums began; I danced. Something happened. I
forgot myself and was one with the dancers. Under the full moon and
for the brief time of the dance, I ceased to be an anthropologist from
a modern society. I danced. When it was over I realized that, for this
short period, I had been emotionally part of the rite. Then out came my
notebook" .

the most traditional and most expensive British public school and
university education, my father a general, family Conservative, . . . I
had been taught that cannibals were terrible, and completely inferior
to ourselves. Yet I reached the position of identifying myself, in
sentiment, with the cannibals rather than with the whites who have
tried to 'civilise' them" (n.p.). Cf. Evelyn Waugh , "The Habits of the
English," <I>The Spectator,</I> April 15, 1938: "The plan was to apply to
the British Islanders the methods of scientific anthropological research
which have hitherto been squandered on remote savages" . David Chaney
and Michael Pickering have noted M-O's reliance on the "jungle/slum
analogy" fashioned by nineteenth-century "explorers of the British
interior," especially those of the 1880s and 1890s ("DC," 45).

In her recent <I>Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation,
1830-1864</I> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995),
Mary Poovey borrows from Lorraine Daston the notion of an "historical
epistemology" whose field "allows for the production of what counts
as knowledge at any given moment" . For Daston, cf. "Historical
Epistemology," in James Chandler, Arnold I. Davidson, and Harry
Harootunian, eds., <I>Questions of Evidence: Proof, Practice, and
Persuasion Across the Disciplines</I> (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 1994), 282-89. My references to the 1840s, 1890s, and 1930s
in this section are meant to suggest that what counts as the crucial
object or horizon of knowledge also has a history. "The nation" is
always <I>there</I> throughout the century from 1840-1940, but
it periodically becomes the great desideratum of social knowledge and
representation, without which no social knowledge or representation
feels complete.
