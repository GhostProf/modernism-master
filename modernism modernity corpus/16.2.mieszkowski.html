<p>Although the past two hundred years have witnessed a host of efforts to conceptualize the extraordinary intensity and scale of military operations in the post-Napoleonic era, no agreement has been reached about whether the distinctiveness of modern warfare should primarily be regarded as a product of economic, political, or technological change. Nor has a consensus emerged as to what is at stake ideologically in treating modern conflicts as inherently more devastating than earlier ones. In these discussions, the First World War has consistently enjoyed paradigmatic status as a world-historical event of unparalleled consequences. Heralded as the original industrialized slaughter in which the boundary between the military and the civilian was all but completely dissolved, the "Great War" has also been accorded enormous cultural significance as "the moment in which the new sensibility of English—and international—modernism comes fully into existence."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> For different reasons, the Cold War has come to be viewed as uniquely formative, as well. Characterized by the efforts of its central protagonists to avoid a full-blown confrontation, this new form of permanent strife impacted every sector of society; yet it was a war based not on sustained hostilities, but on the mutual ability of the US and the USSR to maintain the threat of a nuclear exchange that neither could survive.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>At first glance, these two models of "all-pervasive" conflict appear to be diametrically opposed. The former depicts modern warfare as omnipresent, unrestrained violence, whereas the latter presents us with the constant menace of imagined violence, a possibility that can never be permitted to become a reality. In both cases, however, war is distinguished by its unlimited, and potentially interminable, nature. The thesis of this essay is that a better account of the far-reaching, often paradoxical influence <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of these two archetypes of combat is essential for understanding how major military events have shaped and continue to shape the cultural and historical consciousness of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. One of the only authors to have grasped the full implications of these dynamics, I argue, is William Faulkner. In his novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, set in Western France late in World War One, Faulkner reflects on the interplay between totality and permanence that defines the experience of a world continuously at war, offering a new vantage point from which to reconsider the ideological legacy of 1914–1918 as both the "war to end all wars" and the founding of modern military culture.</p>
<p>It is by no means clear that <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is primarily concerned with the war it overtly depicts. In proposing that nations depend on a deadlocked stalemate with their foes for their very existence, the book, written between 1944 and 1953, situates itself within the political climate that emerged in the US following the Second World War, when the interdependence of military and industrial interests became quasi-official government policy. As Noel Polk has argued:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Though set during World War I, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is really a meditation on the state of the world following World War II—it is a Cold War novel which dramatizes the inextricability of the military hierarchy from the political and economic and cultural hierarchies that run the world's nations, hierarchies that know no political boundaries and often connive with each other to insure their own survival, no matter the cost in blood to the expendable grunts who form the teeming masses of those whose lives are in their control.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">This interpretation is persuasive when one considers the regularity with which the soldiers in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> identify an abstract entity termed "greed" as the controlling force in their lives. Human combatants are repeatedly presented as existing solely in order to serve the war machine, which in turn obeys the injunctions of a military-capital logic that rapaciously demands ceaseless conflict. At the same time, the thematic prominence of World War One in Faulkner's corpus rivals even his interest in the Civil War.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In neglecting to ask why the First World War has been chosen to stand in for the Cold War, Polk overlooks a major concern of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>: How and why does the capacity to generate fictional visions of wars not yet waged become a central feature of the modern war machine? In what follows, I show that in representing the ultimate "non-shooting" war with the ultimate "shooting war," Faulkner reveals that the real legacy of the Great War lies not in its status as the standard of pure destructiveness against which all subsequent clashes must be compared, but in the way it alters the judging of military achievements such that future triumphs or defeats have to be assessed with reference to a hypothetical "super conflict" that may never come to pass. This shift in the evaluation of military ventures comes to fruition in the Cold War, where visions of apocalyptic scenarios become the medium of combat itself. By juxtaposing a period of relatively indirect conflict with the full-blown slaughter of World War One, Faulkner brings to the fore the degree to which military praxis is always as much a virtual as an actual struggle. Carl von Clausewitz's claim that the theory of warfare always leads to extremes thus finds a twentieth-century parallel in the perceived need for all war machines to establish a vision of what the ultimate war would look like.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> also suggests that uncertainties about what is meant by a modern war's "finality" unsettle the paradigm of agency on the basis of which military campaigns can be characterized as the deeds of individuals or groups. The novel's challenge to traditional conceptions of military praxis is crystallized in its re of the Unknown Soldier, who is presented as the exemplar of wartime subjectivity, as if the modern combatant were best understood with reference to an indefinite, ultimately unidentifiable entity. In this way, Faulkner offers an important alternative to the proto-fascist conceptions of the warrior-soldier that came to predominate in European military theory after 1918. Written at the height of the Cold War, his book thus seeks to articulate critical resources with which to combat ideologies of total and permanent war while at the same time casting new light on the extraordinary cultural influence of the First World War, asking how and why it invited a rethinking of both aesthetic representation and historical agency.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>The singularity of the First World War has been characterized in a host of different ways. Scholars have described the "war to end all wars" as a watershed event because of the sheer scale of the human suffering it caused and the "unprecedented levels of financial and industrial mobilization" it precipitated.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> For the first time, no inhabitant of a warring nation lived or worked outside the war effort. Of course, such absolute claims beg for qualification. Many of the elements that appear to make World War One unique were already present in nineteenth-century conflicts. The Boer, Crimean, and American Civil Wars have frequently been identified as key forerunners because they saw the deployment of industrial technology for mass slaughter and unparalleled risks for civilians. If one looks prior to the second half of the nineteenth century, it can be argued that the Napoleonic Wars witnessed a greater expansion in the scale of battle than the First World War, and the religious wars of seventeenth-century Europe offer a still earlier example of the dissolution of the distinction between military and civilian life.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Turning to events after 1918, the Second World War would appear to overshadow its predecessor. At least thirty million civilians died between 1939 and 1945 as numerous nations had their infrastructures crippled or obliterated, whereas World War One was largely a rural conflagration that left Europe's cities standing and its populations intact.</p>
<p>Debates about the cultural significance of the First World War have followed a similar pattern. Some scholars have championed the formative role of the Great War in modern aesthetics, while others have maintained that it was merely one stage in a larger developmental process. What is indisputable is that no major conflict before or since has prompted as much discussion of the relationship between a military operation and its influence, or lack thereof, on the aesthetic production of an era. For many, modernism <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> a reflection on the events of 1914–1918. As Allyson Booth has recently argued in <span style="font-style:italic;">Postcards from the Trenches</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[E]ven at moments when the spaces of war seem most remote, the perceptual habits appropriate to war emerge plainly; the buildings of modernism may delineate spaces within which one is forced to confront both war's casualties and one's distance from those casualties; the dislocations of war often re centrally in modernist forms, even when war itself seems peripheral to modernist content.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Even if one accepts this account of the radical scope of the First World War's influence, the precise contours of its legacy are far from self-evident. The claim that the war impacted the artists and writers who lived through it is presumably uncontroversial. At the same time, it is easy to observe that a number of what are today regarded as the most significant works of modernist literature were written well before the onset of major hostilities on the Continent, just as cubism, abstract expressionism, and atonal music were underway long before the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. From here, it is only a small step to suggest that World War One was merely a phase in the rise of modernism, not its formative moment. In this vein, it has been argued that the very notion of a rupture in aesthetic paradigms at the beginning of the twentieth century has been overstated and that despite the social upheaval of the war, the literary and artistic practices of the time did not exhibit the radical break with traditional forms sometimes attributed to them.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> If militarily the First World War can be said to continue longstanding trends, its supposed impact on culture can also be viewed from the standpoint of broader dynamics.</p>
<p>Whatever one's position on the First World War's historical or cultural singularity, these disputes clearly turn on the coherence of developmental models of change. In this regard, Roger Chickering has criticized modern military scholars for relying almost exclusively on a romantic coming-of-age story in which the maturation process of "total war" begins with the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era and culminates in Hiroshima, each of the key features of total war—the size of armies, the mobilization of entire economies for the war effort, improvements in killing technologies—gradually becoming manifest.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> If there is much to applaud in Chickering's critique, it is essential to recognize that the discourse on "total war" itself only comes into its own in the wake of the horrors of 1914–1918. The real question, then, is not whether World War One was the first military event to realize a new standard of destructiveness or whether it was uniquely influential for the artists and writers who reflected on it, but why it was this war that served as the impetus for the modern theorization of total war. In other words, what cultural, political, or military dynamics dictated that in the twentieth century it would become necessary to pursue state conflict in the name of "total," or "less-than-total," war?</p>
<p>The most prominent theorist of total war after 1918 was the German general Erich Ludendorff. Ludendorff did not publish his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Der totale Krieg</span> until 1935, but as early as 1919 he wrote that "it was impossible [in the First World War] to distinguish where the sphere of the army and navy began and that of the people ended."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Ludendorff's concern in reflecting on the recent struggle was to show that the German war effort—which he had largely directed from 1917–1918—had not been absolute enough; and he sought to make the case for a still broader mobilization of Germany's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  human resources if the next war was to end in victory rather than defeat.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The term "total war" thus came to serve as a name for a missed opportunity rather than a conflict that had actually transpired. Ludendorff presented past failures as the impetus for conceiving of something more extreme.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Ludendorff's vision of a truly "total" military clash was paralleled by other theorists of the interwar period, most notably the Italian advocate of airpower and strategic bombing Giulio Douhet. In 1921, Douhet proposed that "the prevailing forms of social organization have given war a character of national totality—that is, the entire population and all the resources of the nation are sucked into the maws of war. And since society is now definitely evolving along this line, it is within the scope of human foresight to see now that future wars will be total in character and scope."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> These sentiments were echoed by Ernst Jünger, who in his 1930 essay "Total Mobilization" declared that "in this unlimited marshalling of potential energies, which transforms the warring industrial countries into volcanic forges, we perhaps find the most striking sign of the dawn of the age of labor."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Jünger's remarks reveal that the nascent discourse of total war was informed by the notion that in World War One soldiering had been normalized as a routine, day-to-day economic activity, while factory and farm work had become forms of soldiering. Jünger writes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[F]ollowing the wars of knights, kings, and citizens we now have wars of <span style="font-style:italic;">workers</span>. [T]he image of war as armed combat merges into the more extended image of a gigantic labor process. In addition to the armies that meet on the battlefields, originate the modern armies of commerce and transport, foodstuffs, the manufacture of armaments—the army of labor in general. In the final phase . . . there is no longer any movement whatsoever—even that of the homeworker at her sewing machine—without at least indirect use for the battlefield.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The manner in which Jünger underscores the everyday quality of war is striking. In his terms, "total war" is the name for a situation in which labor in the service of international conflict is no longer perceived as an exceptional activity; it has acquired a permanence that makes it the norm. From this perspective, the legacy of the First World War is not its extraordinary degree of destructiveness, but the way in which it enshrined the mass support of state-sponsored struggles as a feature of the modern workplace. At the moment warfare became unspeakably horrific, the complete militarization of existence became a commonplace.</p>
<p>The point is not that between 1914 and 1918 the boundary between combatant and non-combatant disappears for the first time. In the military-economic ideologies that emerge after the Great War, the paradigm of the soldier-laborer transcends any particular manifestation of work such that the material praxis of war comes to supersede the very opposition between production and destruction. One consequence is that war can no longer be distinguished from peace by the presence (or absence) of violence. The idea of total war established in the wake of the First World War thus preres the Cold War by establishing a conceptual field in which possible and actual combat, threatened and realized aggression, are equally important dimensions of the war effort.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The question is whether this challenge to the very distinction between war and peace is an inherently regressive development, or if it can in fact prove to be the basis for a more progressive model of individual or collective agency. Precisely such a reflection on the ideologies of military praxis is at the heart of Faulkner's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, which begins by asking whether inactivity in war is as crucial as the most systematic forms of killing. The novel, which takes place during a week in France near the end of the First World War, focuses on the circumstances surrounding a mutiny and its unexpectedly drastic consequences. The narrative is punctuated by a series of conversations between combatants who ponder the loss of individual volition within the broader military-industrial dynamic that governs their existence. At first glance, the characters appear to affirm the idea that clashes between nations are driven by the overarching interests of wealth. Guided by greed, war takes priority over the people who t it, the ideals they may hope to protect, and even the notion of a foe itself. As one officer explains: "It's not we who conquer each other because we are not even ting each other. It's simple nameless war which decimates our ranks."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Cast in these terms, war is not an act of destruction but the perpetuation of life: "'The Boche doesn't want to destroy us,' said the Corps Commander, 'any more than we would want, could afford, to destroy him. Can't you understand: either of us, without the other, couldn't exist?'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 24). This delicate balance between mutually assured survival and mutually assured destruction conditions the plot throughout, forcing us to ask whether the most important events are the ones that happen or those that do not.</p>
<p>Whether he is writing about the American Civil War or later conflicts in Europe, it has been argued that Faulkner is more interested in the repercussions of war on the home front and in war's aftermath than in the travails of modern ting.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Consistent with this observation, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> has relatively little to say about the horrors of machine guns or poison gas attacks. Scenes set on the front lines unfold as if they are taking place in a stable, almost sterile environment, and even the depictions of artillery fire raining down on infantrymen assume a rather abstract tone. Given the totalizing nature of the war economy that the book examines, there is no reason to expect that it would focus exclusively on the miseries of battle, yet in fact the story does center on a bizarre turn of affairs in the day-to-day combat. On the first day of the tale, a solitary French regiment refuses orders to leave the trenches and charge across no-man's land, and as a consequence of this decision, the entire Western front comes to a standstill. "By simply declining to make an attack," one soldier explains, "one single French regiment stopped us all" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 62). The realization that armed combat can stop—that is, that the constant ting that is the very essence of perpetual war can be interrupted—shocks all the characters, not least because this unexpected event seems to occur effortlessly and instantaneously. Officers and enlisted men alike struggle to come to terms with the uncanny event by attempting, alternatively, to punish the mutineers, to celebrate or repeat the original ceasefire, or simply to recount what has transpired in new ways in an effort to situate the act within a teleological schema they can respond to or dismiss. Ultimately, Faulkner's characters are unsure whether the soldiers' non-attack should be considered an act at all. "At dawn yesterday," one officer relates, "a French regiment <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  did something—or failed to do something which a regiment in a front line is not supposed to do or fail to do, and as a result of it, the entire war in Western Europe took a recess. . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 65). In declining to follow the instruction to attack, the soldiers seemingly undermine the very distinction between heeding orders and ignoring them, and their behavior proves contagious, spreading to encompass the entire army. In this fanciful fashion, a group of soldiers institutes a local strike that becomes the grounds for a general strike, fulfilling, at least for a moment, the pacifist dream of a declaration of war that no one obeys.</p>
<p>If this impromptu strike would seem to suggest that the rank and file have the power to interrupt the business of killing, it is nonetheless far from certain that their mutiny is disruptive of the dynamic of permanent war, regardless of the degree to which this recess in battle may unsettle any simple opposition between combat and a ceasefire. On an historical level, there are several analogs in the First World War for the central event of Faulkner's tale, none of which appears to have prompted a dismantling of the war machine, either from within or without. In the so-called "Christmas Truce" of 1914, soldiers from both sides spontaneously met in the no-man's land between the trenches to exchange gifts and drink toasts. This pause in ting is said to have spread from its original manifestation near Ypres to other areas along the front, famously culminating in friendly soccer matches between British and German troops.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> This story may to some extent be apocryphal, but whatever the case, the unplanned truce clearly did not precipitate a lengthy cessation of hostilities or prevent politicians and generals from continuing their campaigns. The underlying provocation of Faulkner's version of a wartime recess, then, is the suggestion that the inactivity of the mutinous regiment is so infectious that one unit could affect the entire front, and possibly the course of the entire war. It is this logic of transmission, the communicable quality of the paralysis that emerges rather than the failure to act per se, that suggests that in this novel something fundamental has gone awry in the dynamics of military agency.</p>
<p>The possibility that the mutiny may be symptomatic of a more profound disruption of wartime praxis is reinforced by the book's depictions of crowds. In the opening pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, townspeople gather to view the captive mutineers prior to their execution.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In light of Jünger's remarks about soldiers and workers, we might expect a novel about the First World War to dwell on the degree to which individual action has been superseded by a new form of collective agency in which particular civilians or combatants no longer enjoy privileged status as victims or heroes. Yet far from offering a reflection on mass formations and mass experience, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> seems to move in the opposite direction. In this scene and on each subsequent occasion that a crowd is on the verge of acquiring decisive energy or purpose, the group's momentum stagnates, and it winds up serving as a backdrop for the distinctive volition of a single character.</p>
<p>In this context, it is also notable that one of the first things we learn about the bizarre mutiny is that if the refusal of one regiment to attack could paralyze the entire Western Front, this was not due to the crucial part played by this unit in the campaign. According to their commanding officer, the rebels' mission was "a sacrifice already planned and doomed in some vaster scheme, in which it would not matter either way, whether the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  attack failed or not: only that the attack must be made" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 19). With the empty nature of the operation in mind, the commander chooses his most expendable regiment for the task, knowing that the enemy will repel them almost immediately. The mutinous soldiers' crime is not their refusal to do anything vital, but their rejection of an act that will be worthwhile only insofar as it is a sham. What those who defied orders have unwittingly declined to do is to <span style="font-style:italic;">simulate</span> an attack; they have opted out of a plan that did not rely on their ability to meet or to fail to meet a goal. Neither a "real" thrust nor a real "feint," their decision to stay put when given the order to go over the top unsettles the opposition between war as activity and war as inactivity, if not the very distinction between action and mock action, as well. The regiment is called on to sacrifice itself, but in going on strike rather than striking out against their foes, the soldiers sacrifice their own ability to serve as a sacrifice—whether a sacrifice in the name of their own interests, the army's interests, or the extra-human demands of the war machine.</p>
<p>To grasp the status of this event within Faulkner's conception of the paradoxes of military agency that arise with permanent war, we must recognize that the initial mutiny only gains its full significance at a point much later in the book when other soldiers try to repeat Monday's bizarre act of resistance but instead bring about a bloodbath. As troops from both sides venture unarmed into no-man's land, believing that they are restaging the spontaneous truce of a few days previous, they are blown to pieces by artillery set in place by the powers that be. Throughout the novel, both the illegal act of the mutineers and the unexpected consequences of their crime prompt an extraordinarily efficient response on the part of the army commanders. As if, one character notes, the top brass had been anticipating the crisis for years, immediately after the unscripted pause in ting the shells at the front lines are replaced with duds so that a German general can safely fly over for a conference with his French, British and American adversaries in which they consider how best to continue the war, laying the groundwork for the annihilation of the soldiers who will subsequently attempt to repeat the ceasefire. In disrupting the relationship between military action and its simulation, the spontaneous truce among the rank and file exposes a further level of dissimulation in which the dueling military hierarchies are foes in name alone. In the larger logic of this permanent war, genuine combat, "real" killing, can continue only after a failed effort has been made to repeat the original inaction (the "non-act") of Monday. For Faulkner, this fundamental discord between act, agency, and telos is central to the legacy of the First World War. The events of 1914–1918 force us to consider the "totality" or "permanence" of conflicts not simply in terms of ammunition expenditures and body counts, but as a dynamic in which any given act—active or passive—is consequential only once it has been shown to have gone beyond the limits of what was possible when it occurred. An act becomes part of a <span style="font-style:italic;">total</span> war by embodying an idea of conflict that is not yet conceivable, hence, the Monday mutiny becomes significant only with the failed effort to repeat it that reveals that the original was merely the semblance of a ceasefire all along.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>This basic sequence—(dis)simulation, faux repetition, destruction—dominates the novel on all levels, from local scenes to the broader chapter-to-chapter trajectory. One <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  consequence is that each major re in the story is accompanied by an imperfect counterpart, a pseudo-double who supplements the incompleteness of the original subject. The most notable example concerns the two leaders who are punished for Monday's mutiny. The Division Commander who was nominally in charge of the disobedient regiment is shot, although in a typical rehearsal of the book's dynamic of dissimulation and destruction, he has to be shot twice, once in the back and once in the front. (In between, the first bullet wound is covered up to make the execution look more honorable.) The second leader to be punished is named the Corporal. <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, an overtly allegorical work that contains very few proper nouns, leaves no doubt that this young man is Jesus Christ. After he has finished scrounging up wine for a wedding and raising money to heal a blind woman, the Corporal and the band of twelve mutineers he heads are executed in a ritual that follows the Gospels to the letter, including a barbed-wire crown of thorns. Since the novel is set in the week before Easter Sunday, we correctly anticipate the Corporal's resurrection. Crucially, however, this occurs through a series of mishaps whereby his corpse is lost in the process of being buried and reappears when it is by chance picked up by some soldiers who have been sent to find an anonymous body that can be interred in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>
<p>Tombs of the Unknown Soldier first appeared in a number of nations directly after the First World War, initially in France and Britain, then later in the US, Italy, Belgium, and Portugal.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Their emergence at this time was due to a number of different factors. The Great War had brought unprecedented casualties and the corresponding impossibility of keeping track of the fallen bodies; but it had also witnessed a new degree of bureaucratic efficiency in the form of records listing names and deployment information for each soldier. For every field littered with unidentifiable remains, there was likely to be a precise paper trail detailing who should have been there to be found.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The impact of this disjunction was intensified by what Allyson Booth has described as the stark divide in World War One between the combatants' experience of death in the form of a landscape of omnipresent corpses and the civilian experience of death as the absence of any traces of the fallen.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> In England, newspapers were largely forbidden from publishing pictures of dead bodies, and in 1916, the British government decided that deceased combatants would not be returned for burial in the United Kingdom.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Following the Armistice, the result was a host of innovations in public mourning, all designed to cope with these new forms of absent loss. In addition to inspiring the construction of Tomb of the Unknown Soldier memorials, the First World War marked the first time that entire cemeteries were devoted solely to fallen soldiers such that the act of commemorating those killed in battle was overtly separated from the memorialization of other kinds of death. In this manner, we might say that the "Great War" became the exemplar of the war of wars because it necessitated novel social exercises in the management of mortality.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, the Unknown Soldier is an emblem for the disruptions in military praxis that emerge in a time of permanent war. In a personal letter, Faulkner explained that some friends in Hollywood suggested to him that a story about the Unknown Soldier might be useful material for a film script.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In a seminar with students at the University <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of Virginia, he went on to describe the evolution of what was to become the central plot detail of the novel:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The notion occurred to me one day in 1942 shortly after Pearl Harbor and the beginning of the last great war: Suppose—who might that unknown soldier be? Suppose that had been Christ again, under that fine big cenotaph with the eternal flame burning on it? That He would naturally have got crucified again, and I had to—then it became <span style="font-style:italic;">tour de force</span>, because I had to invent enough stuff to carry this notion. That's right, that was an idea and a hope, an unexpressed thought that Christ had appeared twice, had been crucified twice, and maybe we'd have only one more chance. . .<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">As melodramatic as this scenario may sound, Faulkner's comments about the novel's construction raise a number of interesting issues. His reference to "the beginning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">last</span> great war" points toward the way in which any account of a war after the "war to end wars" must confront the curious irony that every modern war presents itself as a kind of corrective to the conflicts that have preceded it, yet no war has convincingly brought the implied developmental sequence to a close. In other words, each modern war poses as the crowning achievement of a trend toward ever-greater destructiveness, but somehow the trend is never complete. In this regard, it is crucial to note that Faulkner ends the remarks cited above not with the proposal that a second opportunity to recognize the Messiah has been missed, but with the suggestion that although this second chance was not recognized, there could be "another" one. The pattern of repetition is explicitly open-ended. If there is always another "last" war, there is potentially always one more savior, or rather, one more chance to miss the savior. We have seen how total war theorists after the First World War called for the formulation of increasingly horrific scenarios of decimation. From the perspective of Faulkner's "other chance," however, a total war is distinguished by the way in which it both avers its own absolute character and implies that the acts that constitute this absoluteness may at some future point prove to be repeatable.</p>
<p>With the introduction of this unorthodox Messiah logic, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> upends a crucial feature of the iconography governing the burial of dead soldiers during the First World War. As George L. Mosse has argued, "the basic design of the English war cemetery brought to life the link between the fallen and Christian sacrifice with its hope of resurrection."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Indeed, Mosse, continues, "the design of the war cemeteries of most countries symbolized this relationship [between the fallen soldier and Christ] just as it is shown in the wall painting that . . . depicts a fallen soldier literally sleeping in the lap of Christ."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, it is not possible to rely on the re of Christ as the salvation for every fallen man because Christ Himself is lost, although nobody knows that this has happened. When Faulkner's Corporal leads a mutiny, is executed, and then reappears as a corpse randomly chosen to be <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> Unknown Soldier, we witness not the return of the repressed, but the return of the unrecognized. In this drastic reversal, the leader of the people—this nobody who becomes known throughout the entire army as somebody who led a mutiny for everybody—is reborn not as the Son of God who ascends to the heavens, but as the material exemplar of the unidentified, as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the body in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Once again, we encounter the book's insistent sequence of simulation, faux repetition, and destruction; but in this case, the destruction occurs first, that is, we have only the simulation of a non-identity and the repetition of a negation. Far from shedding his status as mortal in being resurrected as the Son of God, the Corporal Messiah returns—or quasi-returns—as an unknown man, or better, as the archetype of the unknown, as any nameless man. This strange turn of events cannot be characterized as a movement from a general term to a particular one, or vice versa. Neither everyman nor no-man, the Corporal is not really <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> man at all, and yet, he is no more than <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> man, either, much less <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> man.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In Faulkner's novel, the disruption of subjective agency effected by permanent war turns Christ, the ultimate re of salvation for the fallen warrior, into a generic emblem, the Unknown Soldier, someone with whom everyone can identify precisely because nobody knows who He/he is. In this respect, the Corporal distinguishes himself as a paradigmatic agent only insofar as he functions as a re for a permanent flight from his own status as unique or ideal. In this "Great Cold War," everyone—combatants and non-combatants alike—unwittingly works toward the goal of making the Unknown Soldier the model of military agency. It is therefore not enough to say that the symbolic sacrifice of the Corporal, the heroic leader of the resistance to war, is itself sacrificed. His loss becomes the memorialization of another kind of loss, the loss of individuality wrought by war. The failed sacrifice of the Corporal to the idea of subjectivity becomes a memorial to the collapse of symbolization, and the very plan of dealing with death by making monuments to the unnamed dead becomes a testament to the radically incomplete form that military agency has assumed. In this way, the novel suggests that modern war is unique because it undermines the illustrative function of exemplarity and the very idea of using a standard—e.g., of heroism—to judge particular instances of human praxis. The most pernicious "achievement" of total war may be that it hinders the ability of any individual agent to assume a representative status for agency as such.</p>
<p>In focusing on a curious interruption in battle, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> demonstrates that war negates rather than affirms the status of the human being as an entity capable of evaluating the parameters of its own historical existence. War interpellates people as agents who have lost the ability to reflect on their own mortality, agents without a capacity to come to terms with loss. If the First World War generates unique mediums of memory—military cemeteries and Tombs of the Unknown Soldier—it also unsettles the structures of self-determination that would allow such memorials to facilitate a social engagement with the dead or with death as such. In Faulkner's vision, the monuments to the fallen mark the loss of an unknown loss (the missed Messiah) rather than the catastrophic annihilation of millions of soldiers. In this respect, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is first and foremost an allegory of a collective failure to mourn. Far from inviting us to take the horrific conflicts of the First World War as an opportunity for individual redemption or as a warning of the greater destruction that humankind may inflict upon itself in the nuclear age, Faulkner reveals that wars are characterized as much by breakdowns in the symbolic logic of cultural self-insight—e.g., our failure to recognize Christ ("again")—as by a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  loss of control over the exercise of violence. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, total war—whether in the form of the First World War or the Cold War—is not principally a folly of politicians, generals, or businessmen; it is the moment when subjectivity itself goes on strike. If we do not learn from our mistakes in war, it is because war is an assault on our systems of self-understanding.</p>
<p>Psychoanalytic studies of the human experience of loss have suggested that it is only through pathological, and ultimately failed, forms of mourning that we can do justice to an absent Other without simply forgetting it or transforming it into a version of ourselves. In other words, a "successful" mourning is precisely a mourning that does not culminate in completely "getting over" what has been lost.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Only by <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> coming to terms with death can we treat the demise of an individual or a group as something other than a by-product of our fantasies of our own immortality. This is not, however, what happens in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>. Insofar as the Corporal's body is interred in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the failure to identify the Messiah does become the grounds for a memorial to anonymous loss; but this event is neither the end of the book, nor, structurally speaking, a scene of climax, resolution, or closure. Continuing with its insistent presentation of quasi-doubles, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> ends with a ceremony for a corpse that is far from anonymous. Its final scene is the funeral, ten years after the Armistice, for the Old General, the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces during the war—and, it happens, the father of the mutinous Corporal. In echoing the interment of the son, the burial of the father makes it clear that the decisive confrontation in the novel occurs neither on a battlefield nor in a cemetery, but in an officer's chambers, when the Corporal, just prior to his execution, is brought to a hearing with his father, whom he has never met. In the book's lengthiest meditation on the long-term viability of human agency in the face of permanent war, the Old General insists to his offspring that it is folly that will save man:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[I]t's not I but you who are afraid of man, not I but you who believed that nothing but a death can save him. I know better. I know that [man] has that in him which will enable him to outlast even his wars; that in him more durable than all his vices. . . the quality-mark and warrant of man's immortality: his deathless folly.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 298)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The suggestion that human survival will be ensured by thoughtless excess or extravagance rather than by rationality or a capacity for sympathy is intriguing, but it is far from obvious precisely what this means. The Old General continues by describing a future war in which machines will take over as man retires from the field, too weak to continue to participate in battle:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It will not be someone firing bullets at [man] who for the moment doesn't like him. It will be his own frankenstein which roasts him alive with heat, asphyxiates him with speed, wrenches loose his still-living entrails in the ferocity of its prey-seeking stoop. So he will not be able to go along with it at all, though for a little while longer it will permit him the harmless delusion that he controls it from the ground with buttons. Then that will be gone too; years, decades then centuries will have elapsed since it last answered his voice; he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  will have even forgotten the very location of its breeding-grounds and his last contact with it will be a day when he will crawl shivering out of his cooling burrow to crouch among the delicate stalks of his dead antennae like a fairy geometry, beneath a clangorous rain of dials and meters and switches and bloodless fragments of metal epidermis, to watch the final two of them engaged in the last gigantic wrestling against the final and dying sky robbed even of darkness and filled with the inflectionless uproar of the two mechanical voices bellowing at each other polysyllabic and verbless patriotic nonsense. Oh yes, he will survive it because he has that in him which will endure even beyond the ultimate worthless tideless rock freezing slowly in the last red and heatless sunset, because already the next star in the blue immensity of space will be already clamorous with the uproar of his debarkation, his puny and inexhaustible voice still talking, still planning; and there too after the last ding dong of doom had rung and died there will still be one sound more: his voice, planning still to build something higher and faster and louder. . .</p>

<p class="continued">There is nothing original about the suggestion that technology will inexorably supplement human powers to the point that the human species will be unable to experience the violent events it has set in motion.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> It is equally common to designate World War One as the moment in which industrialized warfare evolved such that "men now battled machines."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> More than thirty years before Faulkner's novel, Thomas Edison wrote that "if the United States engages in [this war], it will be a war in which machines, not soldiers, t. . . [T]he soldier of the future will not be a soldier, but a machinist . . ."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Beyond simply replacing human combatants with mechanical surrogates, the aesthetics of the modernist era regularly describe a fusion between the physical and the automated. As Klaus Theweleit has written, modernism's "new individual" is "a man whose physique had been mechanized, his psyche eliminated—or in part displaced into his body armor."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In stark contrast to this familiar model, Faulkner presents a future in which the <span style="font-style:italic;">corps humain</span> remains profoundly fragile. Hardly cyborgs, the human beings envisioned by the Old General are even less mechanized than at present. These denizens of the future do not change in response to technocratic forces they no longer control; they simply hide. Far from facilitating a refashioning of the human physique, technical know-how threatens to replace people entirely.</p>
<p>In the extended exchange between father and son that follows, it is often difficult to discern who is saying what, and at times, the two even finish sentences for one another, as if some grander script were being played out in which they were merely reciting their lines. In this vein, the Old General's "two mechanical voices bellowing . . . polysyllabic and verbless patriotic nonsense" can be read as a description of his encounter with his illegitimate child. In fact, the General's image of mechanical voices arguably characterizes most of the conversations in the novel: military men of various ranks bully and bluster their way through debates that sound as rote and pro forma as the names of the book's characters. On the basis of this scene, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> begins to sound like a story of machines rather than people, as if the military economy of 1918—much less 1954—were already at risk of becoming too complex to be left in the hands of human beings.</p>
<p>At the start of this essay, I proposed that Faulkner's novel explores the conflicting paradigms of permanent war offered by the First World War and the Cold War. In <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the Messiah as Unknown Soldier and the Old General's critique of military nonsense, we have seen two approaches to the fundamental crisis in agency effected by modern war and its assaults on the representational logics of the human being. We have yet, however, to consider precisely what the Old General means by man's "folly." Exactly where in this monstrous mechanical din is one to hear the "enduring inexhaustible" human voice "planning still to build something higher and faster and louder"? In 1950, six years after he had begun working on <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, Faulkner accepted the Nobel Prize in Stockholm, proclaiming:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Nobel address and the Old General's speech are clearly in dialogue with one another. At first glance, one might assume that the novel inverts the address's original meaning simply by citing it, turning the voice of soul and spirit into a mouthpiece of folly. The real target of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, however, is the inexhaustibility of voice celebrated in the Nobel acceptance speech, particularly the claim that the poet's voice can be both "the record of man" and "one of the props . . . to help him endure." Faulkner's Corporal, the Messiah, the spokesman for the faceless masses who long for nothing but the end of the war, becomes a "prop"—a cornerstone of a memorial—only through a gross mistake that in a bizarre anti-transubstantiation converts his body into something to be commemorated as forgotten. In this way, the book shows that in wartime the sacred and the singular (e.g., Christ) cannot be referred to as more or less than an anonymous corpse. Moreover, in challenging the supposedly unlimited quality of human discourse, the novel also casts doubts on its own verbal capacities. The Nobel address's "inexhaustible voice" is what the Old General would call "folly." It is a voice that mistakes itself for something more foundational than it can actually be. It is a voice that is forever divided from the image it projects of itself and yet that does not thereby become a medium for memorializing loss.</p>
<p>According to the total war theorists who emerge in the wake of the First World War, the principal task of the modern warrior is to be victorious in the trenches <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the imagination, to rule both actual wars and the visions of more horrible ones yet to come. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, such a power appears to be won only at the price of giving up on the ability to distinguish a singular event from one that is fated to be repeated again and again—be that the return of the Messiah or the killing of a nameless, faceless <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  infantryman. Does this mean that the novel offers an alternative to Jünger's fantasy of total mobilization in which the "surging forth of the masses" reveals "a new form of armament . . . one which strives to forge its weapons from purer and harder metals that prove impervious to all resistance"?<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Or should this blurring of the generic and the unique be viewed as a confusion that renders society vulnerable to the emergence of precisely the kind of collectivity Jünger or Ludendorff would celebrate?</p>
<p>Alternatively, is <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> ultimately no more than an endorsement of bourgeois individualism, its presentation of the Messiah Corporal serving as a reminder that war's fundamental horror is its disruption of the dynamics of the liberal self? In fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is much more. By challenging the idea that humankind's best defense against total war is its "inexhaustible voice," the novel warns that a critique of our militarized society has to go beyond simple condemnations of the permanent war economy of the status quo if it is to avoid becoming just one more mechanical outlet babbling "verbless, patriotic nonsense." The modern war machine wages material struggles to control bodies and machines and phantasmagoric struggles to articulate visions of unthinkably destructive conflicts. In response, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> asks us to conceive of humanity's future without laying claim, like a cold-war general, to sovereignty over imaginative prophecies of impossible battles yet to come. To combat the discourses of permanent war, we must recognize that a search for "total" conflict structures our models of subjectivity just as much as it sets the agendas of our military and industrial planners. In calling on us to realize that military ideologies have as much to say about who we are as we do, Faulkner offers a glimpse of what an alternative to our thoroughly militarized culture might be.</p>

Shortly before the close of the Second World War, Charles E. Wilson (later Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense) used his stature as president of General Motors to call on American business to avoid a return to a peacetime production program, arguing that it was necessary to maintain a "permanent war economy." Today, military spending is frequently acknowledged to be a source of enormous profit, zealously protected and nurtured by politicians and captains of industry. The cooperation between governments and multinational corporations characteristic of the "military Keynesianism" of our era ensures that business interests are furthered irrespective of whether the wars pursued by states are clashes between countries or conflicts between nation-states and extra-state entities or "networks." For some recent characterizations of these dynamics, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  see Carl Boggs, <span style="font-style:italic;">Imperial Delusions: American Militarism and Endless War</span> (New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005); David Harvey, <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Imperialism</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003); and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, <span style="font-style:italic;">Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire</span> (New York: Penguin Press, 2004).</p></div>

Thomas W. Laqueur has argued that one of the crucial innovations of the First World War was that common soldiers were no longer buried in mass graves, and elaborate efforts were made to identify their remains: "in January 1915—one can date this remarkable change with a precision not usual in cultural history—a new era of remembrance began: the era of the common soldier's name or its self-conscious and sacralized oblivion. Common soldiers ceased to be 'buried where they fell—in the fields, in the roadsides, sometimes singly, sometimes together'; it became his and his colleagues' job, writes a member of a British Red Cross unit in his war diary, 'to search for graves, identify soldiers, mark them with a cross, register their position'" (Thomas W. Laqueur, "Memory and Naming in the Great War," <span style="font-style:italic;">Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity</span>, ed. John R. Gillis [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994], 152).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f31" href="#f31-text">31. </a>The traditional understanding of the Unknown Soldier is that the re's lack of identity allows for a multiplicity of identifications that facilitate national unity through their transcendence of class and race distinctions. As G. Kurt Piehler has argued: "Why did American venerate the Unknown Soldier? In one sense, his very lack of an individual identity permitted almost everyone to claim the Unknown Soldier as his or her own" ("The War Dead and the Gold Star: American Commemoration of the First World War," <span style="font-style:italic;">Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity</span>, ed. John R. Gillis [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994], 173). Laqueur goes even further in stressing the flexibility of the re: "While the names and markers that gird the battlefields of France and Belgium cry out in their specificity, their one-to-one correspondence with a body at, or near, the place of the sign, the unknown warrior becomes in his universality the cipher that can mean anything, the bones <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that represent any and all bones equally well or badly" ("Memory and Naming in the Great War," 158). Hannah Arendt offers a slightly different account: "The monuments to the 'Unknown Soldier' after World War I bear testimony to the then still existing need for glorification, for finding a 'who,' an identifiable somebody whom four years of mass slaughter should have revealed. The frustration of this wish and the unwillingness to resign oneself to the brutal fact that the agent of the war was actually nobody inspired the erection of the monuments to the 'unknown,' to all those whom the war had failed to make known and had robbed thereby, not of their achievement, but of their human dignity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Human Condition</span> [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998], 181). It is in this vein that Arendt suggests that <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> "surpasses almost all of World War I literature in perceptiveness and clarity because its hero is the Unknown Soldier" (181 n.5).</p></div>
