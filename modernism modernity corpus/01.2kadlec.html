<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 1912 members of the American Academy of Medicine gathered in
Atlantic City for a conference on medical problems of immigration. Among
the papers presented that year was a Marine Hospital officer's account
of "The Medical Examination of Arriving Aliens." Dr. Leland E. Cofer
described the screening procedures administered to the three to five
thousand immigrants--mostly Italian, Russian, Slovak, and Polish--now
landing daily at New York's Ellis Island:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the case of the large stations...it has been necessary to effect an
organization by which the mentally sound immi-grants can be eliminated
from the line.... On the average line...there are never less than two
men on duty, and usually                  three or four.... If one of the
medical examiners sees one of the stigmata of mental degeneracy, a certain
mark is put in white or colored chalk on the immigrant's clothing. Every
other medical examiner noticing this as the immigrant comes down the
line knows the meaning of it. The next medical examiner may discover some
deformity, in which case another check mark is placed on the clothing of
the immigrant. Finally the examiner detailed for the eyes may discover
a...defect...in which case another mark is placed on the clothing of
the immigrant, so that when he is pre-sented later in a private room for
further examination, no less than three men are called upon to demonstrate
the                     presence of the disease....

"the stigmata of mental

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asked once about her work's layout and typography, Marianne Moore claimed
never to have planned the odd shapes of her trademark syllabic stanzas:
"Words cluster like chromosomes, determining the procedure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

The genetic metaphor is certainly an important one for the kind of
poetry Moore was writing during the first decades of the century; but
her answer to Donald Hall was an artist's evasion. Moore's verse was
crafted. By the early twenties the poet was known for her practice of
sifting through various printed materials--natural histories, travel
guides, Protestant divine tracts, magazine ads and feature articles--and
singling out sentences and phrases, circling words that rhymed, and then
connecting these with penciled lines. From splices in paraphrase and in
quotation she sometimes then patterned out rhymed syllabic stanzas, and
sometimes buried her rhymes in free verse. "When the poem reached a stage
that pleased her, she turned to the typewriter, often making multiple
carbons of a draft. Each carbon was an opportunity for revision, some
bearing signs of six or seven reworkings with different colored inks
and pencils. Colored pencils had another role: Moore often marked her
'a,' 'b,' and other rhymes with different colors to facilitate proper
repetition of the pattern throughout a poem."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Even at its
unruliest during the period just after the war, Moore's verse was always
carefully pieced together from a variety of sources.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's democratic combining of all types of textual materials, both
literary and popular, is a practice with intricate historical roots,
particularly in view of the poet's countervailing claim to "the eagle's
perch" of artistic selectiveness. But it was this mixture of the
common with the highbrow that distinguished Moore among her modernist
peers. Early detractors like the poet-critic Pearl Anderson, who branded
Moore's poems "hybrids of a flagrantly prose origin," objected to the
classical prose locutions that filled out her stanzas; but critics
were equally disturbed by her quirky variety of diction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

Colleagues like T. S. Eliot, on the other hand, admired Moore for her
"impeccable" rendering of "clenches and

<B></B>

clevelandisms" into an
"aristocratic" "American language" that merged "the jar-gon of the
laboratory and the slang of the comic strip."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 For William
Carlos Williams, the metrical and syntactic dexterity with which
Moore combed seventeenth-century English prose rhythms toward modern
journalism's "promotional prose" was rendered vital with a "swiftness" of
"transit" through an "intensely, intentionally selective" manipulation
of materials.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Democratic but not indiscriminate, Moore's
red-pencil habit of picking and choosing from among "all these phenomena"
was from the beginning portrayed as a radical aesthetic re-conration
of the place and the practice of the modern American poet.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By referring to clustering chromosomes as a structuring principle for her
stanzas, Moore was not locating the origins of her modernist technique
and aesthetic in such sociohistoric issues as immigrant screening and
eugenics. But her reference to genetics does suggest that the poet's work
was shaped in something other than a purely personal and idiosyncratic
remoteness from her time. Moore's most important formal practices,
including her broadly inclusive diction and her overburdened syntax,
were rather the outcome of a self-conscious reflec-tion on the nature of
language and poetry, a reflection grounded in an ongoing engagement with
a network of contemporary debates about genetics, immigration policy, and
the nature of "American" language in her time. Moore's poems and essays,
and her reading notes from the late teens and early twenties especially,
evince not only a direct knowledge of and involvement with genetics and
eugenics, but a deliberate adaptation of the conceptual foundations of
these sciences to language and writing. In developing her own modernist
aesthetics, Moore was explicitly concerned with how the generational
transmission of life forms might address the transmission of meaning
in language.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's manner of elaborating formal practices from contemporary social
debates has broad critical significance insofar as it challenges basic
assumptions about modernism, not least among them the assumption that
modernist poetic practices turn on a dichotomy between radical contingency
and a reactionary insistence on stable linguistic reference. Moore's case
shows us that, although postmodern models may be useful in describing some
varieties of modernist contingency, the roots of this feature lie in the
anti-rationalist moments of philosophical pragmatism, an epistemologically
"evasive" philosophy based in part on paradigms drawn from evolution
and eugenics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Pragmatism resembles post-modernism in its
rejection of a firmly grounded presence behind words, but it diverges from
many postmodernist positions by asserting that contingency of meaning
can in fact produce the ethical certainty that funds both personal and
political commitment and action. Guided by pragmatist mentors William
James and John Dewey, Moore derived from modern genetics an aesthetic
based on semiotic contingency that enabled her uniquely to confront
the essentialist logic of modern eugenics, or the science of racial
engineering. In semiotic contingency, Moore found something other than a
deconstructionist's challenge to conventional structures of meaning and
power. Instead, contingency left Moore



with an understanding that
ethical positions were powerfully significant not when they were written
in stone, but when they were adopted as choices. The route from semiotic
contingency to ethical certainty in Moore's work is one that cuts across
the lines of the dichotomies most critics construct to chart modernism
and modernist writers. And Moore's own placement of modern genetics and
eugenics at the conceptual center of her ethical aesthetic of accident
challenges long held critical assumptions that modernist aesthetics, and
especially Moore's, were formed in isolation from public and political
considerations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contemporary critics who pay warm or cool homage to the aesthetic
directives of modern poets might themselves urge that we historicize
Moore's sampling of eclectic materials by viewing it as a typically modern
aestheticizing of such historical phenomena as the practice of immigrant
screening, wherein the massing of aliens at Ellis Island Station restages
for American poets the exotic rush of new European aesthetics into the
poem on the page, or the clamor of mass taste and opinion. But either of
these aesthetically-based historical approaches to Moore's writing would
serve mainly to color in existing critical assumptions regarding modern
American poetry. And both approaches would overlook the role that Moore's
study of biology played in shaping her writing. For Moore, readings
in natural history and hybridization supplied a unique perspective on
the issue of immigration, particularly as new steerage from eastern and
southern Europe raised debates over race and heredity during the teens
and early twenties. Moore's aesthetic of inclusive selection, and her
distinguishing technical features--her elaborate stanzas, complex nominal
compounds, abrupt lineation, and the strong tendency in her poems toward
punningly metonymic modes of reference--these formal and rhetorical
qualities can be usefully seen as a biologist-poet's response to the
nativist controversy over immigrant selection. Merging her studies of
evolution, genetics, and eugenics into a modernist aesthetic through the
conceptual lenses of philosophical pragmatism, Moore developed a writerly
practice that should distinguish her poetry from that of modernist peers,
particularly Pound and Williams.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr. Cofer went on to describe them, medical checks at Ellis Island
in 1912 were both a liberal cultivation of "the generic opalescence of
humanity in...our immigrants"
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 and an exercise in racial
selection. In an effort to streamline mass screenings, examiners
scanned aliens for those "racial characteristics" that might index
potential diseases (<I>MPI,</I> 37-38). According to the Marine Hospital
doctor, "proven" and "trustworthy" physicians knew that "dangerous
and loathsome diseases preponderate" in the citizens of particular
European countries. The "ability to recognize nationality immediately
upon the line" was pronounced "a necessary factor in this examination"
(<I>MPI,</I> 39, 38). With a premium placed on the spot detection of
ambiguous "Class A-I diseases"--"idiocy, imbecility, fee-ble-mindedness,
epilepsy, insanity and tuberculosis" (<I>MPI,</I> 32-33)--the screenings
mandated by 1907 law appear to have been driven by racial concerns.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Distinguishing among the "racial characteristics" even of various
European immigrants, Cofer invoked a modern conception of race that
divided Europeans into several distinct categories: long-headed Teutonics,
stocky round-headed Alpines from central and eastern Europe, and slender
Mediterraneans. Cofer's polygenist conception of European races was
rooted in essentializing taxonomies of multiple racial stocks such as
those set forth in 1899 by the American economist William Ripley in
<I>The Races of Europe.</I> Such popular racialist schemas as Ripley's
were attractive to Americans who wanted to distinguish between the
modern "new immigration" from eastern and southern Europe and the old
one from the British Isles, Germany, and Scandinavia.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 If
the Marine Hospital doctor was shading his talk on immigrant screening
with racialist assumptions, however, the medical screening procedures he
spoke of could only have been applauded by his colleagues as gestures at
racial selection. During the first two decades of the twentieth century,
steerage swelled to nearly one million newcomers per year. Physicians'
chalk marks were cosmetic in the face of such numbers. With immigrant
families accounting for up to 80 percent of the populations of America's
largest cities, demographers began to speculate that the declining birth
rates of old-stock Americans could be attributed to growing fears of
future economic competition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newly discovered genetic principles--like the law of hybrid
reversion--were hastily adapted to polygenist notions of race, feeding a
growing nativist fear of American "race suicide" in the early twentieth
century. Popular studies like Madison Grant's <I>The Passing of the
Great Race</I> of 1916 charged that the new immigration was weakening
the nation's gene pool in a biological analog to America's democratic
transfer of power from old-stock "Nordic" Americans to inferior European
races.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Tabulations from immigrant intelligence tests and
from two million Alpha and Beta tests administered to Army recruits
would soon confirm a widespread tendency toward feeblemindedness in
the swarthier European races (<I>SL,</I> 156).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 President
Coolidge added fuel to the racist restrictionist campaign in 1921,
writing in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> of the proven degenerative effects
of mongrelization on America's Nordic genetic legacy (<I>SL,</I>
318). Eco-nomic unrest, combined with postwar isolationism and the
statistical fruits of eugenists like the mental tester Robert Yerkes,
provided potent summons for more comprehensive port restrictions. In
1924, with the issue of racial engineering debated openly in Congress,
the National Origins Act was passed and signed into law by Coolidge,
implementing quotas that maintained a constant influx of Nordic stock
while cutting to less than one fifth the numbers previously flowing from
countries populated by Mediterranean and Alpine races (<I>TE,</I> 177-78;
<I>HA,</I> 155-57).
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the late teens and early twenties, amid controversy over quotas
and Bolshevism and labor agitation, the nativist literary critic Van
Wyck Brooks railed against the "weak and sickly" condition of the arts in
America, complaining that



commercialism and an attendant "immigration
from without the Republic" had wrecked efforts to build a cultural
"nest" for literary development.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Radical cultural critics
like Randolph Bourne were meanwhile cautioning against the puritanical
foundations of the "cultic" "superstition" of "eugenics" and "racial
perfection."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 John Dewey's writings on immigrant culture
as a source for American art suggest that early modern calls for the
renewal of language through "a freshly evolved localized personality in
modern poetics" may have been sounded as a reaction against the popular
"middle class" nativism that pushed Ku Klux Klan membership to peaks
of two and a half million after World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 But however
American writers and intellectuals of the teens and twenties positioned
themselves with respect to issues of nativity and immigration and
race, the National Origins Act leads us to some important extraliterary
sources for the distinctive verse that Moore and her colleagues wrote
during this period. The work of geneticists and eugenists caught Moore's
attention and shaped her understanding of how meaning is transmitted
in poetry. Poets like Williams championed a localized idiom through an
aesthetic of contact with indigenous cultural and racial material that,
"rich / in savagery," could maintain a "primal and continuous identity
with the ground itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Under the pressure of immigration
and eugenics, Moore developed a less romantic nativist aesthetic by
adapting modern theories of heredity to semantic transmission. Genetics
grounded her belief that America's material and racial foundations were
in fact hard to locate. Indigenous essences could not be fixed in words
or poems themselves; instead they flashed like meaning through language,
trailing "zigzag inscriptions" (<I>MM,</I> 35) across series of word
accidents and biological puns. The new discipline of experimental biology
showed Moore that the very contingency that determines the generational
transmission of life forms might serve as an enriching and constitutive
force in language itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Granted an immediate political significance by the issue of immigration,
early modern models of genetic transmission might be considered as sources
for the branching metonymic associations that critics have noticed in
Moore's poetry and prose both (<I>LL,</I> 206, 233).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 In
his 1956 study of "The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles" of language,
Roman Jakobson drew on aphasia research in formulating a distinction
between the substitutional semantic principles of romantic poetry and
the contiguous ones of realist prose. The Russian formalist recounts
"a well-known psychological test" in which children linked words of
their own choosing to the key word <I>hut.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 These
children exhibited predilections toward words that were either
semantically "substitutive" of, or "contiguous" to, the object in
question. Substitutive, or broadly metaphoric, reactions to <I>hut</I>
ranged from synonyms like <I>hovel</I> to antonyms like <I>palace</I>
to metaphors like <I>den</I> and <I>burrow;</I> while contiguous, or
metonymic, responses included <I>thatch litter</I> and <I>poverty</I>
(<I>FL,</I> 91). Situating Jakobson's antinomy within the framework of
a larger discussion of semantic transmission, Paul de Man elaborated the
formalist's "substitutions" and "contiguities" as metaphoric "necessities"
and metonymic "contingencies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 For many critics, De Man's
writings on metaphor and metonymy

<B></B>

 are more eccentric than definitive;
and his elaboration of Jakobson's terms should not be seen to mark a
progressive aesthetic continuum against which Moore can be graded as
a precociously poststructuralist modernist poet. But "contingency"
is nevertheless an apt term for the accidental procedure of Moore's
associative writing. Moore's 1919 poem "In the Days of Prismatic Color,"
for example, is motivated by contingent semantic relations.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Metonymy unfolds this deeply creased statement about the seductiveness
of poetry. In the first of the passage's three segments, the floating
"principle," "throat," finds its synecdochal body as the instrument of
the smooth-voiced sophisticate. <I>Throat</I> and <I>sophisticate</I>
stand in a contiguous part-for-whole relationship much as do Jakobson's
<I>thatch</I> and <I>hut.</I> Through a metaphor of physical structure,
this throated sophisticate then becomes a serpent uncoiling from inside
its lair. Yet again, a set of synecdochal substitutions--"short legs" and
"feet" for a centipede--trigger the insect that gurgles from the snake's
skin. Lacking a central stated metaphor that links the arthropod to the
slinky medium containing it, few of the terms in this semantic chain
stand in necessary mutual relation. But the whole passage flows as an
account of how language deceives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">De Man contends that the terms of the part-for-whole and whole-for-part
substitutions of synecdoche are organically fused, rendering them
"borderline" tropes that convey essences as well as contiguous
relations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Every throat, by this reasoning, is honeyed
with the sophisticate's oil. But if contiguous synecdochal relations
convey shades of necessity, Moore qualifies the necessity of this poem's
terms by predicating their synecdoche on puns. All of the tropes in
this passage--whether metonymic, like the sophisticate's throat, or
metaphoric, like the throat's serpent--turn on the short legs of the
centipede that springs from the snake. The bug's multitudinous feet are
themselves contiguous to the sophisticate-snake's shadowy abode, which is
fixed at the footless "antipodes" of great truths. Only through the most
flagrant linguistic coincidences--through the pairing of "antipodes" with
"centipedes"--do this poem's metrical feet flutter the shadows of verse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the accidents and contingencies that determine the particulate
shuffle of biological heredity providing a conceptual ground for Moore's
metonymic and punning verse structures, discussions of language and life
forms and native <B></B> 
identity



 in poems like "England"  point toward
local political sources for Moore's writerly aesthetic. In Moore's poems
of the late teens and early twenties, issues of essence and accident
in linguistic and biological forms are fundamental to questions of both
semantic and genetic transmission.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this poem about American landscape and language, meaning, like
poison in look-alike plants, doesn't cling to the literal form of a
word. Common sense and a knowledge of mushrooms should tell us that
messages, though conventionally determined, are inflected by semantic and
social occasions. Calling in a 1920 <I>Dial</I> essay for an awakening
of the arts in America, the pragmatist John Dewey championed democratic
localism over empty nativist standards that demanded that immigrants
"be either Americanized or...go back where they came from." Dewey looked
to immigrant quarters for a renewal of the American tongue, claiming that
semantic vitality was not dissolved, but rather hardened and faceted, in a
melting pot where citizens are "too busy making the American language to
devote much time to studying the English."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The poet Moore
did not carry a localist imperative to the lengths of Williams's new
idiom of "the speech of Polish mothers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 But hidden among
the toadstools and mushrooms of "England" is a complaint against the
essentializing "Americanism" of racist restrictionists. The poison-fearing
enemies of dialect in Moore's poem speak pointedly to American advocates
of new standards of language and breeding. By posing a nominalistic spirit
of occasional identity against floating linguistic and biological forms,
"England" challenges the essentialism that underlies nativist visions
of a distinctive American race.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore held long to a vision of language and life forms as keys to a
fluxional native identity. Her reading diaries from 1907 onward track
the studies in biology and natural history that served to counterpoint
her readings in philosophy, aesthetics, and the arts. In notes from
her readings of 1919, shortly before "England"

<B></B>

 first appeared in
<I>The Dial,</I> Moore copied passages from an 1889 edition of Darwin's
<I>Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication.</I> Darwin's
featuring of New World plant and animal forms--of the "tiger-like"
markings of "dark-brindled" caterpillars, of "candlestick-like opuntias"
and "dirty door-mat" fleeced goats--resemble the metaphors and compounds
soon to crowd the poet's lexicon, suggesting Moore's stylistic debt to
this admirably businesslike Victorian expositor of phenomena.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

Of special interest to Moore as she read <I>Variation</I> were accounts
of New World floral and faunal nativity.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's further attention to Darwin's comparisons of New World dogs,
cats, and boars with their counterparts in England and Europe suggests
that questions of native identity and biological form were linked for
the poet throughout her reading of <I>Variation.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among Darwin's writings, <I>Variation</I>'s broad canvas of domesticated
plant and animal forms offers indefinite answers to the question of
racial essences. While the monogenist implications of evolutionary theory
provides a logical counter to early modern notions of distinct racial
types, the Darwin of <I>Variation</I> searched among domesticated life
forms for evidence of the direct genetic inscription and transmission of
environmentally derived traits. The dirty door-mat fleece on the goat
backs that Moore culled from Darwin was a feature browned "directly"
into generations from parental exposure to the Antigua sun (1250/2;
<I>VAP,</I> 103). Such neo-Lamarckian notions of the inheritance of
acquired characteristics offered American polygenists like Ripley and
Grant a topographical ground for modern racial essences. People pressed
together in homogenizing cities could be sorted on the basis of the
genetically cast stamps of their ancestral environments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While Moore did not look to the Lamarckian Darwin as a source
for polygenist conceptions of race, she noted something akin to a
hereditarian aesthetic foundation in Darwin's rendering of accounts such
as "Mr. Blyth's" on the origins of goldfish in China.

Moore's attention to Blyth's account suggests
that, for her, aesthetic essences like purity of color were linked
to the practice of selective breeding. Aesthetically remote from the
occasional shadings of partisanship, the poet's own writerly practice
might have been metaphorically conceived as a breeding of language
toward painterly truths. But if there are racialist overtones to the
breeding of decorative goldfish toward stable aesthetic essences, the
example of the MacKenzie River dogs in Darwin's <I>Variation</I> can
be said to supply Moore with sporting evidence of the hollowness of
racial essentialism. Dewey's nominalistic scolding in <I>The Dial</I>
of essentializing nativists who hold immigrants to an "Americanizing"
standard of proper English can be teased from Darwin's account of that
North American dog species which, "when brot. to Eng., never learned
to bark properly." Anglicization was happily marked for one river pup
"born in the Zoolog. Garden" who soon learned to make "his voice sound
as loudly as any other...of the same age and size" (1250/2).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's attention to the story of the MacKenzie River dogs marks her
playful awareness that culturally bound traits, such as habits of
"dialect," are not as easily graded as the redness of fish scales. The
continuum of variation that Darwin charts in his study, along with the
zigzag genetic contingency of hybrid production, helps to unravel the
ill-conceived terms of fixed formal essences. Comparisons of New World
with European dog species remind us that, lacking the gold standard of
red fish from China, our own cultural norms are fluid, ever shaped and
reshaped by accidents of transmission and by the changing complexions
of locales. American nativists are an offshoot of the stiff-lipped
imperialists who believe that their subjects should bark like the
Queen. When filtered through Moore reading Dewey and Darwin, "England'"s
rendering of "pure English" shows that nativist versions of American
racial identity are lacking in culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Moore gathered evidence against linguistic and biological and nativist
essences from readings of Dewey and Darwin, her modern understanding of
the instability of generational transmission provided a distinguishing
model for the kinky semantic chains that the poet fashioned especially
during the teens and twenties. The metonymic unfolding of "England"'s
lesson on resemblance and identity is finally more descriptive of Moore's
adaptation of genetics to poetry than the lesson itself. "England" is
prismatically a poem about America, with its musings on the nature of
wild and tame forms splintered from an overall account of nation and
nativity. Toadstools and a New England accent and temperament follow
from an evaporating catalogue of American character and tone.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cats and dogs; psalms, calm, and candles; mushrooms and poisonous
toadstools; heat, haste, mettlesomeness, and appetite. All these phenomena
materialize here not as the conceptual components of an overarching
metaphor of identity and resemblance, but as surveyed and surveying
features of a national character and landscape. Meaning proceeds by
fundamental leaps and skips in Moore's poetry; and these are leaps
both of contiguous surveillance, and of accidents of language. The same
punning directive that pushes contiguity to contingency in the metered
centipede of "In the Days of Prismatic Color" conditions the metonymic
logic of "England." Does it follow from the 'a' in candle that, because
there are poisonous toadstools, mushrooms are dangerous? Yes, but only
because scaled against "continents of misapprehension," toads perched
on stools describe an attitude of purists who watch over "calm." The
literal frog in Moore's mushroom is yet another false poison, but it is
one that affects a fortuitous identity in "England."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William Carlos Williams might have been speaking of the frog-pedants of
"England," or of the "humbug"-"hummingbug" of "Picking and Choosing," when
he described the "unbridled leaps," the semantic collisions that result
in Moore's verse from "a multiplication of impulses" "crossing at all
eccentric angles" ("MM," 59, 53). Modern visual art forms like collage
set edges and fragments into arrangements that sharpened particular
qualities by foregrounding distinctness rather than blending parts into
a whole (<I>FL,</I> 92). A similar crispness resulting from Moore's
"lack of connectives" led Williams to describe her work as a procedure
geared to restore a natural freshness to fragments of language. Moore's
poetry was predicated on a radical removal of word pieces--"cutting them
clean out"--from their disease-ridden sources. Removed "bodily" from the
"greasy contexts" of sense and sentimental attachments, old words were
then "treated with acid to remove the smudges" and reassembled into
structures that invigorated them as resonating terminals of artistic
intelligence (<I>CCE,</I> 57-58). It was in the "porcelain garden," the
"primitive masonry" ("MM," 58) of Moore's apple-edged ("MM," 55, 59)
"unstandardized" "units" that new meaning moved "easily and completely,"
enabling "the thought" to reveal "the 'thing'" otherwise masked by the
stale fragrance of reason ("MM," 58). In his 1925 appraisal of Moore,
the imagist Williams implied that words were somehow innately vibrant
and meaningful, but that they lost their discrete vitality within the
rationalist thought systems that support the enervating principles of
humanism. Poems performed a service to words by wrenching them from
common conventional sense. A textual

<B></B>

collage practice like Moore's
worked both to restore the intrinsic vitality of words and to juice them
with life by placing them within the artist's intuitive new circuitry
of relations ("MM," 52-54, 58). The freshness of Moore's language was
both natural, or necessary, and accidentally, or contingently, wrought.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While philosophical pragmatism, with its burrowing into "the particulars
of experience,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 was a likely support for the imagistic
standard of "things" Williams brought to Moore's "insoluble" writings
(<I>LL,</I> 161; "MM," 58), it was for Moore herself a conceptual
conduit channeling Darwin's theories of evolution and even Mendelian
genetic theory into the aesthetic of semantic collision at work
in her writings. Charles Molesworth reads Dewey as a source for the
poet's broadly modern concern with "the dialectic between tradition and
innovation, between the stable form and the individual act" (<I>LL,</I>
161). But pragmatism also supplied Moore with a conceptual route
between Darwinian notions of species and fluid Emersonian appraisals
of language, as well as a foundation for her aesthetic elaboration
of genetic contingency. Moore shared something of Williams's imagist
aesthetic of presence in poetry, and she may have drawn this as well from
nominalistic and "structuralist" relational moments in the philosophies of
Dewey and James. But the more rigorous attention to semantic contingency
that distinguishes Moore from her peers can finally be traced to the
pragmatists' philosophical and semiotic adaptation of the lessons of
natural history and genetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's favorite teacher at Bryn Mawr was Theodore de Laguna, a philosophy
and government professor who wrote on the impact of evolutionary theory
on pragmatism (<I>LL,</I> 41, 54).
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Shortly after graduating,
around 1910, Moore made a note of de Laguna's new book <I>Dogmatism and
Evolution</I> in her reading diary;
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 and then seven years
later she made careful study of the pragmatist Dewey--as if in prelude
to her 1919 reading of Darwin's <I>Variation.</I> Pragmatist tenets
themselves bear directly on the relations between Moore's aesthetic
and those of Williams and Pound. Passages from Dewey's <I>Essays
in Experimental Logic</I> and <I>Democracy and Education</I> that
Moore noted in her reading diary of 1917 express an imagist poet's
contempt for literalists who assume "that wherever there is a name,
there is some reality corresponding to it" (1250/2). Moore saw that the
Dewey of <I>Essays</I> blamed reason for the pettiness and pedantry of
literalists. Engulfed in abstract thought systems, those who trafficked
excessively in theories reduced "truth," or the "correspondence of idea
and fact," to a "static, inert relation," wanting a pragmatist's attention
to the "lead[ing]" and "guid[ing]" function of thought (1250/2). The
colorful dig at Bertrand Russell that Moore had earlier copied from an
issue of <I>The Nation</I> echoes a pragmatist emphasis on the mechanics
of contingency that momentarily joins, but finally distinguishes the
biologist-poet from her avant-garde American peers: "I should say that the
symbolic reals are about as truly representative of life and experience
as a bishop whose activities were confined to diagonal squares would be
representative of the archbishop of Canterbury...." (1250/1). For Moore,
the verbal sorcery that swaps the archbishop for a chess piece is an
illuminating lesson itself, one that beams

<B></B>

on Dewey's nominalist
caution: "the barest glance at human history shows that mistakes have
been the rule...." (1250/2).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Moore in 1917 found in the writings of Dewey philosophical support
for the imagist aesthetic of presence that she tentatively shared with
modernists like Pound and Williams, it may have been because she could
situate Dewey's nominalism within the context of her earlier interest in
pragmatism and language. During her student years at Bryn Mawr, the young
poet read William James appreciatively, absorbing more or less directly
his Emersonian vision of a language not of substantives, but of fluxional
relations (<I>LL,</I> 50, 70).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In his well-known 1890
essay, "The Stream of Thought," James contrasted the syntactic parcels
of Western language with his vision of a unity between the "substantive"
and "transitive" aspects of fluxional thought.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Asserting
that the "transition between the thought of one object and the thought
of another is no more a break in the <I>thought</I> than a joint in a
bamboo is a break in the wood," James reckoned that we "ought to say a
feeling of <I>and,</I> a feeling of <I>if,</I> a feeling of <I>but,</I>
and a feeling of <I>by,</I> quite as readily as we say a feeling of
<I>blue</I> or a feeling of <I>cold"</I> (<I>PP,</I> 240, 245-46).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In poems of the "National Origins" period of the late teens and
early twenties, Moore appears to have aesthetically realized James's
substantiation of the transitive tissue of speech through quotational
collages forcing a modernist compression of syntax. Compression of syntax
is a distinguishing characteristic of much American poetry written during
the period after World War I, and its debt to avant-garde visual and
conceptual arts has been discussed at some length.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Partly
from a wish to obscure, and partly in an effort to foreground what
James called the "shadings" of conceptual conjunctions, poets like Mina
Loy wrote dense poems that eliminated the pragmatist's <I>and, if, but,
by,</I> so that reading her work was, in one poet's words, "like walking
through granite instead of air."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In her free-verse collage
poems of the early twenties, however, Moore restores transitive shadings
to language through more complicated varieties of compression that extract
not just the connective tissue of speech, but such integral indexes to
meaning as subjects and verbs. Amid the breakdowns of syntax that attend
the densest of Moore's documentary collages (in poems like "An Octopus"
and "Novices"), dislocated phrases--many of them wrapped in quotation
marks --themselves emerge as the Jamesian linguistic "substantives,"
assuming the semantic burden of key syntactic referents. The quotational
object-poems that Moore composes in this manner are deceptive. Retaining
many of James's <I>and</I>s, <I>if</I>s, <I>but</I>s, and <I>by</I>s, they
have the tendrilly appearance of syntactically overfed prose. But they are
as conceptually austere as many imagist verses. Set in forbidding

<B></B>

juxtaposition, Moore's "substantive" quotational phrase-objects are
rendered "transitive" not by syntax but by the raw performance of
metonymic and metaphorical transactions among them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stamps of natural selection and modern genetics that distinguish
Moore's collage practice and her nativist aesthetic from the work of
her peers can be partly deciphered through James's and Dewey's appeals
to Darwin and to his modern genetic predecessors. In <I>Dogmatism and
Evolution,</I> Moore's teacher de Laguna wrote explicitly of the impact of
Darwin on pragmatist philosophers Peirce, James, and Dewey;
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

and as a student of biology, the young "Individualist" Moore must
have been particularly intrigued by James's Darwinian polemic against
Spencerian environmental determinism in her reading of <I>The Will
To Believe</I> (<I>LL,</I> 50, 70). James saw natural selection as a
powerful antidote to an enervating belief in a continuous identity between
individuals and societies and their environmental situations. Darwin's
significance to zoology and sociology alike lay for the philosopher
in the Victorian evolutionist's distinction between the causes that
produce variation and the causes that maintain it in the process of
selection.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Environment played a small role in selection,
but the greater generative production of variables, a bounty based on
"internal molecular accidents," was itself an unknown (<I>WB,</I> 223).

You know about the invisible factors of fermentation, and how the

lactic acid ferment or the alcoholic is introduced first, and gets
ahead of the                    other in starting the process. Now,
when the result is the tendency of an ovum,                     itself
invisible to the naked eye, to tip towards this direction or that in

in a region                 so recondite and minute, must be such a

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James's freefalling ovum is an antiquarian oddity, but his account
of biological reproduction as determined by an infinitesimal ferment
of a ferment anticipates the variable shuffling and reshuffling of
modern genetic combination. In his 1906-1907 lectures on pragmatism,
the philosopher went on to blend language study with life sciences in
appraising the evolutionary findings of "geologists, biologists and
philologists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Here James argued that natural history,
and studies of natural selection especially, had engendered wide
philosophical and linguistic repercussions. By showing us "the power of
chance happenings to bring forth fit results," "darwinism has once and for
all displaced design from the minds of the 'scientific,'" recommending to
the "contemporary imagination" "some kind of an immanent or pantheistic
deity working <I>in</I> things rather than above them" (<I>P,</I> 111,
70). Lecturing just as cytologists were beginning to demystify Darwin's
account

of natural selection, James tagged pragmatism itself "a
genetic theory of what is meant by truth" (<I>P,</I> 65-66).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dewey's account of Darwin's intellectual legacy was specifically concerned
with life forms and the rationalist underpinnings of teleology. In
a 1909 <I>Popular Science</I> essay entitled "Darwin's Influence upon
Philosophy," Dewey historicized the significance of biology to philosophy
and ethics. For Dewey, nature itself, with its tendency to generate like
forms "distant in space and remote in time," implanted and cultivated
notions of "type" in the minds of the Greeks and the scholastics: "the
conception of <I>eidos,</I> species, the fixed form and final cause, was
the central principle of knowledge as well as of nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

Perceptions of orderly biological design supported an Aristotelian
faith in intelligent systems of classification; and modern thought,
Dewey cautioned, still glints with a garden variety of reason.

freed the new logic for application to mind and morals by conquering the
phenomena of life. When he said of species what Galileo had said of the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James's and Dewey's grafting of "genetic theory" and "experimental
ideas" onto pragmatism, in 1906 and 1909 respectively, is noteworthy
considering that the term genetics had not been adapted to modern usage
until the biologist William Bateson garnered it for the new science in
1906.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Dewey's allusion to "genetic and experimental ideas"
suggests that natural selection for him, as for James, was

<B></B>

filtered
through the fresh discipline of "experimental biology" sweeping Europe
and America just after the turn of the century (<I>TE,</I> 15-25).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Moore's understanding of both the fluidity and contingency of plant
and animal species, and hence the fluidity and contingency of racial
identity, was philosophically and linguistically mediated by her readings
of James and Dewey, her knowledge of the genetic principles that support
these qualities was largely post-Darwinian. Moore's reading diary of
1919 ignores many of the bizarre Darwinian accounts of the transmission
of acquired mutilations--ranging from cracked cow horns to circumcised
foreskins--that James glossed over in <I>The Will To Believe</I> (Darwin,
<I>VAP,</I> 466-70; James, <I>WB,</I> 222). But lecture notes from biology
courses at Bryn Mawr indicate the poet's familiarity with "pangenesis"
and "gemules," baroque components of the somatic "blending" theory of
heredity that Darwin elaborated from antiquity in <I>Variation of Animals
and Plants under Domestication.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Eight years after the
1859 publication of <I>The Origin of Species,</I> Darwin was challenged
by colleagues to explain how single mutations might survive the swamping
that awaited their mixture with the mass of population.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

At this time, Gregor Mendel's statistical study of hybrid inheritance,
though published in 1865, was still awaiting wide readership. A Moravian
monk isolated from Europe's scientific circles, Mendel spent two
years crossing and recrossing the offspring of twenty-two varieties of
garden peas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Tracking the disappearance and reemergence of
isolated traits--greenness, yellowness, wrinkles, roundness--he concluded
that physiological characteristics were not actually fused in sexual
reproduction, but that they were in fact  particulate, preserved intact
and passed on as discrete entities, in dominant or recessive forms,
to subsequent generations. Because Darwin lacked such a handy defense
as Mendel's against the swamping challenge to natural selection, he
reverted to a Lamarckian notion of the inheritance of acquired traits:
environment, he would argue in <I>Variation,</I> played a direct and
persistent role in producing variations in species.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The neo-Lamarckian view that life forms were categorically determined
by ancestral environments was used to support American polygenist
conceptions of race like Coolidge's in his Nordic miscegenation tract in
<I>Good Housekeeping.</I> Conservative social planners struggled against
the conceptual challenges of those Darwinian notions of variational
contingency that James and Dewey located in <I>The Origin of Species,</I>
and sought instead to preserve the socially stratifying imperatives
of environmental determinism. Disparities of wealth and station were
justified by the idea that natural stresses strengthened a people's
genetic fiber, weeding out failures and programming successes directly
into future generations. And for Americans like Coolidge and Madison
Grant, the polygenist implications of environmental origins provided
modern racial fodder for the red tooth of "fitness." If the inheritance
of acquired characteristics fostered social visions that were narrowly
programmatic in the eyes of "individualists" like William James in
<I>The Will to Believe,</I> contrary hypotheses like August Weismann's
1890 theory of the germ plasm as an inviolate reproductive material
threatened

<B></B>

even colder extremes of biological determinism. The
notion that acquired characteristics might be more or less directly
inherited had at least supplied Americans of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries with a theoretical basis for melting-pot visions
of race-in-formation. In the image of the melting pot, Lamarckianism
provided a progressive outlook on what was seen as a necessarily mixed
racial American heritage and future: immigrants of various shapes
and shades could be both socially and biologically "Americanized,"
with their material adaptation to the New World leading more or less
directly to their genetic assimilation into a single "American race"
(<I>REC,</I> 245).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the turn of the century, American eugenists emerged to adapt current
biological and sociological imperatives, as well as the principles
of engineering, to this new race-in-formation. Lacking the mediating
term Franz Boas would gradually formulate as "culture," Lamarckian
eugenists "tended to assume the physical inheritance of...complex
mental characteristics" (<I>REC,</I> 251). Habit was embedded and
passed forth as instinct (<I>REC,</I> 247). Culture was conveyed
in the blood (<I>REC,</I> 253). Yet Weismann's theories of the germ
plasm, and the rediscovery in 1900 of Mendel's study of hybrid garden
peas, did not precipitate an immediate dismissal of Lamarckianism in
American biological sciences. Rather, in the first two decades of the
century, biology was caught between extremes of holdover Lamarckian
environmentalism and the early biological determinism of geneticists
who had yet to map what Hamilton Cravens calls the "contingent" effects
of populations and surrounding environmental factors on the process of
genetic combination (<I>REC,</I> 253-54; <I>TE,</I> 171). Not only did
hereditarian biologists lack the mediating findings of later population
geneticists from within their own discipline, they were also resistant,
in a growing climate of nativism, to the more sophisticated models of
biological and cultural identity that eventually emerged in the twenties
and thirties in the form of Boasian cultural anthropology (<I>REC,</I>
299-302). The eugenics movement, which flourished in leading universities
during the teens and twenties, sprang from what we recognize now as an
improbable hybridization of Lamarckian social thought and hereditarian
biological tendencies. But in the pre-Boasian climate of the times, its
innate contradictions were not so immediately apparent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of particulate inheritance held special appeal to early modern
scientists who wished to merge biological with social sciences under the
technical aegis of engineering. Charles Davenport was sanguine regarding
the utilitarian implications of a particulate genetic constitution when
he addressed members of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science in 1904.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the turn of the century, Davenport campaigned to bring to
America the statistical approach to nature study developed by British
biometricians like Karl Pearson and Sir Frances Galton, Charles Darwin's
cousin. Appointed secretary to the Committee on Eugenics of the American
Breeder's Association, Davenport encouraged the activities of its members
such as popular luminaries like Alexander Graham Bell and Luther Burbank,
as well as leading biologists, sociologists, and psychologists--including
the mental tester Yerkes--known for their pioneering work in mental
inheritance, feeblemindedness, and criminology (<I>HA,</I> 62, 64-65).
Among the committees that Davenport oversaw was one on immigration
headed by Prescott Hall and Robert DeC. Ward, leaders of the elite and
influential Boston-based Immigration Restriction League. Fellow Brahmins,
and former Harvard mates of the pedigreed puritan Davenport, Hall and
Ward posed the issue of immigration in starkly polygenist terms. They
drew from Ripley and from the New York society lawyer Madison Grant in
adapting to racial engineering distorted "Mendelian" principles such as
the notion that crossbreeding inevitably leads downward toward reversions
to more "primitive" ancestral types (<I>REC,</I> 68, 324n). At immigrant
stations like Ellis Island, Ward and Hall argued, Americans must choose

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's own writings in fact show that she managed a deliberate
application of the new science to her poet's aesthetics, and it is
through a close study of particular notes, essays, and poems that we
can more precisely appreciate her understanding and use of eugenics. In
poems like 1921's "The Labors of Hercules," for example, Moore spoke out
directly against such patrician proponents of Nordic supremacy as Hall,
Ward, and Madison Grant, likening the barrenness of elite restrictionists
to the emptiness of the truisms that they exploited. It is an effort,
Moore begins, "To popularize the mule," teaching it the democratic

mares. Engendered at the limits of hybridity, these mixed creatures were

vigorous and powerful as they were sterile. If such an emblem as
the mule in "Hercules" interrogates equally the purity and the fertility
of "the high priests of caste," it embodies a flaw in the character
of nativist appeals to Nordic supremacy. When read in the context of
restrictionist debates about race, the excerpted sermon that closes the
poem does more than dismiss empty rhetoric and bigotry on principle: it
challenges eugenists like Grant, Hall, and Ward by closing with a World
War I-era nationalist's slur against German-Americans, "hyphenated"
citizens of divided loyalty who had fallen from favor as the first-born
tribesmen of the great Nordic race (<I>SL,</I> 197-98). Sowing their

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Written shortly before Burbank's death in 1926, Moore's paean to
the Wizard of Santa Rosa crowns a popularity that ranged widely among
modernist writers, from Pound in his essay on "Cavalcanti," to T. S. Eliot
in "Burbank with a Baedeker," to Dos Passos in <I>U.S.A.</I> As the
pragmatist-naturalist poet who admired the businesslike prose of Charles
Darwin, while admiring practical Henry Ford for his "unbusinesslike"
"fondness of nature" (1250/1), Moore seems almost to have made an
aesthetic study of the vegetable inventions of the celebrated modern
breeder. Burbank's crossing of peaches with almonds, of

<B></B>

apples with
quinces, of potatoes with tomatoes (<I>GTG,</I> 102)--and his christening
of hybrids like "Elephant Garlic," "The Paradox Walnut," "The Pearl
Prune," "The Blood Plum," and "The Sunberry"--might be considered as
sources for the proliferating compound nominal hybrids that distinguish
Moore's diction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Praised by fellow botanists as a hands-on
hybridizer with an unschooled but judicious eye (<I>GTG,</I> 118-20),
Burbank with his suncraft is a demystifying model for the collage writer
of lab notes and advertisements who affected to map her own handiwork
with quotations and notes. As a "designer" of nature, however, Burbank's
practice with plants resounds with topical eugenist premises, politically
flavoring his canonization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's praise of the colorful Burbank in 1925 as a great modern
"educator" appeals to the racist foundations of the National Origins Act
not only through the metaphorically volatile concept of horticultural
"design," but through the celebrated hybridizer's direct involvement
with the eugenics movement. A national hero during the early decades
of the century, Burbank was sought after by journalists for his views
on subjects ranging from diet and meditation to evolution and school
reform. The California gardener was an early advocate of Chinese immigrant
exclusion, and his only book-length publication was on the subject
of eugenics (<I>GTG,</I> 160, 156). Appearing initially in 1906 as a
long essay in <I>Century Magazine</I> (then edited by the young poet
William Rose Ben&eacute;t, a childhood neighbor and lifelong friend
of Moore's), <I>The Training of the Human Plant</I> won praise from
temperance advocates like the poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox, who proposed
that the government distribute a copy of Burbank's book to every mother
in the nation (<I>GTG,</I> 161). The tract began with a chapter on
"The Mingling of Races," which contained a demographic breakdown of the
752,864 immigrants who entered the U.S. in 1904. In the face of such a
"colossal example of the crossing of species," Burbank proposed to adapt
"the principles of plant culture and improvement in a more or less
modified form to the human being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 An admirer of Darwin's
<I>Variation in Animals and Plants under Domestication</I> (<I>GTG,</I>
33) Burbank was at this time an anomaly as a eugenist who believed that
"environment is the architect of heredity"; and his prescription for the
melting pot buried racist and classist anxieties beneath vague calls for
"supervision and selection" and a glowing emphasis on nurturance and
educational reform--namely fresh air and sunshine and no school for
children under ten.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore may or may not have had the hybridizer-educator Burbank in
mind when she wrote, late in life, of students as "foster plants
of scholarship" (<I>LL,</I> 32); but she was clearly tracking his
horticultural and sociological innovations in her reading diaries of the
early twenties. During the 1922 family trip to Mt. Rainer that led to
her long twin poems "Marriage" and "An Octopus," Moore copied passages
from an interview with Burbank from the July 16 <I>Seattle Times.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the scientific periodicals Moore skimmed during the National
Origins fervor was <I>The Journal of Heredity,</I> the leading forum for
American eugenists throughout the teens and twenties. Noting articles
on the "Inheritance of Mental Traits," "Twinning in Brahma Cattle," and
"The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln," the poet copied passages such as this
one on heredity and criminality from a 1924 article on "Behavior and
Gland Disease": "In disease as in health, the man of the gutter will
behave according to his world and the man of the peaks in keeping with
his."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Moore's interest in heredity and hereditarians may
have been as aesthetic and skeptical as sincerely scientific, but in
the context of praise for Burbank, it seems to signal at least a tacit
support for eugenics. If Moore partook of the sanguine spirit of racial
engineers like Davenport, indirectly celebrating new racialist steerage
restrictions with her praise of stoneless plums and sweet lemons,
however, she also anticipated flaws intrinsic to the science of human
selectivity that Burbank set forth. In the margin of her transcription
of the <I>Seattle Times</I> interview with Burbank, Moore queried
"(What about recessive traits [indecipherable mark] Elizabeth Tuttle
[indecipherable mark] Edward's grandmother)" (1250/3).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's cryptic dialogue with Burbank can be read in two ways. On the one
hand, eugenist judges had begun by 1925 to accept "Mendelian recessives"
as grounds for the mandatory sterilization of the promiscuous daughters of
feebleminded mothers--the same poor and uneducated women already being
sterilized by court order in twenty-five states (<I>HA,</I> 138-39,
133-37). Moore's quarrel might then be with the softness of the plant
breeder's program of selection. The hybridizer who had called in <I>The
Training of the Human Plant</I> for laws "to prohibit in every State in
the Union the marriage of the physically, mentally, and morally unfit"
(<I>HA,</I> 58) seemed now to be peddling an overly positive program, one
which accented "selection of the best" while evading the question of how
to weed out the worst. In the context of Moore's pragmatist leanings and
poetic practice, however, her own reference to recessive traits seems
to constitute a more fundamental criticism of Burbank the eugenist. By
using Mendelian terms to challenge the horticulturist's na&iuml;ve
hereditarian approach

<B></B>

 to social issues, the poet begins to align
herself with the more contemporary discoveries of population geneticists.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thomas Morgan and his Columbia University lab partners bred fruit flies in
milk bottles during the late teens and early twenties, establishing that
genetic transmission was a far more complex and contingent affair than
eugenists like Davenport--and the <I>Seattle Times'</I>s Burbank--had
conceived it to be (<I>TE,</I> 171). Mendelians had erred first by
assigning single corresponding genetic units to discreet somatic features:
one gene unit for eye color, one for hairline, another for width of
jaw. They assumed that biological reproduction involved a one-on-one
matching-up of gene units that resulted in various combinations of
dominant and recessive traits. Eugenists then elaborated from this
miscast framework a similar correspondence between genetic units and
particular character traits, such as laziness and wanderlust (<I>TE,</I>
164, 172: <I>HA,</I> 67-68).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 The second mistake of the
Mendelians--their hereditarian determinism--was related to the first. In
order that heredity might be arithmetically cast, the process of genetic
combination was abstracted from contaminating local environmental
contexts. Morgan's fruit fly populations showed that environmental
pressures did indeed play a role in the pairing of chromosomes (<I>TE,</I>
171-72). One of the fundamental contradictions of racist eugenicism was
its joining of a Lamarckian polygenist essentialism--which used geography
and climate as grounds for racial essences--with a neatly manipulable
hereditarian determinism (<I>SL,</I> 152-53; <I>REC,</I> 324n). In her
eugenical reference to recessive traits, Moore asks Burbank how trait
selection can engineer the many randomly hidden units of genes. Although
the question itself reflects a unit conception of genetic material that
was already under challenge by Morgan, the poet was implicitly suggesting
that the designing of Americans might be a chancier enterprise than the
designing of roadsters. Against deterministic selection, Moore invoked the
sort of Jamesian fermentation of environment and heredity that population
geneticists were recognizing as essential to biological reproduction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the National Origins Act lent a political immediacy to Moore's interest
in horticultural design and genetics, then the modern American science
of racial engineering might be indirectly traced to Moore's writerly
aesthetics. Bonnie Costello has noted that a number of Moore's poems
treat questions of aesthetic representation through the thematic lenses
of biological and artistic reproduc-tion. In Moore's "Nine Nectarines,"
for example, the genealogical impulses attendant to natural history and
art history provide, in their "infinite regress," a formal account of
Moore's own multiply-authored quotational poems.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Moore's
crossing of natural history with mythology and aesthetics in her 1935
poem about a Chinese porcelain painting, however, suggests the role of
genetics as a complicating factor in her distinctive modernist practice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore knew from readings of Darwin and the Swiss botanist Alphonse de
Candolle that the origins of the peach and the nectarine were a subject
of nineteenth-century contest. Among the more tantalizing clues to the
origins of hybridized, or specifically crossed, plants like Victorian
nectarines were accounts of sudden reversions to aboriginal forms
(<I>VAP,</I> 398, 439). Darwin's <I>Variation of Animals and Plants under
Domestication</I> cites many reports of nectarine trees springing from
peach parents, as well as abundant instances of "sports," or mutated
nectarine clusters on peach-tree limbs, and occasional "half-and-half"
fruits. But seed reversions and bud-variations pointed the other way
too, with cases of "nine peaches on a nectarine" providing evidence for
each tree as the specific parent of the other (<I>VAP,</I> 361). Through
centuries of back-and-forth crossing, the hybridization of nectarines
and peaches seemed so thorough that neither fruit could remember where
it began. If there was anything to be learned from genetics, it may have
been located in the humility of the meticulous de Candolle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mendelian recessives and Darwinian bud-variations are important components
of Moore's modernist aesthetic because they illustrate the fundamental
instability of life forms in transmission.  By naturalizing accidents in
generational carriage, the saltations of particulate inheritance enrich
the relational aesthetic of modern poetry in the same way that postmodern
semiotics give depth to the formalist distinction between substitutional
and contiguous tropes. Admired through the gates of Dewey's "garden of
life," the blushing contrast between nectarines and peaches grafts its
still-life contiguity onto the tree of knowledge itself. The nectarine
beside the peach becomes the nectarine behind the peach, displacing the
conceptual agency that determines the genesis and transmission of both
life and meaning. Within the framework of biological transmission,
"substitution" becomes generational "necessity," and positional
"contiguity" becomes a variety of transmissive "contingency." The very
particulate contingency of modern genetic combination that accounts
for such marvelous sports of hybrid reversion as Darwin recorded in
<I>Variation</I> is what enables Moore to transfer the laws of genetics
to both the particulate nominalist and relational aesthetics of modern
imagist and ideogrammatic poetry. Applied to poetry, genetic contingency
shakes the semiotic burden of natural generation not only from the
primitive index of things in words, but from the structuralist standard
of foundational relations upon which poems like the <I>Cantos</I> and
<I>Paterson</I> come to rest. Developing her own metonymically strung
semantic chains toward the contingency that conditions hybrid production,
Moore used an image of nine nectarines on a peach tree as a metaphor
for the generative displacement of meaning that distinguishes her poetry
for contemporary readers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the DNA molecule was finally "solved" in the fifties, its codings
revealed a relational complexity far greater than counts of garden peas
or even fruit flies had indexed (<I>HA,</I> xi). Scientifically-minded
Americans commonly recognized that, notwithstanding new ethical
imperatives, nature was so full of surprises, of tics on the order of
recessive traits and bud-variations, that eugenists were left finally as
helpless in their attempts to fix future races as were Victorian botanists
in their efforts to trace the origins of fruit. Early twentieth-century
population geneticists who mapped the contingency of chromosome pairing,
discovering that its chemical intricacy was then further tensed by
environmental pressures, had comprised a sort of modernist vanguard
in recognizing that, as a science, eugenics could offer at best a
succession of natural and unnatural accidents. "The facts in themselves
are curious," wrote Darwin, "concerning evidence on the origin of the
nectarine" (<I>VAP,</I> 361).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accidents were never anathema to Moore; and her praise for "prudent
de Candolle" should probably not be read as a retrospective swipe at
an American scientific movement that was beginning its retreat in the
thirties (<I>TE,</I> 180). The

<B></B>

examples of peaches and nectarines
in Moore's poem, however, show that it is not only the mechanics but
the premises of racial engineering that are flawed. As "Nine Nectarines"
ends with an image of a mythological creature eating one of the fruits
hanging from the branch in the porcelain, a complex correspondence
between biological and cultural transmission begins to emerge.

with the first Chinese written characters on its back.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

As a "small cinnamon-brown, common / camel-haired unicorn," Moore's
hornless pony is itself an ideogram composed of linguistic components
as fresh and impure as that of the "puce-American-Beauty pink" blush of
the nectarine, a derivative fruit that adapts to the "hardiness" of the
North American vernacular and climate alike (<I>VAP,</I> 360). Browned
into the Chinese unicorn, "cinnamon" and "camels" invoke the history of
the animal's hybridization, the ancient east-west trade routes along
which legends and fruit stocks moved, linking points from old Rome to
Ispahan to Pekin.

 Language, like peach stones, confuses
the East with the West and the Old World with the New. It serves as
a barrier to origins and as a cultural frame. We don't find essences
in the philological substance of words; but language roots us in its
half-moon arcs of inflection. Moore's Chinese are pragmatist sages. They
make stories, not studies, of origins.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Genetic variability provides the semiotic ground that distinguishes
Moore's modernist imagist aesthetic from that of her colleagues. If
a pragmatist resistance to syntactically braced systems of language
supports the semantic freshness that Moore achieves through compression,
hyphenation, and slip-disc lineation, this freshness is animated
by semantic renderings of principles like Mendel's recessives and
Darwin's aboriginal reversions. "Nectarine" holds the nectar that
feeds the animus of language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 This is not a painterly
pun native to the peach-eating kylin, but an accident of nature and
of translation which structures Moore's vision of language. In the
best of her writing, an aesthetic of accident and semantic collision
keeps her ever-awakening phrases away from the snares of truisms and

<B></B>

clich&eacute;s. Like the imagist poets of the early modern
period, Dewey recognized the power of the modern Ptolemaic tendency
toward universalization, and he grounded its political register in the
"Americanizing" imperative of racist restrictionists. Moore too saw the
local political stakes of the snake-charming lure of racist truisms, and
her poetics are perhaps all the more radically Copernican for her own
work's witness to such common flaws in herself. "It was a Chinese / who
imagined this masterpiece." Didacticisms like this one display Moore's
own susceptibility to untried essences, a common weakness that keeps us
watchful today of our own language and politics, despite the hovering
lessons of modern history. Paired with her admiration for eugenists like
Burbank, Moore's predilection for the very commonplaces against which
she wrote pushed her outside the realm of common aesthetics toward an
aesthetic of renewal. Life sciences provided a semiotically enriched
dadaist model for semantic transmission that was as yet uncommodified by
the discourse of aesthetics. Emerging ever so slowly, the laws of genetics
were rawer and yet more rigorously antirationalist than the Continental
aesthetics of F. T. Marinetti or Tristan Tzara. Fundamentally fluid
yet sharply particulate, and immediate yet complex in their pragmatic
admission of local environmental influence, genetics gave Moore a ground
that was more vividly indeterminate than the ethically procreative
economies of Pound or the wilderness wedding beds of William Carlos
Williams. Attuned to a pragmatist's insistence on the leading and guiding
function of accidents themselves, however, Moore was not merely the most
rigorous of the modernist harbingers of indeterminacy. More than her
modernist peers, and more than many of her postmodernist successors, she
found in semantic contingency a practical foundation for the declaration
of ethical truths.
