J. M. W. Turner once depicted a harbor seen against the light.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 He showed the drawing to a naval officer, who remarked that the ships
 had no portholes. "No, certainly not," Turner replied and told the naval
 officer that if he would look at the ships against the sunset, he would
 find he could not see the portholes. The naval officer retorted that
 the artist surely must have known they were there. "Yes," said Turner,
 "I know that well enough; but my business is to draw what I see, and not
 what I know is there." Where the painter's eye perceives sun-drenched
 vessels, the naval officer perceives armed warships. Aesthetic experience
 and practical reason do not inhabit the same world. To observe an object
 from a user's point of view, the anecdote implies, is to engage in a
 perceptual activity radically different from the point of view of a
 spectator who has no interest in the object perceived other than to,
 say, paint it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An influential champion of Turner's late manner, John Ruskin quoted
this anecdote in his treatise on the relations between art and the
natural sciences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 For him, the story epitomized an aesthetic program, whose ultimate
 task was to correct the detrimental effects of industrial society on
 human experience. Ruskin resented many things modern: railway travel,
 for example, fatigued the human sensorium; photography risked making
 the eye too fastidious; and viewing instruments such as the Claude
 glass perverted artistic seeing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The anecdote, which Marcel Proust related in the preface to his
translation of Ruskin's <I>The Bible of Amiens</I>, points to one of
many links between the British art critic and the French author.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 A sincere admirer of Ruskin's philosophy of art, Proust

<B></B>

made the spirit of the anecdote into his own. As Jean Autret has
emphasized, it provides a key to the artistic sensibility for which
<I>Remembrance of Things Past</I> becomes a vehicle and that the
portrait of the painter Elstir in particular serves to articulate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Fresh sense perception versus confining intellectual notions: this
 distinction is fundamental to Proust's visual aesthetics. Teaching the
 virtues of the cultivation of sensory experience, <I>Remembrance of
 Things Past</I> articulates a didactics of disinterested perception--of
 seeing for seeing's sake, of listening for the pleasure of sounds,
 and so on. The task of the artist is to be alert to the immediacy of
 sensory experience and, as Proust's narrator underscores in the Elstir
 episode, to restore it by inventing the appropriate metaphor.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Given Proust's reverence for Ruskin, and given his adoption of the
master's belief in the innocence and purity of the painterly eye, one
would expect the author of <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I> to reject
mechanical means of visual representation. After all, Proust's novel is
concerned, among many other things, with the discovery by the narrator of
an aesthetic program that rests upon the Ruskinian distinction between
numbing habit and unmediated sensory experience, between agreed-upon
intellectual notions and unbiased forms of comprehension. And true
enough, as the narrator warms to the didactic tasks he has set himself,
particularly in the last volume, <I>Time Regained</I>, he repeatedly
criticizes photography and cinematography, declaring them inferior to
the human eye, the art of writing, and last but not least, the workings
of memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Proust would not be Proust if it were that simple. There is a
tremendously complex and productive relationship between the ideal of
unmediated vision articulated by <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I> and
the author's deployment of photographic and cinematographic techniques
of representing visual experience. For not only does Proust appropriate
such modes of representation; he puts them to use at precisely those
moments where he attempts to elaborate what one may call a phenomenology
of perception, that is, when he seeks to render perceptual activities
that are uninhibited by intellectual preconceptions. Indeed, some of
Proust's boldest stylistic solutions owe their deepest impulses to
machines of vision. Cinematographic means of representation, I want to
argue, are singularly well suited to Proust's ambition to restore sensory
impressions that have not been domesticated by the dulling force of habit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nowhere does this become as clear as in the article "Impressions de route
en automobile." Written in the early fall of 1907 and published in <I>Le
ro</I> on 19 November, the article is based on the motoring trips
Proust had made that same summer with Alfred Agostinelli, the driver
he had hired for the purpose. Together they visited places in Normandy
that Ruskin had written about, such as Bayeux, Conches, Lisieux, and
Caen. Comfortably reclining in the passenger seat, Proust was able
to concentrate on the vistas passing by; the most thrilling ones made
their way into "Impressions de route en automobile." In fact, Proust
was so pleased with the centerpiece of the article--the description
of the church steeples rising above Caen--that he was to recycle it in
<I>Remembrance</I>, in the pages known as the Martinville episode. Widely
thought of as one of the most important and most enigmatic passages the
novel, the Martinville episode relates how the young narrator, sitting
next to the coachman on a horse-driven

<B></B>

carriage, comes to witness how the steeples of Martinville appear to
be dancing on the horizon. Significantly enough, the visual experience
propels the narrator's very first piece of writing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Jean-Yves Tadi&eacute; has suggested, the <I>ro</I> article was an
"embryo of the future work."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Yet "Impressions de route en automobile" merits our attention not
 just because it casts an interesting light on the genesis of Proust's
 novel. Read closely, it complicates the received view of the French
 author's relationship to Ruskin. Although Proust's <I>p&eacute;riode</I>
 <I>ruskinienne</I> is commonly believed to have ended in 1906, the
 motoring article shows that post-Ruskinian Proust was at once more
 Ruskinian and more modernistic than has previously been thought. For
 while the piece is strikingly Ruskinian in spirit, Proust paid tribute
 to his old mentor's aesthetic program in rather unexpected ways--by
 turning Ruskin's anti-modern stance on its head. How can this be? The
 answers will carry us far into Proust's universe. Ultimately, the 1907
 article provides us with a richer understanding of the aesthetics of
 perception that informs <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I>, which he
 began writing the following year.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An episode in the second volume, <I>Within A Budding Grove</I>, takes us
to the heart of the novel's visual aesthetics. The narrator is vacationing
in Balbec, a seaside resort on the Norman coast. One hot summer day he
pays a visit to the atelier of the famous painter Elstir. A fictitious
re, Elstir is a composite of an array of nineteenth-century painters,
first of all Turner, but also artists such as Monet, Whistler, Moreau, and
Vuillard; in addition, Elstir is designed to remind the reader of Ruskin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 No sooner has the narrator entered the studio than he is seized by
 happiness and the prospect of rising to a poetical understanding of
 reality. Elstir's atelier, he proclaims enthusiastically, is nothing
 less than a "laboratory of a sort of new creation of the world . . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The canvases lining the studio, most of them seascapes, makes him
 perceive the sea anew, and the beach and the sky and the foaming
 waves. The experience elicits a piece of art criticism, as spirited as
 it is ingenious: "[Elstir] had extracted, by painting them on various
 rectangles of canvas that were placed at all angles, here a sea-wave
 angrily crashing its lilac foam on to the sand, there a young man in
 white linen leaning on the rail of a ship. The young man's jacket and
 the splashing wave had acquired a new dignity from the fact that they
 continued to exist, even though they were deprived of those qualities in
 which they might be supposed to consist, the wave being no longer able
 to wet or the jacket to clothe anyone" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:892-3/2:190).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only has Elstir freed the wave and the jacket from their established
denotations; he has also restored the meanings that habitual perception
prevents the beholder from perceiving. This is to say that the wave and
the jacket, having slipped out of the grip of a reality which revolves
around usage and function, have managed to enter a world of purposeless
beauty. In this way, the narrator intimates that Elstir is not a realist,
much less a naturalist; if anything, the painter is an impressionist--he
is faithful to the visual impression and the immediate ways in which it
comes before him.

<B></B>

He transforms the visible world, at the same time restoring its lost
glory, with the effect that the beholder is taken back to the dawn of
creation: "if God the father had created things by naming them, it was by
taking away their names or giving them other names that Elstir created
them anew. The names which designate things correspond invariably to
an intellectual notion ["notion de l'intelligence"], alien to our true
impressions, and compelling us to eliminate from them everything that
is not in keeping with that notion" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:893/2:191).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The world of phenomena appears as though it had just been born,
for the conventional links between signifier and signified have been
severed. To this end, Elstir's prime means is the painterly equivalent
of the metaphor--the metamorphosis. This is why the narrator seizes on
those seascapes where the contours of land and sea blend and eventually
change places, where the town rising above the sea has been rendered in
"marine terms," and the sea has been depicted in "urban terms." To be
sure, the beholder will eventually recognize the sea and the town, but
through notions not typically associated with them. This is the sense
in which Elstir not only strips things of their common names but also,
and above all, endows them with new ones. And in naming things anew,
the artist invites the beholder to see them anew, richer, fuller, and
more dignified.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The episode also contains an enigmatic description of the studio
itself. The blinds are closed, the atelier plunged in half-light. But
there is one place, the narrator underscores, "where daylight laid
against the wall its brilliant but fleeting decoration, dark; one small
rectangular window alone was open" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:893/2:191). A darkened
chamber, with a small opening providing the only source of light: Elstir's
studio is literally and ratively represented as a camera obscura,
complete with an aperture. The dark room turns into a metaphor for the
artist's power to recreate the world as he pleases.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The painter's eye as camera obscura? The metaphor acquires a peculiar
resonance, as the episode also includes a lengthy reflection upon
the rivalry between painting and photography. The competition with
the mechanically produced image has forced Elstir to reinvent his
painterly aesthetics. This is because photography--"une industrie,"
Proust writes--has banalized traditional art. "Since Elstir began to
paint, we have grown familiar with what are called 'wonderful' [in
French, "admirable"] photographs of scenery and towns" (<I>RTP</I>,
1:896/2:194). The appeal of photography lies in its ability to explode
habitual ways of seeing by estranging seemingly familiar visual domains,
at the same time being a faithful recording of the motif in question:
"If we press for a definition of what admirers mean by the epithet [i.e.,
"admirable"], we shall find that it is generally applied to some unusual
image of a familiar object, an image different from those that we are
accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason
doubly striking because it surprises us, takes us out of our cocoon of
habit, and at the same time brings us back to ourselves by recalling to
us an earlier impression" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:896-7/2:194).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No matter how pleasing and revelatory photographic means of representation
may be, and no matter how effectively it ruptures habitual modes of
perception, it was

<B></B>

painting, not photography, that was first in the field. Historically
speaking, what characterized painting was its extraordinary ability
to defamiliarize the familiar and to make the beholder look at the
world anew, but the mechanically produced image has now appropriated
this very domain, with the effect that traditional painting appears
obsolete, even lacking in originality. So it is that the sheer existence
of photography forces the art of painting to reinvent itself. In other
words, in suggesting that the superior ability of photography to represent
landscape and urban sceneries has forced Elstir to abandon his classical
motifs, the narrator offers a historical explanation of the painter's
artistic choices. As Anne Henry has underscored, this is all the more
remarkable since Proust, throughout <I>Remembrance</I>, tends to deny
that history may serve as a valid point of departure for explication in
the realm of art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Yet here history is explicitly and insistently evoked--in order to
 explain how Elstir's classical motifs and mode of painting began to
 lose legitimacy and how, as a result, he tries to attain an innocent,
 unbiased, and non-theoretical mode of seeing. In short, he comes to
 celebrate the visual and visionary capacities of the disinterested
 spectator--just like Turner did in his late period and as Monet and other
 impressionists were to do later in the nineteenth century. Nathalie
 Sarraute has captured this sea change in an apt phrase: "since
 Impressionism, all pictures have been painted in the first person."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elstir thus gives priority to the visual impression, not the
intellect. This is why he always attempts to rid himself of all knowledge
(in French, "intelligence") before sitting down to paint. To know
a thing means that the thing ceases to exist in and of itself, the
narrator maintains, an idea that reveals not merely what one may call
a phenomenological strand in Proust's work but also an epistemological
stance, including the ideal of an inductive knowledge of the "essences" of
the world by way of pure perception. That Elstir seeks to remain faithful
to the purely visual aspects of the seen does not mean, however, that his
paintings are necessarily "true" in the ordinary sense of the word; he may
well depict an optical illusion and therefore commit an "error," as when
the sea emerges like a town. But the narrator conceives of such illusions
as <I>prior</I> to the work of the intellect and therefore artistically
true (<I>RTP</I>, 2:194/1:897). For all the immediacy of such optical
errors, however, the artist nonetheless has to <I>unlearn</I> his mode of
seeing in order to be able to see what he actually perceives; in fact,
he has to accustom his eyes ("habituer les yeux") to not recognizing,
for example, that fixed boundary which separates land from sea and so
tells the beholder to identify the town as a town and the waves as waves
(<I>RTP</I>, 2:192-3/1:895). In other words, Elstir's aesthetics
of perceptual innocence presupposes the education of the eye.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrator's encounter with Elstir is a key episode in
<I>Remembrance</I>. Like the portraits of the writer Bergotte, the
composer Vinteuil, and the actress Berma, the Elstir episode articulates
crucial aspects of the novel's artistic program. Proust alludes several
times to the studio visit, thus making sure that his readers will not miss
the significance of the crucial insights that the hero takes to heart. For
example, in <I>Within a Budding Grove</I>, the narrator anticipates how
he will come to understand why Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;'s letters
bring him such pleasure, for she "is an artist of the same school as a
painter whom I was to meet at Balbec, where his influence on my ways of

<B></B>

seeing things was immense. I realised at Balbec that it was in the same
way as he that she presented things to her readers, in the order of our
perception of them, instead of first explaining them in relation to
their several causes" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:703/2:14). In <I>The Guermantes
Way</I>, moreover, the narrator contemplates Elstir's aesthetics with
a completeness of detail that recalls his reflections during the studio
visit. Invited to a dinner party at the duke and duchess of Guermantes,
he asks to see their Elstir collection and forgets about the social
gathering:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Among these pictures, some of those that seemed most absurd to people
in fashionable society interested me more than the rest because they
recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should
never succeed in identifying objects if we did not bring some process
of reasoning to bear on them. How often, when driving, do we not come
upon a bright street beginning a few feet away from us, when what we
have actually before our eyes is merely a patch of wall glaringly lit
which has given us the mirage of depth. This being the case, it is surely
logical . . . to return to the very root of the impression, to represent
one thing by that other for which, in the flash of a first illusion, we
mistook it. . . . Elstir sought to wrest from what he had just felt what
he already knew; he had often been at pains to break up that medley of
impressions which we call vision. [<I>RTP</I>, 2:434-5/2:712-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further on in the same volume, the narrator makes a comparison between
Elstir and himself: "My imagination, like Elstir engaged upon rendering
some effect of perspective without reference to the notions of physics he
might well possess, depicted for me not what I knew but what it saw" (RTP,
2:590/2:856). Clearly, the narrator is well on his way to incorporating
the painter's aesthetics with his own artistic sensibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet although the Elstir episode relates a crucial discovery, Proust has
carefully, albeit indirectly, prepared the reader for it. The manner in
which Proust describes the long prelude to the visit--the train ride to
Balbec, the atmosphere at the seaside resort, Robert de Saint-Loup's
appearance, and so on--is itself exemplary of the aesthetics that the
narrator discovers in the studio and eventually will make his own. At
this stage in the novel, Proust's stylistic solutions become bolder,
as if to reinforce the point that the narrator's artistic education is
well under way. As we shall see, the hero's surroundings are repeatedly
represented as though they were works of art; sometimes they have even
been furnished with a frame. Moreover, each time the visual impression
takes center stage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consider the railway journey which, more than any other episode, works to
warm up the reader. Early in the morning, the narrator wakes up in his
sleeping compartment, and as the train makes its way towards Balbec, he
studies the break of dawn through the square of the window ("le carreau
de la fen&ecirc;tre"). Just above a dark silhouette, he distinguishes
"some ragged clouds whose fleecy edges were of a fixed, dead pink,
not liable to change, like the colour that dyes the feathers of a wing
that has assimilated it or a pastel on which it has been deposited by
the artist's whim" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:704/2:15). No sooner has the narrator
clapped his eyes on the pink light of dawn than he elevates the sight
to a work of art executed by a willful artist. Moments later,

<B></B>

daylight bursts forth, and a cascade of colors--red, blue, mother of
pearl--appear before the narrator, who readily surrenders to the optical
extravaganza:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The sky turned to a glowing pink which I strove, glueing my eyes to the
window ["la vitre"], to see more clearly, for I felt that it was related
somehow to the most intimate life of Nature, but the course of the line
altering, the train turned, the morning scene gave place in the frame of
the window ["le cadre de la fen&ecirc;tre"]  to a nocturnal village, its
roofs still blue with moonlight, its pond encrusted with the opalescent
sheen of night, beneath a firmament still spangled with all its stars, and
I was lamenting the loss of my strip of pink sky when I caught sight of it
anew, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second
bend in the line; so that I spent my time running from one window to the
other to reassemble, to collect on a single canvas the intermittent,
antipodean fragments of my fine, scarlet, ever-changing morning, and
to obtain a comprehensive view and a continuous picture of it ["une vue
totale et un tableau continu"]. [<I>RTP</I>, 1:704-5/2:15-16]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Framed by the train windows, the view of the sleepy landscape
through which the train travels is represented as a series of
tableaux. Scenery follows upon scenery, as in a montage-cut film. Indeed,
the railway compartment moves through the landscape like a projector
apparatus. Naturalizing the deliciously fragmented representation of the
narrator's visual activity, the window frames permit the spectacle to
come into being. In a word, the train has become a vehicle of perception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is more, the narrator's window gazing promotes an aestheticized
way of seeing to such a degree that when the train makes a stop at a
little station, and he catches sight of a peasant girl selling coffee,
his gaze turns her appearance too into a spectacle. "Flushed with
the glow of morning," he remarks, "her face was rosier than the sky"
(1:705/2:16). The sight exalts him. During the train ride, he has let
go of habitual modes of seeing. He has been exposed to a form of beauty
that falls outside of traditional notions and, for this very reason,
is proof of genuine beauty. Now he wants to take a good look at the
peasant girl, and signals that he would like to purchase a cup of
coffee. As she approaches, his gaze puts her appearance behind glass:
"Above her tall re, the complexion of her face was so burnished and
so glowing that it was as if one were seeing her through a lighted window
["vitrail illumin&eacute;"]. She retraced her steps. I could not take
my eyes from her face which grew larger as she approached, like a sun
which it was somehow possible to stare at and which was coming nearer
and nearer, letting itself be seen at close quarters, dazzling you with
its blaze of red and gold" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:707/2:17-18).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This description is remarkable not for what is says about the girl's
looks--after all, we learn virtually nothing about her--but for what
it reveals about the hero's eye. Elstir would have been pleased. The
moment the narrator fixes his gaze on the young woman, her face turns
into a spectacular light show. He is faithful to what he sees, not to
what he knows, and what he sees possesses all the wondrous powers of
the idiosyncratic artist's eye. Indeed, Proust writes not that the
young woman's face is coming nearer but that it is becoming larger:
"je ne pouvais d&eacute;tacher mes yeux de son visage

<B></B>

de plus en plus large." It is as though we were watching a film in
which the heroine's head approaches the camera and eventually fills the
screen. The peasant girl has become pure image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, why does the narrator remark that it is as though he looked at her
through a lighted window, "un vitrail illumin&eacute;"? At first, the
metaphor may seem like mere embellishment. But Proust needs the image of
the window: it motivates the narrator's framed vision and naturalizes his
aestheticized perspective. Proust makes use of a similar technique when,
a few pages later, he introduces Robert de Saint-Loup, a key character
in the novel. The narrator is sitting in the hotel dining-room when he
catches sight of the young marquis. It is a scorching hot afternoon,
the dining room is "plunged in semi-darkness," and through the gaps
between the drawn curtains the glittering blue sea can be glimpsed. Like
Elstir's studio, the dining room emerges as a <I>camera obscura,</I>
complete with apertures. In this giant dark room, the writer-to-be is
busy registering remarkable sights, developing one after the other with
remarkable artistic skill:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[Robert de Saint-Loup] strode rapidly across the whole width of the
hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which kept darting
away in front of him like a butterfly. He was coming from the beach,
and the sea which filled the lower half of the glass front of the hall
made a background against which he stood out full-length, as in certain
portraits whose painters attempt, without in any way falsifying the most
accurate observation of contemporary life, but by choosing for their
sitter an appropriate setting . . . to furnish a modern equivalent of
those canvases on which the old masters used to present the human re
in the foreground of the landscape. [<I>RTP</I>, 1:783-4]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The snapshot of Saint-Loup is a brilliant portrait, the image of the
fluttering butterfly prering the narrator's futile and constantly
suspended attempts to decipher the "true" nature of the marquis--in the
history of art, we recall, the butterfly signifies <I>psyche</I>, the
human soul. The feature that more than any other propels the narrator's
scopophilic will-to-know is, of course, Saint-Loup's homosexuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As in the peasant-girl episode, the sight is framed by the windows
that serve to motivate the delimitation of the narrator's field of
vision. Here, however, the scene is explicitly rendered as a work of
art. The same is true when the narrator enters his hotel room and turns
his eyes toward the window. As in the railway episode, the landscape is
immediately transformed into a series of tableaux, complete with frames:
"Gradually, as the season advanced, the picture [in French, "tableau"]
that I found there in my window changed. At first it was broad daylight,
and dark only if the weather was bad: and then, in the greenish glass
which it distended with the curve of its rounded waves, the sea, set
between the iron uprights of my casement window like a piece of stained
glass in its leads, ravelled out over all the deep rocky border of
the bay little plumed triangles of motionless foam . . ." (<I>RTP</I>,
1:860/2:160).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrator hastens to add that the foaming sea recalls Pisanello's
drawings of feathers and down, and that the creamy white background makes
him think of Emile Gall&eacute;'s carefully etched glass objects. Waves
that look like feathers, foam that appears

<B></B>

as down: such a way of seeing is perfectly consistent with Elstir's
program. The narrator's eye fails to perceive the essential difference
between waves and plumage that his mind will soon discover. The task
of the artist is to remain faithful to the seen, to give priority to
the imagination over and above confining intellectual notions, and the
art-historical re who in this respect exercised the single most
important influence on Proust was John Ruskin.

Proust's interest in Ruskin, the most influential art critic of the

 During a vacation, he read Robert de la Sizeranne's <I>Ruskin et la
 religion de la beaut&eacute;</I> (Paris: Hachette, 1897).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Interestingly, as Richard Macksey has noted, Proust first invoked Ruskin
 as an "instrumentality of sight," since he sent for Sizeranne's Ruskin
 study in order that he, as he said, might "look at the mountains with
 the eyes of this important man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 On the occasion of Ruskin's death in 1900, Proust wrote an obituary
 notice in <I>Le ro</I>, suggesting that the proper way to pay homage
 to the British art critic was to visit the French cathedral cities he
 had written about, as these now "protect his soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Proust himself was to set out on Ruskinian pilgrimages, particularly
 in Normandy. He also went as far as Italy with Ruskin's writings as a
 guide. Most of these trips have left traces in <I>Remembrance</I>. In
 Padua, for example, Proust made sure to view Giotto's frescoes in the
 Arena chapel, half a century after Ruskin's visit, and the event is
 reflected in <I>The Fugitive</I>, in a remarkable episode--I shall have
 more to say about it later--written long after Proust's <I>p&eacute;riode
 ruskinienne</I> had come to an end.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A passionate advocate of Ruskin's theory of art, Proust translated
two of his books into French, <I>The Bible of Amiens</I> (<I>La Bible
d'Amiens</I>, 1904) and <I>Sesame and Lilies</I> (<I>S&eacute;same et
les lys</I>, 1906), both of which he provided with voluminous prefaces
and annotations. What attracted Proust to Ruskin was, among other
things, the emphatic distinction between the observed and the known,
between fresh sensation and dulling habit. "The greatest thing a human
soul ever does in this world is to <I>see</I> something, and tell what
it <I>saw</I> in a plain way," Ruskin writes in his seminal work on
Turner's late manner, <I>Modern Painters</I>. "To see clearly is poetry,
prophecy, and religion,--all in one" (<I>WJR</I>, 5:333; italics in
the original). Stressing that the artist must recover the "innocence of
the eye," Ruskin promoted "a sort of childish perception of these flat
stains of colour, merely as such, without consciousness of what they
signify,--as a blind man would see them if suddenly gifted with sight"
(<I>WJR</I>, 15:27n).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ruskin's hostility to the modernization process runs through all his
writings, a fact, incidentally, that did not escape Proust.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Ruskin railed against the "current political economy," including the
 automation of production and the mechanization of labor; and these
 sentiments were integral to his theory of the visual arts. When Ruskin
 championed Turner's art, he argued for the painter's superiority
 by setting up an opposition between the mechanical and natural or,
 alternatively, the mechanical and the spiritual. Contrasting Turner
 with old masters such as Lorrain, Rosa, and Poussin, Ruskin claimed
 that they submitted to mechanical, hence false, reproductions of nature,
 as they failed

<B></B>

to rise above "the daguerreotype or calotype, or any other
mechanical means that ever have been or may be invented" (<I>WJR</I>,
3:169). Therefore, Ruskin concluded, they lacked in love of the phenomena
represented.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Robert Hewison has underscored, Lorrain, Rosa, and Poussin were
associated with the so-called picturesque.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Deriving from the Italian word <I>pittoresco</I>, or "in the manner of
 painters," the specifically British notion of the picturesque came into
 being as a response to the need for a category that complemented Burke's
 distinction between the sublime and the beautiful. Eminently suited to
 the features of the English countryside, the picturesque referred to
 the particular pleasure evoked by natural phenomena that were irregular,
 rough, and wild--without, however, inspiring awe in the spectator.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Cultivating new modes of seeing, it taught antiquarians, tourists, and
 sketchers how to perceive landscape by way of paintings. In effect, then,
 the theory of the picturesque fostered not pure but essentially derived
 ways of seeing. The so- called Claude glass was part of the didactics
 of the picturesque. A pocket-sized black piece of convex mirror-glass,
 this specular instrument framed and reflected the surrounding landscape,
 thus turning the view into something like a picturesque work of
 art. Ruskin's critique of such visual pleasures was relentless. The
 glass, he argued in <I>The Elements of Drawing</I>, is "one of the most
 pestilent inventions for falsifying Nature and degrading art which ever
 was put into an artist's hand" (<I>WJR</I>, 15:201-2).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ruskin would nevertheless recommend to his students of drawing the
use of an equally mechanical means of reproducing nature, namely
photography. Photographs were to be copied as a form of exercise and
compared for their "authority" (<I>WJR</I>, 15:100-101; see also
21:294-95). In fact, the young Ruskin--the Ruskin of the picturesque
period--celebrated the advent of daguerreotypy, claiming that it beat
his own talent for drawing. "It is a noble invention--say what they will
of it," Ruskin wrote from Venice in 1845, after having procured a few
daguerreotypes of the palaces he had tried to draw, "and any one who
has worked and blundered and stammered as I have done for four days,
and then sees the thing he has been trying to do so long in vain, done
perfectly and faultlessly in half a minute, won't abuse it afterwards."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Later in his career, as an anti-picturesque critic who promoted Turner's
late manner, Ruskin was to attack photography and its automatisms in
contrast to the inherent virtues of painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Artistic seeing was for Ruskin a subjective affair, its empire defined
 by the boundaries of industrial society. For observation to quicken,
 and for sensation to sharpen, he recommended as "little change as
 possible." Ruskin evoked a rural Arcadia lingering in the shadow of
 industrial society:

Proust valued Ruskin's sensibility highly. He adopted Ruskin's belief
in the primacy of sense perception and of the importance of remaining
true to the concrete. He made use of Ruskin's idea that the sensuous
world is a universe of signs that the artist is meant to decipher. Yet,
for all his admiration for the British art critic during the critical
years that preceded his great novel, Proust was nevertheless to invert
Ruskin's attitude toward the historical conditions that had prompted
some of the most important features of the latter's aesthetic program.

The higher the velocity, the more fatiguing travel becomes, Ruskin
maintained. For Proust, the opposite was true. Speed quickened the
eye. Indeed, Proust embraced the new culture of velocity with unmistakable
enthusiasm and was to declare himself a "fervent d'automobilisme,"
a motoring fan.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Even when he traveled in the tracks of the British art critic whose
 work and sensibility he had admired for so long, Proust often chose
 to travel by car, turning the ride into an aesthetic experience of
 the first rank. In 1907, when he motored in Normandy, automobiles were
 still something of a novelty. In 1900, as P&auml;r Bergman has observed,
 there were only about 3,000 automobiles in France, a re that had
 risen to 50,000 by 1909, and to 100,000 by 1913.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Like numerous writers, painters, and photographers, Proust marveled at
 how speed helped transform the perception of time and space.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 In 1904, for example, the French photographer Robert Demachy captured a
 motorcar racing through a curve on a country road, and soon afterwards,
 the image was reproduced in Alfred Stieglitz's avant-garde art review,
 <I>Camera Work</I>. Entitled <I>Vitesse</I>, the photograph indirectly
 addresses a problem that engaged numerous artists at the time: How
 is an image to convey an impression of speed and movement? That is
 to say, how is an image to represent temporal extension? Moreover,
 can the lived experience of locomotion be put into words?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That same year the Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck wrote a short
story about a motoring trip in the countryside. Thanks to the car, the
ecstatic narrator suggests, it has become possible for modern humans to
absorb "in one day, as many sights, as much landscape and sky, as would
formerly have been granted to us in a whole life-time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Set in the neighborhood of Rouen, "In an Automobile" relates how the
 narrator goes for a drive by himself for the first time. He speeds past
 sleepy villages like a missile, cleaving yellow corn fields and red
 poppy meadows. Traveling at a speed of, say, thirty kilometers an hour,
 the motor vehicle turns the quiet country road into a spectacle:

The pace grows faster and faster, the delirious wheels cry aloud in their
gladness. And at first the road comes moving towards me, like a bride
waving palms, rhythmically keeping time to some joyous melody. But soon it
grows frantic, springs forward, and throws itself madly upon me, rushing
under the car like a furious torrent, whose foam lashes my face . . . . It
is as though wings, as though myriad wings no eye can see, transparent
wings of great supernatural birds that have their homes on invisible
mountains swept by the eternal snow, have come to refresh my eyes and
my brow with their overwhelming fragrance! ["IA," 181-82/60-61]

Inert matter is here endowed with anthropomorphic features. All that
seemed solid jumps into motion. In this way, Maeterlinck attempts to
convey a sense of the vertiginous speed with which the motorcar travels
through space. For despite all its impressive horsepower, it is not the
car but nature that acquires agency in Maeterlinck's scenario. It is
nature, not the car, that emerges as a reckless force apparently beyond
masculine control.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Revolving around the thrill of the new, Maeterlinck's short story
emphasizes the miracle of speed and the concomitant transformations of
space. As the vehicle plunges into a valley, the velocity animates the
poor old trees lining the road, and little by little the reader realizes
that the event is of world-historical significance:

The trees, that for so many slow-moving years have serenely dwelt on its
borders, shrink back in dread of disaster. They seem to be hastening one
to the other, to approach their green heads, and in startled groups to
debate how to bar the way of the strange apparition. But as this rushes
onward, they take panic, and scatter and fly, each one quickly seeking
its own habitual place; and as I pass they bend tumultuously forward, and
their myriad leaves, quick to the mad joy of the force that is chanting
its hymn, murmur in my ears the voluble psalm of Space, acclaiming and
greeting the enemy that hitherto has always been conquered but now at
last triumphs: Speed. ["IA," 182-83/61-62]

Thanks to speed, Maeterlinck asserts, man has triumphed over "Space and

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The French writer Octave Mirbeau also conceived a story glorifying
the horsepower of the motorcar. Mirbeau's 1907 novel <I>La 628-E
8</I>, so named after his license plate, relates a motoring trip through
France. In the opening pages, the narrator turns speed into an emblem
of human consciousness in the modern age:

His brain is a racetrack around which jumbled thoughts and sensations
roar past at 60 miles an hour, always at full throttle. Speed governs
his life: he drives like the wind, thinks like the wind, makes love
like the wind, lives a whirlwind existence. Life comes hurtling
at him and buffeting him from every direction, as in a mad cavalry
charge, only to melt flickeringly away like a film ["et dispara&icirc;t
cin&eacute;matographiquement"] or like the trees, hedges and walls that
line the road. Everything around him, and inside him, dances, leaps,
and gallops, in inverse proportion to his own movement; not always
a pleasant sensation, but powerful, delirious and intoxicating, like
vertigo or fever.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Diagnosing life in the modern age, Mirbeau suggests that two features
characterize the world of the living: an overwhelming experience
of speed and an equally overwhelming mass of visual stimuli. Trees,
walls, silhouettes--everything is flickering before the eyes of modern
humans. Described as a succession of moving images, the world emerges
as a film.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both Maeterlinck and Mirbeau explore the syntax of velocity, seeking to
convey a sort of lived experience to which the medium of the printed word
is stubbornly resistant: the bodily experience of speed. Both writers
thus contemplate a representational

<B></B>

problem: how the formal level of description may call forth what is
suggested on the level of enunciation. And in response to this linguistic
challenge, both writers settle on a rhetoric of inversion, substituting
the immobile for the mobile, and vice versa. Mirbeau even writes that
the movement of human beings stands in inverse proportion to that of
the environment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no coincidence that Mirbeau uses cinema as a metaphor to call forth
how the world incessantly races forward and disappears behind the human
subject, for it is indeed film that offers a model for how to represent
the lived experience of velocity. Early cinema specifically experimented
with ways of creating panoramas that simulated speed and movement. From
a historical point of view, Tom Gunning argues, "camera movement began
as a display of the camera's ability to mobilize and explore space."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Up until 1908, when so-called narrative cinema was more fully developed,
 a vast number of film-makers explored speed and movement by mounting
 a camera on vehicles such as subway cars, streetcars, trains, aerial
 balloons, and gondolas. Predicated on the inversion of mobility and
 immobility, this widespread shooting technique produced an optical
 illusion of movement by suggesting that the environment rushed towards
 the camera and, by implication, the spectator.

As early as 1895, shortly after the first screenings of the Lumi&egrave;re
program, the writer H. G. Wells and his collaborator Robert Paul had plans
to construct a cinematic device for simulating movement through time and
space, a visual attraction on the order of Wells's 1895 science-fiction
novel <I>The Time Machine</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The project failed, but the first decade of the twentieth century saw
 the emergence of an array of widely popular fairground attractions that
 similarly produced an illusion of speed and movement. At the Paris
 Exposition in 1900, an attraction called <I>cin&eacute;orama</I> was
 introduced, simulating the experience of traveling in an aerial balloon
 hovering over Europe and Africa.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 The Exposition also included a cinematic attraction called
 <I>mar&eacute;orama</I>, which simulated sea travel--hence the name. The
 trip went from Villefranche to Constantinople via Naples and Venice,
 and came complete with sirens going off and black smoke rising to the
 sky (. <A HREF="8.1danius_1.html">1</A> and <A HREF="8.1danius_2.html">2</A>). A guaranteed success, commented <I>Le ro's</I>
 correspondent on 22 July 1900.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A few years later an American fairground attraction called Hale's Tours
was invented. A worldwide commercial success, especially between the years
1905 and 1907, it offered a synaesthetic experience of railway travel
through scenic landscapes around the world. Audiences were seated in a
railroad car with an open front, which served as a cinematic frame for
motion pictures that had been shot from the cowcatcher of a train. In
assuming the camera's point of view, spectators felt as though they
themselves were moving through space. The swaying of the railway car,
blowing winds, starts and stops, and the characteristic clickety-clack
sound enhanced the experience of virtual movement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The train and the cinema are two distinct sites of spectatorship, to
be sure, but as Lynne Kirby has argued in her work on early cinema,
they share a fundamental affinity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Proust had been a regular contributor to <I>Le ro</I> since 1900, and
in "Impressions de route en automobile" he ventured to capture the optical
thrills he had experienced in Normandy with Agostinelli behind the wheel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 A stylistic exercise in modernist techniques of visual mimesis, the 1907
 article addresses a representational problem: how to render the lived
 experience of speed and movement. The piece relates how the narrator and
 his driver travel along a winding road in Normandy, going from a place
 near Caen to a small town halfway between Lisieux and Louviers. The
 purpose of their trip is to pay a visit to the narrator's parents. The
 purpose of the article, however, is to depict how the motorcar catapults
 through space and how speed transforms the surrounding landscape into a
 phantasmagoria. These descriptions are then flanked by dense digressions
 on architecture, religious art, and the history of travel. Both Ruskin
 and Turner are mentioned, as are seventeenth-century Dutch painters
 such as Philips Wouwermans and Adriaen van de Velde. Proust thus makes
 sure to anchor his speed-infused landscape in the esteemed traditions
 of art history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No wonder, then, that Proust so often resorts to a vocabulary that
revolves around the visual. At the outset, Proust sets the stage for the
optical adventures that will follow by pointing out that the windshields
convert the vista into an aesthetic object: "To my right, to my left,
in front of me, the car windows--which I kept closed--put behind glass,
so to speak, the beautiful September day which, even in the open air, one
could only see as through a kind of transparence" ("Jea," 63). Darting
across the plain of Caen at sunset, the motorists experience a visual
event whose delightful nature is a function of the speed. As we shall
see, the windshields delimit the view of the landscape, converting it
into an object of visual pleasure--a mobile panorama. In other words,
the motorcar has become a vehicle of perception, paving the way for new
forms of aesthetic gratification.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile, it is as though the motorcar is at a standstill while the
environment rushes towards it. No sooner has the vehicle gathered momentum
than the motorists come to witness how ancient buildings spring to life:
"old lopsided houses ran nimbly toward us, offering us fresh roses or
proudly showing us the young hollyhock they had grown and which already
had outgrown them" ("Jea," 63). The inanimate becomes

<B></B>

animate; the immobile becomes mobile. Similarly, when the motorcar
arrives at the foot of the cathedral in Caen, Proust writes not that
the automobile speeds toward it; instead, it is the steeples that throw
themselves at the vehicle, and with such violence that the driver almost
collides with the porch. In reversing mobility and immobility, Proust,
like Maeterlinck before him, seeks a rhetoric of speed capable of evoking
the velocity with which the motorcar traverses the plain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 At the same time, Proust insists on what the motorist perceives and not
 on what he knows. This stylistic technique animates the central panel of
 the article, the artful representation of the steeples rising above Caen:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The minutes passed, we were traveling fast, and yet the three steeples
were always ahead of us, like birds perched upon the plain, motionless and
conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the horizon was torn open like a fog
unveiling completely and in detail a form invisible an instant before,
and the towers of the Trinity appeared, or rather what appeared was one
single tower perfectly hiding the other. But it drew aside, the other
stepped forward and both of them lined up. Finally, a dilatory steeple
. . . had come to join them, springing into position in front of them with
a bold leap. Now, between the propagating steeples below which one saw
the light which at this distance seemed to smile, the town, following
their momentum from below without being able to reach their heights,
developed steadily by vertical rises the complicated but candid fugue
of its rooftops.

The motorized spectator surely knows what the sun-drenched phenomena on
the horizon represent, but he presents them as synechdoches, as part
of a not-yet-revealed whole--as steeples, not churches. The steeples
are a sensuous sign, an enigmatic piece of writing whose meaning awaits
decipherment. In this sense, too, the narrator insists on what his eyes
perceive and not on what he knows, all in an effort to render the lived
experience of speed and the delicious perception of the landscape through
which the car races:

We had long since left Caen, and . . . the two steeples of Saint-Etienne
and that of Saint-Pierre waved once again their sun-bathed pinnacles in
token of farewell. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two
might watch us for a moment still; soon I saw only two. Then they veered
one last time like two golden pivots, and vanished from my sight. Many
times afterwards, when traveling across the plain of Caen at sunset,
I would see them again, sometimes at a great distance, and seeming no
more now than two flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of
the fields; sometimes from a little closer, the steeple of Saint-Pierre
having already caught up with them, they seemed like three maidens in a
legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall;
and as I drew away from them, I could see them timidly seeking their way,
and after some awkward attempts and stumbling movements of their noble
silhouettes, drawing close to one another, gliding one behind another,
forming now against the still rosy sky no more than a single dusky shape,
pleasant and resigned, and so vanishing in the night. ["Jea," 65]

"The psychology of motoring has found its true writer in
Proust," Ernst Robert Curtius notes in his classic study of
<I>Remembrance</I>. Reflecting on the close link between

<B></B>

the narrator's epiphanic moments of inspiration and his speedy movement
through space, in "Impressions de route en automobile" as well as in
<I>Remembrance</I>, Curtius aptly remarks that one cannot imagine Proust
on foot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Indeed, in Proust speed bursts open a new universe. As the immobile
 is set in motion, the artistic eye takes possession of the newly
 transformed visual world, as the following passage drawn from <I>Cities
 of the Plain</I> suggests: "Coming to the foot of the cliff road, the
 car climbed effortlessly, with a continuous sound like that of a knife
 being ground, while the sea, falling away, widened beneath us. The old
 rustic houses of Montsurvent came rushing towards us, clasping to their
 bosoms vine or rose-bush; the firs of la Raspeli&egrave;re . . . ran
 in every direction to escape from us" (<I>RTP</I>, 2:1029-30/3:386).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The proper content of the passage is the excitement of speed, the
throbbing thrill of the new and the estrangement of the familiar. And
if the scenario appears before the reader as though newly caught, it
is because Proust insists on the Ruskinian belief in the primacy of the
perceived. He does so particularly on the syntactic level. Not only is
the motorcar turned into a subject; the vehicle is soon accompanied by
other inanimate objects that also quicken, spring to life, and acquire
syntactical agency: the sea <I>pulls back</I> behind the automobile, the
houses <I>rush</I> toward the motorists, the firs <I>leap</I> to the side
like anxious pedestrians. Here as in "Impressions de route en automobile,"
then, Proust deploys the re of inversion, and the qualities normally
attributed to automobiles--force, speed, mobility--attach themselves to
the immobile environment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 What is more, the passage shows Proust at his most modernistic, for
 at the center stands not a human subject but a motorcar, hailed by
 the futurists as the true incarnation of beauty, second only to the
 aeroplane. Proust makes use of a similar reversal technique when, in
 <I>The Fugitive</I>, he describes how the narrator undertakes a gondola
 trip in Venice. At first the emphasis is placed on the craft and how
 it moves through the neighborhoods, and then the city itself springs
 to life. Like the fantastic steeples rising above Caen, the Venetian
 canals and fa&ccedil;ades turn into a mobile panorama:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

My gondola followed the course of the small canals; like the mysterious
hand of a genie leading me through the maze of this oriental city, they
seemed, as I advanced, to be cutting a path for me through the heart of a
crowded quarter which they bisected, barely parting, with a slender furrow
arbitrarily traced, the tall houses with their tiny Moorish windows;
and as though the magic guide had been holding a candle in his hand and
were lighting the way for me, they kept casting ahead of them a ray of
sunlight for which they cleared a route. [<I>RTP</I>, 3:641/4:206]

Like Maeterlinck and Mirbeau, Proust embraces speed and movement with
striking enthusiasm, seeking to capture the mobile panorama before the
motorists' eyes. Yet although such episodes show Proust at his most
modernistic, perhaps at his most innovative, his stylistic techniques
are not without precedent. As I have suggested, the Proustian mode of
rendering speed and movement is closely related to representational
techniques inherent in early cinematography and turn-of-the-century
fairground attractions.

In the Martinville episode in <I>Swann's Way</I>, Proust makes use of
the motoring article he wrote for <I>Le ro</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 In these inspired pages, however, he drops the narrative about the
 automobile ride, along with the art-historical references and the
 digressions on travel. All that remains is the central panel: the
 mighty vision of the mobile steeples. It is as though the original
 building plan is no longer needed, thrown away now that the edifice has
 been erected. But if the tableau has been stripped of the narrative
 in which it was first embedded, it is also because Proust places the
 picturesque panorama within another story, one which revolves around
 the young narrator's fear that he might never become a writer.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One evening the young hero travels along the Guermantes way in
Dr. Percepied's carriage. Sitting next to the coachman, he comes
to witness how the glistening steeples of Martinville turn into
anthropomorphic characters before his baffled eyes. The sight arouses
a peculiar pleasure whose source is difficult to fathom. He decides to
act on the irksome impulse, borrows a pencil and a piece of paper from
the doctor, and begins to write. It is his first piece of writing. The
emergence of writing, then, is intimately linked to technologies of
velocity and the new spaces of representation they open up.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Later, looking back at the event, the older narrator details the optical
scenario, how the road bends, how the twin steeples appear to change
position, now here, now there, and how, suddenly, they are joined by
a third sunlit steeple. Remarkably, he then proceeds to duplicate the
description of the vertiginous ride and the enchanted steeples. Halting
the diegetic flow, he presents the episode to the reader again--in the
form of the literary fragment drafted on the coach-box. It is the one
and only time that the narrator quotes himself, and the repetition,
of course, underscores the singular importance of the sequence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apart from having been adapted to the Combray topography, and apart from
a few cuts and minor modifications, the fragment is a word-for-word
replica of the centerpiece of the article on the visual pleasures of
motoring written in 1907.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The only difference is that Proust has substituted an old-fashioned
 carriage for the original automobile. There is an obvious reason. The
 Martinville episode takes place in the early 1880s, well before the
 advent of the automobile. Now, presumably the narrator has traveled
 in a carriage many times, so how can it be that he experiences such
 perceptual freshness? As Bernard Guyon has suggested, this is why Proust
 underscores the speedy gallop and Dr. Percepied's exceptional haste.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Hence the dewiness of the narrator's visual experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Martinville episode rounds off <I>Combray</I>, the overture to
<I>Remembrance</I>. But there is more to the episode, for it is to
reappear as a leitmotif within Proust's narrative as a whole, as part of
the overarching theme which revolves around the narrator's distress that
he will fail to become what he so desperately wants to be: a writer. If
one pulls the thread that Proust lays out in <I>Swann's Way</I> and
that runs through the novel up until the penultimate volume, one will
discover some of the stitches that hold the

<B></B>

unwieldy tale together. In <I>The Guermantes Way</I>, the narrator
mentions in passing that he has found the piece about the Martinville
steeples that he wrote on the coach-box of Dr. Percepied's carriage and
that he has submitted a slightly edited version to <I>Le ro</I>
(<I>RTP</I>, 2:412/2:691-692). It seems to have been in vain,
however, for the article fails to appear. In <I>The Captive</I>, the
narrator opens <I>Le ro</I> once again in the hope of discovering
his article in print (<I>RTP</I>, 3:4-5/3:523). A little later,
he repeats the attempt, with the same disappointing result (<I>RTP</I>,
3:114/3:626). It is only in <I>The Fugitive,</I> the next to last volume,
that the plot about the unprinted article reaches its climax and the
piece finally appears in the pages of the Parisian paper. The narrator
swells with pride. He is so taken with the dignity of the event that
he begins to sing the praises of the word, the mass produced word:
"I considered the spiritual bread of life that a newspaper is, still
warm and damp from the press in the murky air of the morning in which
it is distributed, at daybreak, to the housemaids who bring it to their
masters with their morning coffee, a miraculous, self-multiplying bread
which is at the same time one and ten thousand, which remains the same
for each person while penetrating innumerably into every house at once"
(<I>RTP</I>, 3:579/4:148).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The daily paper is to the soul what bread is to the stomach. In Proust's
hands, the newspaper--this profane piece of printed matter that, at best,
enjoys a twenty-four-hour life span before it is degraded into wrapping
paper--acquires almost religious dimensions. The passage alludes to the
episode in the New Testament where Jesus miraculously produces bread to
the hungry masses gathered to listen to his sermon. Rarely has a daily
paper been described in loftier terms. And this in a work of literature
that so emphatically celebrates the <I>book</I>--and certainly not as a
mass product but, as Victor Graham has stressed, as a spiritual entity,
as a soul that happens to reside in a body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The leitmotif weaves its way through a few more pages. When the
narrator runs into monsieur de Guermantes, it turns out that the duke
has failed to notice the article. The next time they meet, however,
the duke congratulates him on a splendid piece of writing and on having
found himself an activity worthy of esteem, but he laments the somewhat
precious and clich&eacute;d style that, to his mind, characterizes large
parts of the text. Tough criticism, to be sure, but what is essential
is that the narrator has won recognition as a writer. In this way,
then, the thematic thread binds together a course of events that begins
with the Martinville episode, when the narrator produces his very first
piece of writing, and that ends when <I>Le ro</I> finally runs the
article and he makes his long-desired debut. Only one thing remains:
for the narrator to write a significant work of literature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When <I>Remembrance</I> was in its beginning stages, Proust played
with the idea of letting the novel open with the episode where the
narrator sees his first publication in print. In these early sketches,
Proust's hero turns around in his bed, just as in the final version. The
difference is that he is anxiously contemplating the fate of the article
he has long since submitted to <I>Le ro</I>. The next day his proud
mother, trying in vain to appear casual and indifferent, enters his
bedroom with a copy of <I>Le ro</I> featuring his article on the
front page. Although Proust was to move the <I>ro</I> episode from the

<B></B>

opening pages of <I>Swann's Way</I> to <I>The Fugitive</I>, the fact that
he originally thought of linking the crucial bedtime episode that opens
the novel to the <I>ro</I> episode affirms the latter's importance
(<I>RTP</I>, 1:633-36, 639).

At the time of "Impressions de route en automobile," as I have suggested,
we find Proust traveling again in Ruskin's footsteps, more than a year
after his <I>p&eacute;riode ruskinienne</I> is commonly believed to
have ended.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 To prepare himself for these excursions, he asked his friend and
 ex-partner Reynaldo Hahn to send him a number of Ruskin volumes
 (<I>C</I>, 7:269-1). It should not come as a surprise, then,
 that the piece of prose fiction which resulted from these trips
 treats a number of typically Ruskinian themes: landscape, travel,
 architecture, painting, seeing; in addition, Ruskin is mentioned twice
 and quoted once. And it is certainly true that Ruskin's spirit pervades
 "Impressions de route en automobile," at least as long as the car is
 kept out of the picture. But the car, of course, is the motor of the
 scenario. It is both part of the spectacle and its very vehicle. Take
 away the car and the speed-infused panorama loses its charge, for
 it is the not-yet-domesticated experience of velocity that, along
 with the window frames, give rise to the visual marvels that Proust
 so painstakingly describes. Thanks to modern technologies of speed,
 a new space of representation has opened up and made itself available
 to aesthetic exploration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The British painter and Royal Academician Hubert von Herkomer once
explained the appeal of the automobile: "The pleasure [of motoring] is
seeing Nature as I could in no other way see it; my car having 'tops,'
I get Nature framed--and picture after the other delights my artistic
eye," he wrote in 1905.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 As Herkomer gazed through the windshield, the view transformed itself
 to a series of tableaux complete with frames. The automobile had become
 a viewing instrument on the order of, say, the Claude glass.

It is hard to think of a more congenial representation of this idea than
Henri Matisse's <I>Le Pare-brise: Sur la route de Villacoublay</I> (<I>The
Windshield</I>). Conceived during a long motoring trip in southern France
in 1916, Matisse's painting takes as its subject a windshield, including
the view of the road and the surrounding landscape as seen through the
windows (<A HREF="8.1danius_3.html"> 3</A>). A study in perspective, the painting foregrounds the
way in which the view is framed, exploring how the three windows delimit
the spectator's field of vision and divide the seen into separate yet
related visual spaces. These spaces, in their turn, transform themselves
into a pictorial suite, into three distinct images--it is as though they
were only waiting to be lifted into the artist's sketchbook. And this
is indeed what is taking place in Matisse's painting. In the right-hand
corner, we glimpse a sketchbook propped up against the steering wheel. The
frame of the sketch under way corresponds to the window frame in the front
which, in its turn, corresponds to the frame of the canvas itself. Such
a complicated play of frames underscores that the painting is more than
a mere representation of the road from Villacoublay; it also

<B></B>

records its own coming into being. Indeed, <I>Le Pare-brise</I> is a
meta-painting. Ultimately, it turns the automobile into a metaphor for
the painter's eye.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"When one crosses a landscape by automobile or express train, it becomes
fragmented; it loses in descriptive value but gains in synthetic value,"
Fernand L&eacute;ger wrote in 1914. Contemplating the affinity between
modern technologies of speed and the emergence of new ways of seeing,
he suggested that the "view through the door of the railroad car or the
automobile windshield, in combination with the speed, has altered the
habitual look of things."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Proust's mode of describing the automobile ride, the excitement of
 speed, and the dazzling views through the windshields is a brilliant
 example of precisely the kind of modernist aesthetic that L&eacute;ger
 promotes in his essay, written half a dozen years after Proust's piece
 was first published. In embracing the modern and making it a vital
 part of his visual aesthetics, Proust effectively negates Ruskin's
 anti-modern spirit. What is most striking, of course, is the fact that
 Proust places an automobile at the center of the spectacle he seeks to
 represent. But there are other features, in "Impressions de route en
 automobile" as well as elsewhere, that bespeak the subtle ways in which
 Proust can be said to invert, even make fun of, Ruskin's anti-modern
 stance. When, for example, the motorists are forced to stop in Lisieux
 because of a mechanical problem, the narrator takes a moment to study
 the fa&ccedil;ade of the cathedral because, as he points out to the
 reader, Ruskin once wrote about it. Night has fallen, however, and
 Lisieux is pitch-black. Agostinelli therefore turns on the headlights
 and directs them at the cathedral's exterior, endowing the porch with
 a halo of electric lighting. Needless to say, nothing could be farther
 from Ruskin's ideal lighting conditions.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a 1909 pastiche, Proust continues his gentle mockery of Ruskin's
programmatic critique of all things mechanical, imagining that the
British critic has penned a description of Paris as seen from an
aeroplane, a piece that, as Proust writes in a humorous subclause,
"is rightly known as one of the master's most refined pieces."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Parodying Ruskin's style, Proust describes sight, sites, and atmospheres
 using the expansive and sumptuous idiom so characteristic of Ruskin's
 works. These poetic impressions, however, are not generated by the art
 critic's pre-technological eye. Indeed, this is not a Ruskin who takes
 slow walks through the countryside but one who darts across the skies
 in a vision machine, reveling in the joy of looking down on the domes
 of Sacre- Coeur. And when the mechanical bird finally descends, the
 creative gaze of the air-borne spectator perceives not the Eiffel Tower
 but the spear of Odin. In Proust's pastiche, then, air travel promotes
 precisely the kind of fresh sensory experience that Ruskin honored.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Distant echoes of the aeroplane motif can be heard in <I>The Fugitive</I>,
in the episode where the narrator pays a visit to the Arena chapel
in Padua. Gazing in amazement at the famous fresco cycle on which
Ruskin dwells in <I>Giotto and His Works in Padua</I>, he is struck
not by the artist's treatment of the Annunciation, the Nativity, the
Crucifixion, and the other Biblical events that make up the glorious life
of Christ. Instead, what catches the narrator's eye are Giotto's angels,
those speedy creatures criss-crossing the heavenly spheres with all the
compelling athleticism otherwise associated with early-twentieth-century
aviation shows:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Constantly flitting about above the saints whenever the latter walk
abroad, these little beings, since they are real creatures with
a genuine power of flight, can be seen soaring upwards, describing
curves, "looping the loop" [in French: "d&eacute;crivant des courbes,
mettant la plus grande aisance &agrave; ex&eacute;cuter des loopings"],
diving earthwards head first, with the aid of wings which enable them
to support themselves in positions that defy the laws of gravity, and
are far more reminiscent of an extinct species of bird, or of young
pupils of Garros practising gliding, than of angels of the Renaissance
and later periods whose wings have become no more than emblems and whose
deportment is generally the same as that of heavenly beings who are not
winged. [<I>RTP</I>, 3:663/4:227]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Without further ado, Giotto's able-bodied angels are here turned into
aeroplanes engaged in a sophisticated air show &agrave; la Roland
Garros. According to Paul Robert's dictionary, this is the first time
that the word <I>looping</I>, in the sense of "looping the loop,"
appears in French.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Ruskin surely would have turned over in his grave at the thought of
 Giotto's heavenly hosts being likened to aeroplanes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Yet, in insisting on the aerotechnical gusto with which they race across
 the sky, Proust pays tribute to Giotto, to all the tangible plasticity
 and muscular vigor that characterize his treatment of the angels. As
 opposed to their ethereal Renaissance colleagues, Giotto's creatures
 have been furnished with real wings and can actually fly. A greeting
 from one artist to another, the episode celebrates the flesh-and-blood
 naturalism that has ensured Giotto such a prominent place in the annals
 of art history. Not only does Proust cancel Ruskin's anti-modern stance;
 he also works out a vital element of his own aesthetics.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay, I have discussed the great extent to which Proust takes
delight in speed and movement, in "Impressions de route en automobile"
as well as in numerous episodes in <I>Remembrance.</I> I have shown how
Proust engages the universe of modernity, flung open by technologies
of velocity, such as the motorcar, and articulated by technologies
of vision, such as cinematography. Beyond this conclusion, however,
there is another and more important one, for the point is that Proust,
precisely by overturning Ruskin's hostile attitude toward the increasing
industrialization of time and space, was able to pay tribute to his old
mentor's aesthetic imperative: to keep to what one sees and not to what
one knows is there.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At one extreme, Proust's novel is given over to a contemplative inquiry
into times lost, exploring the decisive role of the five senses in
the search of the past. At the other extreme, the novel is fuelled by a
passion for the present, a restless, voracious, and transformative passion
that revolves not around memory but around sense perception. If Ruskin
helped give birth to the author of <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I>,
it was to a forward-looking and future-oriented writer with a hearty
appetite for the modern world of technology and the new ways of seeing
it affords. Proust knew how to capture this universe at precisely that
short-lived moment when the distant past rubs against the absolutely new,
when the world suddenly and unexpectedly appears as a swarm of hieroglyphs
crying for decipherment.

Proust reprinted "Impressions de route en automobile" under the title
"Journ&eacute;es en automobile," a name which served as the subtitle
to an essay more commonly known as "Les &eacute;glises sauv&eacute;es:
les cloches de Caen: la cath&eacute;drale de Lisieux," in <I>Pastiches et
m&eacute;langes</I> (Paris: Gallimard, 1919) and added two footnotes. In
one of these footnotes he explains that he chose to recycle parts of the
<I>ro</I> article in <I>A la recherche du temps perdu</I>; he also
points out that in a not-yet-published volume of <I>A la recherche</I>,
the publication of the "fragment" about the steeples in <I>Le ro</I>
would be the subject of almost an entire chapter. My citations

It may well be that Proust, in writing "Impressions de route en
automobile," sought to surpass Maeterlinck's "En automobile." Both stories
are set in the countryside in Normandy; both stress that the motor car
enables modern humans to experience as many landscapes and spectacles in
a day as would formerly have demanded a whole life-time; both attempt
to represent the visual impressions along the road. A great admirer of
Maeterlinck's work, Proust repeatedly returned to the celebrated writer
and playwright in his literary texts and especially in his letters. He is
likely to have read Maeterlinck's "En automobile." The story was published
in <I>Le Double jardin</I>, which came out in 1904, and Proust refers
to the volume that same year. Furthermore, as Philip Kolb has noted, in
the so-called <I>Carnet de 1908</I>, a notebook containing notes towards
<I>Contre Sainte-Beuve</I>, Proust alludes to Maeterlinck's motoring
piece: "Odeur des automobiles en campagne. Maeterlinck a tort" (Proust,
<I>Carnet de 1908</I>, ed. Philip Kolb, Cahiers Marcel Proust, no. 8
[Paris: Gallimard, 1976], 70). Kolb notes, too, that Proust also alludes
to the piece when, in <I>The Captive,</I> the smell of petrol reminds the



narrator of his automobile excursions with Albertine. In addition, Proust
produced a pastiche of Maeterlinck's style; at the end, he touches upon
the automobile theme and the excitement of speed ("L'Affaire Lemoine par
Maeterlinck," in <I>Contre Sainte-Beuve</I>, 197-201). If Proust
indeed sought to outdo Maeterlinck's motoring piece, it is an impulse
that befits what the Martinville episode signifies: the birth of a writer,
untouched by the anxiety of influence.

In a brief article on Proust's cinematic style, Jacques Nantet suggests
that the narrator's car ride as well as the Martinville episode
demonstrate how the "lens moves with the narrative"; see Nantet,
"Marcel Proust et la vision cin&eacute;matographique," <I>Revue
des lettres modernes</I> 5.36-38 : 307-12. Renate
H&ouml;risch-Helligrath has similarly proposed that Proust's rendering
of the car ride is analogous to techniques of cinematic production,
although in her essay, too, the suggestion remains undeveloped; see
H&ouml;risch-Helligrath, "Das deutende Auge: Technischer Fortschritt
und Wahrnehmungsweise in der <I>Recherche</I>," in <I>Marcel Proust:
Motiv und Verfahren</I>, ed. Edgar Mass, Publikationen der Marcel Proust
Gesellschaft, vol. 4 (Frankfurt am Main: Insel, 1986), 22.

That Proust developed what may be conceived of as literary counterparts of
cinematographic techniques, especially montage and close-up techniques,
was noted by several early reviewers. In Proust scholarship, however,
the resonance between Proust's style and cinema has been largely
unexplored. As early as 1914 the French writer and painter Jacques-Emile
Blanche, in a review of <I>Swann</I>, remarked that "Proust has not so
much been keeping a journal as amusing himself with a kind of cinema film,
reconstituting the sequences and <I>posing</I> in it himself for several
characters, throwing, as the whim takes him, the cloak of one around
the shoulders of another, or even wearing it himself" (<I>Marcel Proust:
The Critical Heritage</I>, ed. Leighton Hodson [London: Routledge, 1989],
116). Another critic, reviewing <I>La Prisonni&egrave;re</I> for <I>The
Times</I> in 1924, also underscores the cinematic parallel: "No other
author that I have ever read comes near Proust in the photographic,
or rather kinematographic delineation of a big social 'crush,' with its
tittle-tattle and back-biting, the snobbery and insolent condescension
of its 'great ladies,' its occasional epigrams, its bowing and scraping
<I>super ignes suppositos</I>, its stifling and noxious atmosphere, its
glimpses of queer episodes behind <I>porti&egrave;res</I> and in remote
corridors" (<I>Marcel Proust: The Critical Heritage</I>, 269). Benjamin
Cr&eacute;mieux, finally, remarked that: "Proust has been described as
depicting life in <I>slow motion</I> and this formula has had a certain
success. For all that, it is wrong; it is other novelists who depict
life <I>speeded up</I>" (<I>Marcel Proust: The Critical Heritage</I>,
289-90). For a more substantial attempt to analyze cinematic modes
of representation in Proust, particularly so-called travelings and
close-ups, see Jacques Bourgeois, "Le cin&eacute;ma &agrave; la recherche
du temps perdu," <I>Revue du cin&eacute;ma</I> 1.3 (December 1946):
18-38. Remarkably, Bourgeois goes so far as to argue that Proust
anticipates a more "mature" form of narrative cinema--mature because
psychologically inflected.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT38" HREF="#REF38">38</A>.
Jeffrey T. Schnapp has similarly observed that the reversal re--the
substitution of immobility for mobility, and vice versa--organizes a great
deal of representations of speed and motion in the modernist period. It
recurs, he writes, "in nearly every early description of accelerated
motion and underlies the design of thrill rides in nineteenth-century
amusement parks as well as their cinematic shows: namely, <I>a reversal
of perspective such that it now appears as if it is the landscape that
is in motion and not the traveler; or, rather, that the landscape is
in motion for the traveler</I>." See Jeffrey Schnapp, "Crash (Speed as
Engine of Individuation),"  6.1 (Jan. 1999): 22
(emphasis in the original). Interestingly enough, Schnapp argues that the
re can be traced back as far as to eighteenth-century descriptions
of mail-coach travel. My approach differs from his in the sense that
I am concerned with the ways in which vehicles in motion--trains as
well as automobiles--may serve as visual framing devices and how they,
therefore, share an affinity with cinema. Also, I focus on early cinema
and turn-of-the-century fairground attractions as <I>simulacra</I> of
speed, that is, as <I>means of representation</I>. Combined, these two
aspects constitute what I take to be a specifically late nineteenth-
and early-twentieth-century phenomenon.

Most commentators have read the Martinville episode in the interpretive
terms proposed by the novel itself, concentrating on the question of
literary creation and the mysteries of perspective,



sometimes even extending the reading into mystical or religious
terms. Poulet's formal analysis deviates from this pattern. Arguing
that in Proust travel is even more miraculous than involuntary memory,
Poulet suggests that the travel motif is a structural pretext for bringing
together unrelated objects in space. Moreover, contrary to memory, the
phenomena that travel conjoins do not depend upon resemblances (Poulet,
<I>L'espace proustien</I> [Paris: Gallimard, 1963], 91-105). In
Deleuze's view, the Martinville episode fuels what he perceives as
the novel's global theme: the hero's apprenticeship in the art of
reading signs (Deleuze, <I>Proust et les signes</I>, 2nd ed. [Paris:
Presses Universitaires de France, 1970], 7-9). For Jean-Pierre
Richard, the Martinville steeples are a typically Proustian hermeneutic
object, but also an allegory to be unpacked along psychoanalytic lines
(Richard, <I>Proust et le monde sensible</I> [Paris: Seuil, 1974],
155-67). According to Diane Leonard, the Martinville episode
testifies to Proust's modernism, because it introduces perspectival
illusions and the question of depth into Proust's novel (Leonard,
"Proust and Virginia Woolf, Ruskin and Roger Fry: Modernist Visual
Dynamics," <I>Comparative Literature Studies</I> 18.3 (September 1981):
333-43). Linda A. Gordon claims that the episode is "a model of
the perspectival relationships between subject and object" (Gordon, "The
Martinville Steeplechase: Charting the Course," <I>Style</I> 22.3 (Fall
1988): 402-9). For Howard Moss, the steeples are premonitions,
as they embody a slice of Marcel's hidden future: the writerly
future. See Howard Moss, <I>The Magic Lantern of Marcel Proust</I>
(New York: Macmillan, 1962), 87-103. For a stylistic commentary,
see Luzius Keller, <I>Proust Lesen</I> (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp,
1991), 229-38.

Keith Cohen has similarly underscored the importance of the episode:
"Marcel's experience of seeing the Martinville and Vieuxvicq steeples
from a moving coach makes an indelible mark on the text, since it gives
rise to the first piece of writing <I>within</I> the text attributed to
Marcel himself" (Cohen, <I>Film and Fiction: The Dynamics of Exchange</I>
(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979), 160).

Although the Martinville episode is widely thought of as pivotal
episode in Proust's novel, most critics have neglected the fact that
it derives from an earlier text. Curtius's Proust study offers an
exception, as do Bernard Guyon's and Wolfram Nitsch's articles. Guyon
provides a close reading of the Martinville episode, arguing that the
episode is a "poetical transposition" of the corresponding piece in
<I>Le ro</I>. He also maintains that the novel's genesis must be
sought in "Impressions de route en automobile" which, on his view,
testifies to Proust's greatness as a writer; see Guyon, "Marcel
Proust et le myst&egrave;re de la cr&eacute;ation litt&eacute;raire:
Essai d'explication des 'Clochers de Martinville,'" <I>Annales de
la Facult&eacute; des lettres de Toulouse</I>, no. 1-2 :
37-65. Nitsch discusses the genesis of the automobile motif in Proust
at large, his principal aim being to study how Proust's attitude towards
the motif changes over the years. He concentrates on the <I>ro</I>
article, usefully connecting the visual enigmas triggered by the car ride
to Elstir's painterly aesthetic; see Nitsch, "Phantasmen aus Benzin:
Prousts Automobile in textgeschichtlicher Sicht," in <I>Marcel Proust:
Schreiben ohne Ende</I>, ed. Rainer Warning (Frankfurt am Main: Insel,
1994), 93-108. Carter has also noted the connections between the
<I>ro</I> article and the Martinville episode, although he stops short
of textual analysis; see Carter, <I>Proustian Quest</I>, 135-37.

See Victor Graham, <I>The Imagery of Proust</I> (Oxford: Basil Blackwell,

writer Bergotte in <I>The Captive</I>, where Proust accomplishes one of
his most moving and pregnant images: "They buried him, but all through
that night of mourning, in the lighted shop-windows, his books, arranged
three by three, kept vigil like angels with outspread wings and seemed,
for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection" (<I>RTP</I>,

As Proust's 1907 correspondence shows, he spent August and part of
September in Cabourg, and went on trips "en automobile ferm&eacute;e"
to architecturally significant sites in Normandy. Judging from the
letters, "Impressions de route en automobile" appears to have received
an enthusiastic response from his friends. See, for example, Proust's
letter to Mme. Straus (<I>C</I>, 7:315-6), in which Proust also
refers to Agostinelli's admiring letter; and Daniel Hal&eacute;vy's
letter to Proust which, as Philip Kolb has suggested, was part of an
exchange apropos of the motoring article ( <I>C</I>, 7:320-2).

Things are more complicated, however, for it is clear that Ruskin's
brilliant reading of Giotto's treatment of the angels paved the
way for Proust's aerotechnical imagery. In fact, although Ruskin is
never mentioned by name in the Padua episode, some of Proust's boldest
reflections are indebted to Ruskin: "There is noticeable here," Ruskin
writes in <I>Giotto and His Works in Padua</I>, "as in all works of
this early time, a certain confidence in the way in which the angels
trust to their wings, very characteristic of a period of bold and
simple conception. Modern science has taught us that a wing cannot be
anatomically joined to a shoulder; and in proportion as painters approach
more and more to the scientific, as distinguished from the contemplative
state of mind, they put the wings of their angels on more timidly, and
dwell with greater emphasis upon the human form, and with less upon the
wings, until these last become a species of decorative appendage,--a mere
<I>sign</I> of an angel. But in Giotto's time an angel was a complete
creature, as much believed in as a bird; and the way in which it would
or might cast itself into the air, and lean hither and thither upon its
plumes, was as naturally apprehended as the manner of flight of a chough
or a starling" (<I>WJR</I>, 24:72; emphasis in the original).
