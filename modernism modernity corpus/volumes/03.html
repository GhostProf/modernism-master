Blitzkrieg, one of those international notions of German origin, like 
"kitsch" or 
"kindergarten," sprang from two types of critical discourse or reflection, 
one 
military or strategic and one more sociopolitical or sociopsychological. 
Let me 
briefly characterize them. 
<p>
In October 1941, shortly after the beginning of the Nazi onslaught against 
the 
Soviet Union in accordance with the "Aufmarschanweisung Barbarossa" 
(Barbarossa 
marching orders) 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
one could read the following in a book 
published 
that year: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
It is too early to see more than the widest outline of what is happening 
in the 
largest blitzkrieg of the lot, that on the Russian front. All we can tell 
is that 
there are some signs that the German forces have been slowed down, and a 
number 
of signs show that they are meeting with an opposition not only powerful in 
numbers and materials, but more effective in its tactics than has been met 
by the 
Nazi Army in almost all its previous campaigns. We cannot tell whether this 
opposition will succeed; but we can say already that the Russians seem to 
have 
attempted on a very large scale the creation of a web of defence that 
separates 
the armoured spear-head of the blitzkrieg from the infantry divisions 
following 
it. . . . The blitzkrieg has decided the 
<B></B>
 fate of too many nations. 
The 
principles that I have emphasized here are to my mind the essence of the 
blitzkrieg: concentration for a "rolling thrust," the linking of various 
arms in 
combat teams, large scale counter-attack as one main element in the only 
sort of 
defence possible, and a web of tank-proof islands of resistance as the 
other main 
element.

<p>
This was written by Tom Wintringham in his introduction to the first and 
best 
description of blitzkrieg doctrine we have, Ferdinand Otto Miksche's 
<I>Blitzkrieg</I>. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">
5</A>
</SUP>
Both Miksche and Wintringham participated 
in the 
Spanish Civil War, the first "Nazi laboratory" for the blitzkrieg. Miksche 
was a 
Czechoslovak major on the General Staff of the Spanish Republican Army, 
while 
Wintringham was a commander of the British battalion. Miksche's book is 
the only 
serious study of the epoch, written by an expert and an eyewitness for 
whom the 
principles of blitzkrieg "were well known by 1939, at the end of the 
Spanish War. 
The road that the evolution of war was taking could not fail to be seen by 
an 
attentive observer who studied it in Spain." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
<p>
What is well known by military historians today as the basic concept of 
blitzkrieg was analyzed by Miksche as a combination of two factors, 
dromological 
(having to do with increasing speed) and territorial (space-making): 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The first [features of blitzkrieg] are surprise, speed, and material 
superiority; 
the second ones are motorization as method of transport, mechanization as 
method 
of breakthrough [
<I>Durchbruch</I>
], air action as method of support, 
protection, 
and communication--that gives the warfare of to-day a character entirely 
different from that of the last World War. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Speed and communication, their articulation or linking by means of new 
hard- and 
software technologies, can be seen as the 
<I>differentia specifica </I>
that 
distinguish blitzkrieg from the war machine of World War I. The new era 
that 
blitzkrieg opened in the history of war is characterized by the use of 
communication weapons and transmission media, by what Heinz Guderian, 
commander 
of the tank troops and one of the first theorists of blitzkrieg, called the 
"concert of weapons," a symphony made possible by new communication 
technologies, 
such as FM radio, facilitating the control of command. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">

</SUP>
<p>
The other discourse mentioned has another horizon and another dimension. 
After 
the beginning of World War II, several entries in the 
<I>Arbeitsjournal </I>
(working journal) of Bertolt Brecht refer to the speed of German 
blitzkrieg 
as an astonishing new aspect of the war machine. Brecht characterizes this 
new 
quality as a substitution of the traditional battlefield by what he calls a 
<I>"Schlachtw&uuml;rfel," </I>
a "battle cube" or "battle 
dice." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
Brecht demonstrated a certain amount of knowledge of blitzkrieg strategy 
and 
tactics, which he may have owed to his friend Fritz Sternberg and his 
<I>Die deutsche Kriegsst&auml;rke </I>
(Germany and a lightning war) 
. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">
9</A>
</SUP>
<p>
But what is even more striking than the brief notes that Brecht makes 
(which can 
be considered in relation to the later 
<I>Kriegsfibel, </I>
the "war primer" 
composed together 
<B></B>
 with Ruth Berlau) is his question about the 
specific kind 
of energy that the Nazis brought into being and literally put on wheels 
("Krupp 
steel on wheels") with their blitzkrieg tactics. This issue, which Brecht 
himself 
rated as especially important to a better understanding of the Nazi war 
machine's 
destructive mobilizing drive, is seen as a consequence of deeper structures 
underlying the relation between civil society and violence. He thought 
that many 
"brave antifascists" had failed to understand those relations and therefore 
remained bound to what later on has been called a "helpless and hopeless 
antifascism" ("
<I>Hilfloser Antifaschismus</I>
"). 
<p>
Let me quote just some of his reflections about the new quality of German 
blitzkrieg from his 
<I>Arbeitsjournal </I>
in order to illustrate this idea. 
<p>
30 June 1940: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The slow war brings about the fast one (as the inactive precipitates the 
active). 
but how this speed changes everything! whereas with the Germans it is not 
only a 
question of "blitzkrieg," but also of "blitz-armament." and oh what power 
this 
regime wrests from the breaking of all conventions! the most modern 
weapons of 
the sky mingle with tourist cruisers, Karl May complements Clausewitz. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
9 April 1941, again considering the driving force of the blitzkrieg war 
machine: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
It is as though only this army could move. it alone creates and controls 
the "3-D 
battle-zone" that has replaced the battlefield. conventional armies will 
compete 
this way like the bobbin with the "Spinning Jenny." courage is lost to the 
maneuverability of a vehicle, alertness is lost to punctuality, endurance 
to 
industriousness. the strategy has become surgery. an offensive country is 
"opened" after it has been anesthetized, then blotted, disinfected, 
sutured, and 
so on, all in excellent time. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
29 June 1942: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The "high morale" of the German troops created a major headache for many 
well-meaning antifascists. they had never before encountered the elements 
of 
violence in parliamentary forms of government: the parliaments supposedly 
represented the consensus of the people. now the parliamentary apparatus 
has been 
torn to shreds and the naked violence (stripped of all its veils) has 
become 
visible. this nudity is no longer recognizable . . . for the lower social 
strata, 
enslavement by the Nazis appeared only a relative one, that is to say the 
intensification (of violence) did not exercise any real influence upon the 
behavior of these strata, at least so long as this intensification did not 
itself 
threaten the whole system of slavery. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The point I want to stress, taking Brecht's reflections as in a sense 
symptomatic 
in considering blitzkrieg as the violent eruption of a specific group 
mentality 
particular to a people who had fallen into deep crisis and despair after 
World 
War I, is what has also been stressed by Karl Korsch in his wartime 
correspondence with Brecht as "
<I>Blitzkrieg als geballte linke Energie</I>
" 
("blitzkrieg as concentrated Left energy"). 
<p>
I would like to explore this idea of an alternate construction of 
blitzkrieg, one 
that differs from a typical marxist account. This "rative thesis" (in 
the 
sense of what 
<B></B>
 Walter Benjamin described as a "
<I>dialektisches Bild</I>
") 
circulated among several German intellectuals in exile (Korsch, Benjamin, 
Heinz 
Langerhans, Fritz Sternberg, Wilhelm Reich), who tried to explain Nazism 
and 
fascist war in a way that differed from any Party version. Briefly, some 
main 
points in the argument were formal affinities between fascist mass 
movements and 
working-class movements under the leadership of the German Communist 
Party; the 
fascist recuperation of certain aspects of the workers' organization such 
as 
discipline, a fascination with technology, street demonstrations, etc.; 
and a 
manipulation of social conflicts and property relations in order to draw 
in the 
masses. 
<p>
Heiner M&uuml;ller recalled the idea of "blitzkrieg as concentrated Left 
energy" 
as a ra of the dramatic and dilemma-ridden history of German (and 
other) 
socialist movements. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">

</SUP>
He wrote in his preface to Curzio 
Malaparte's 
war reports, "In the GDR it would have been a text of enlightenment 
[
<I>Aufkl&auml;rung</I>
] about an aspect ignored by the ideological 
consensus of 
the workers' and peasants' state, an aspect that Karl Korsch was the first 
to 
articulate in a letter to Brecht with his thesis on blitzkrieg as 
concentrated 
left energy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
It was in the same spirit that Karl Korsch 
recommended in a letter to Brecht Sidney Rogerson's book,
<I> Propaganda in the Next War</I>, and discussed critically at some length Heinz Langerhans's 
<I>Implications of the Allied Counterblitz</I>, in which Langerhans took 
for 
granted a "world-wide equality of globally accepted blitzkrieg tactics" 
that 
would promote "an invasion of Europe from the west by forces superior in 
number." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
<p>
There are certain remarkable affinities between Korsch's judgment and that 
of 
Curzio Malaparte in his war reports from the Russian front, written 
between June 
1941 and November 1942 for the Milan newspaper 
<I>Corriere della Sera</I>. 
Nazi 
propaganda officials considered these reports a provocation because of 
Malaparte's earlier opinion that World War II on the eastern front should 
be seen 
as a war of two worker armies, and that the morality of the Red Army was 
by no 
means inferior to that of the Wehrmacht soldiers. 
<p>
In 1932 Malaparte wrote 
<I>Der Staatsstreich </I>
(The coup d'&eacute;tat), 
a 
comparative study of armed putsches in Europe after World War I. From the 
perspective of blitzkrieg, and of Malaparte's own war reports, these 
studies may 
illuminate an important difference as well as a connection between a "total 
state" (or totalitarianism) and the "total war" as described in the widely 
read 
book by General Erich Ludendorf, 
<I>Der totale Krieg </I>
, 
blitzkrieg being 
the ultimate form of total war. Brecht and Korsch discussed the impact of 
blitzkrieg strategy while they were under the impression that the German 
Wehrmacht was successful in its offensive against Poland, France, and the 
Soviet 
Union. They saw it as the coming into being of a new form of strategic raid 
(
<I>strategischer &Uuml;berfall</I>
), qualified as such in one of the first 
appearances of the notion in an article published in 1938 by the retired 
Lieutenant Colonel Braun in 
<I>Milit&auml;r-Wochenblatt </I>
(Military 
weekly): 
"The importance of the strategic raid--also called blitzkrieg--is nothing 
less 
than a gigantic assault operation [
<I>Sto&szlig;truppunternehmen</I>
]. 
Everything 
depends on velocity and surprise." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">

<B></B>
<p>
After Stalingrad however, the draconian measures taken by the Nazis in 
order to 
totalize the war--"
<I>Totalisierung des Krieges,</I>
" as Goebbels called 
it in 
his notorious speech in the Berlin Sportpalast on 18 February 1943--were 
propagated as the best way to shorten the war. "
<I>Totaler Krieg--k&uuml;rzester Krieg!</I>
" ("The more total war--the shorter war!") the audience could 
read on 
the huge banner around the wall of the Sportpalast. In reality this change 
in the 
war strategy was a sort of mad drive precipitated by the prospect of 
military 
defeat; this was the turning point in World War II. Thus Goebbels's 
statement, 
"Today we know very well that the blitzkrieg employed in the Poland and 
West 
front campaigns will be of only limited utility for the East," was 
followed by 
the order: "The total war is therefore the command of the 
hour!"

<p>
The Nazi war machine took over all activities of state and civil 
institutions in 
a way described by Gilles Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Totalitarianism is a State affair: it essentially concerns the relation 
between 
the State as a localized assemblage and the abstract machine of overcoding 
it 
effectuates. . . . Totalitarianism is quintessentially conservative. 
Fascism, on 
the other hand, involves a war machine. When fascism builds itself a 
totalitarian 
State, it is not in the sense of a State army taking power, but of a war 
machine 
taking over the State.

<p>
This echoes the theory of Ludendorf's book; he responds to the experience 
of 
World War I by criticizing Clausewitz and calling for a militarization of 
society 
at all levels. Or, as Malaparte wrote in 
<I>Der Staatsstreich</I>, 
pointing out 
the same distinction, "The police defend the state as if it were a city; 
but the 
army attacks the state as if it were a fortress." 
<SUP>

<p>
I want now to comment briefly on two examples that illustrate the idea 
from the 
Korsch-Brecht correspondence of "blitzkrieg as concentrated Left energy." 
These 
examples illustrate a collective mentality formed under the pressure of a 
conration that afflicted Europe between World War I and World War II, 
and may 
help us to consider from a new perspective what has recently been called "a 
bizarre compatibility of elitism and populism in fascism," in which "the 
appeal 
of fascism had to do with its presentation as a total state--one that could 
reconcile the nationalism of the right and the syndicalist revolt of the 
left." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
This perspective may prevent us from falling back in 
the 
trap of "helpless antifascism" and help us to face in a critical way the 
different right-wing movements of our own time. 
<p>
The first example refers to the "Fiume adventure": Gabriele D'Annunzio's 
occupation of the Adriatic city of Fiume for fourteen months after the 
famous 
march from Ronchi on 11 September 1919. The "Poet as Commander" himself, 
making 
use of the prophetic semantics of his name, saw in the Fiume action a 
presage of 
Mussolini's later march on Rome in 1922. In this way Fiume could be 
considered as 
a double re (in the sense of Erich Auerbach's concept), connecting two 
events: Garibaldi's march in 1862 and Mussolini's 1922 campaign. 
<B></B>
<p>
As Emilio Gentile recently pointed out in "Fascism as Political Religion," 
the 
Fiume adventure revealed a clear connection with the national movement of 
the 
Risorgimento, a connection that has been obscured by Mussolini's movement 
and was 
later forgotten by postwar historians. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">
18</A>
</SUP>
But Fiume, according 
both to 
Gentile's convincing study and a recent analysis by Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht 
of the 
nationalist prophecy of this event, cannot be seen merely as a "symbol of 
fascism" any more than D'Annunzio can be seen simply as someone who 
invented the 
rhetoric and gesture of Italian fascism. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">
19</A>
</SUP>
One must not 
overlook the 
driving force of either the Garibaldian tradition, which provided the 
basis of 
popular support for D'Annunzio's adventure, or the force of the other 
tradition, 
which springs from the syndicalism of Georges Sorel, and is present in the 
Carta 
del Carnaro, the constitution of Fiume. 
<p>
In D'Annunzio's speeches on the eve of Fiume, we can see the difference 
between 
him and Mussolini. D'Annunzio is a more authentic representation of the 
national 
and social desires for emancipation, while Mussolini emerges as a violent 
and 
repressive "disciplinarian of exuberant energies." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">
20</A>
</SUP>
This 
difference 
becomes clear when we consider the notion of the sublime, which works as a 
sort 
of leitmotif in the speeches of D'Annunzio. The creation "
<I>di un sublime eroe novissimo</I>
" (of a new sublime hero) to overcome the decadent values of 
western 
culture is seen in the tradition of Georges Sorel. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">
21</A>
</SUP>
It was 
Sorel who 
thought that the liberal bourgeoisie had lost every sense and possibility 
of 
"sublime ethics" the moment it adopted "The Marseillaise" as a simple 
party hymn. 
A new sublime (and a sublime politics) was possible only in relation to the 
emancipatory struggle of the proletariat, for Sorel specifically in the 
form of a 
general strike and 
<I>action directe </I>
(direct action): "Why is it that 
in 
certain countries acts of violence grouping themselves round the idea of a 
general strike, produce a Socialist ideology capable of inspiring 
sublimity, and 
why in others do they seem not to have that power?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The second example refers to the subtitle of my paper and is connected 
directly 
with D'Annunzio's Fiume action. It also marks a clear distinction between 
prefascist discourse and rhetoric in Italy and Germany. 
<p>
In 1922 the thirty-two-year-old Eugen Ortner published a sharply polemical 
essay 
with the title 
<I>Gott Stinnes: Ein Pamphlet gegen den vollkommenen Menschen</I>
(God Stinnes: A pamphlet against perfect man). While nearly forgotten 
today, 
Ortner was, in southern Germany in the 1920s, an author of some renown, 
having 
written plays and novels &agrave; la Gerhard Hauptmann and Frank Wedekind. 
The 
interest and the significance of his 
<I>Gott Stinnes </I>
pamphlet lies in 
the 
fact that amid a large mass of disillusioned postwar writings pertaining 
to the 
perceived negative consequences of the Versailles treaty, against the 
<I>Dolchsto&szlig; </I>
(backstab) legend, amid, therefore, all sorts of 
utopic 
visions offered to a people in despair, Ortner integrated those aimless 
energies 
in accordance with the principles of a totally collectivistic society, 
whose 
dignified and sublime symbol is the character Hugo Stinnes. Stinnes 
represents 
the idealized re of the modern energies of industry and the masses, 
thus 
incorporating the businessman and the leader of the masses at the same 
time: 
<B></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Because in Stinnes and in Lenin, everything is founded upon masses, 
everything is 
collective, and there is no longer any such thing as personal culture. And 
it is 
also certainly true in Stinnes as well as in Lenin that in the end the 
entire 
system is based upon obedience, without which there can and never will be 
organized masses. . . . It can certainly no longer be denied, even by the 
most 
extreme individualist, that we are approaching an era of the mass human 
being. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">

</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Whereas in Spain someone like Ortega y Gasset, in his 1923 essay on 
"Invertebrated Spain," was diagnosing the mass-era critically, Ortner's 
prophecy 
is purely apologetic. Ortner is nonetheless realistic in pointing to the 
authoritarian tendencies in the postwar society of Germany (and in Europe 
generally). Ten years later, the analysis of German workers and low-level 
employees that was conducted by the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research 
revealed, as we may remember, the danger of a widespread authoritarian 
mentality. 
<p>
In the aftermath of the Stinnes-Legien Treaty, signed by Hugo Stinnes on 
behalf 
of the Unternehmerverb&auml;nde (the associations of the entrepreneurs) 
and by 
Carl Legien, the chief of the General Commission of the German Trade 
Unions, on 
15 November 1918, Ortner's text can be read as an apologia. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
More 
significant, however, is the rhetorical device that concentrates social 
energies 
on a single point: the integrated power of the machines and the masses. It 
is 
this same point that, transformed into pure destructive power, goes on to 
constitute the blitzkrieg war machine. The sublime becoming pure sublime 
in its 
fascist form: that is to say, eliminating all elements such as fear, 
horror, and 
critical self-consciousness--all of which have constituted since Kant the 
notion 
of the modern sublime--and substituting for them pure monumentalism, 
heroism, 
populism, and the F&uuml;hrer cult. 
<p>
Ortner describes this dynamic as the substitution of the "totality man" by 
the 
"combinatory man," the symbolic re of the former being D'Annunzio. 
Thus he 
bids "Goodbye to D'Annunzio" ("
<I>Abschied von D'Annunzio</I>
"): 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
There is no path joining Hugo Stinnes's world of experience to that of 
Gabriele 
D'Annunzio. No clearer illustration can be found of two worlds, one in 
decline 
and the other on the rise, than in these two types. In fifty years, a 
person who 
even slightly resembles D'Annunzio will no longer be possible in Europe. 
Not that 
I am comparing him in any way with all of those vain individuals who I have 
listed here. We take leave of him with the kind of cheerful melancholy to 
which 
the last totalitarian member of a great, dying culture is entitled. Stinnes 
destroys D'Annunzio, Stinnes destroys the artists. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">
25</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The annihilation of the artist by the re of "God Stinnes" can be read 
as an 
image of the dissolution of the sublime. D'Annunzio's still-political 
sublime is 
deconstructed, with "God Stinnes" as the new energetic artist--be it as the 
politician incarnated as a fascist F&uuml;hrer, or as a commander of the 
blitzkrieg war machine (Heinz Guderian, for example, a commander of tank 
troops, 
considered himself an artist). 
<B></B>
<p>
As we know, a modern concept of the sublime can be seen historically as 
emerging 
from the experience of war and of revolution. Edmund Burke wrote on behalf 
of the 
sublime and against the French Revolution. Francisco Goya represented 
another 
re of the sublime in his 
<I>Collosus</I>, in the 
<I>Caprichos</I>, and 
in the 
<I>Desastres de la guerra</I>. He shaped a critical sublime that, in 
Picasso's 
<I>Guernica</I>, with its depiction of the first experience of blitzkrieg 
attacks 
by the Nazi "Legion Condor" in 1937, opened a new era of the political 
sublime as 
art form. 
<p>
The conration of a specific fascist sublime, which according to Walter 
Benjamin can be considered the epicenter of the aesthetization of politics, 
contributed to a generalized suspicion of the sublime as a conduit of 
ideological 
mystifications and the engineer of reification. It seems, however, that the 
sublime is with us more than ever. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The very condition of late capitalism is to render thought (but not the 
writing 
of critical essays) impossible. Commodities circulate in a dizzying vortex 
of 
speed; simulacra hollow out a vast abyss in the place of the real; Elvis is 
everywhere. Fredric Jameson calls this a hysterical sublime; Baudrillard 
stays 
cool. . . . [Kant] describes the sublime . . . as follows: the sublime 
presents 
an object that exceeds cognition, and the subject experiences a mixture of 
pleasure and pain, pain at the incapacity of the faculties to come to 
terms with 
this object and pleasure at the capacity of the faculties to recognize 
their own 
incapacity.

The apparently seamless forms of commodification that now characterize 
global 
capital and the boundless conration of a New World Order present us 
with a 
dynamic sublime at once excessive and ubiquitous. Money in capitalism thus 
becomes, in Terry Eagleton's words, "an infinitely spawning signifier 
which has 
severed all relation to the real, a fantastical idealism which blots out 
specific 
value as surely as those more conventional res of sublimity--the raging 
ocean, the mountain crags--engulf all particular identities in their 
unbounded 
expanse."

The commodity moves in "an unstoppable metonymic 
chain in 
which one object refers itself to another and that to another, to 
infinity." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">

</SUP>
At the same time, the electronic technology that 
permits 
the accelerated solubility of one commodity into another, that speeds up 
circulation by eliminating the material weight of the commodity, rendering 
it 
increasingly virtual, introduces the mathematical sublime, those 
inconceivably 
small mechanical and logical components of artificial intelligence. 
<p>
These are, basically, arguments whose roots lie in the critical theory of 
the 
Frankfurt School. Along with the Toronto School of Communication, albeit 
in a 
different way, the Frankfurt School writers were among the first to 
recognize the 
critical problems posed once information itself becomes a matter for work 
and 
commodification, once a culture industry causes or allows representation to 
inhabit the base as well as the superstructure, confounding the distinction 
between production and reproduction. 
<p>
We may recall Adorno's assertion that "the Absolute became absolute 
horror"; 
German culture, the insistence on the autonomy of the spirit and the 
absolute 
<B></B>
 nature of idealism, participated in a motion that culminated in 
Auschwitz. 
This is, according to Joshua Halberstam, the inhuman and cruel consequence 
of 
every idealism taken to its extreme. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Kant does not entail Auschwitz. That charge would be an outrageous 
calumny. But 
Kant leads to Auschwitz. He leads to other places as well--some heroic and 
ennobling. But any moral theory which begins by disregarding human 
sentiment, 
caring and sympathy, might well end in crematoria. In the legend, God 
takes hold 
of compassion and creates a world. In the twentieth century the Nazis 
renounce 
compassion and almost destroy that world.

<p>
So what about the sublime, and a politics of the sublime, given this 
perspective? 
<p>
I think we have to distinguish a fascist sublime--in the sense of the 
Nazis who 
considered themselves to be the movement of 
<I>national Erhebung </I>
(insurrection), etymologically drawn from the original German term for 
the 
sublime, the 
<I>Erhabene</I>
--from another notion of the sublime. Since 
"all 
efforts to render politics aesthetic culminate in one thing: 
war," 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">
30</A>
</SUP>
and since Kant himself noted war as an example of the dynamic sublime in 
<I>The Critique of Judgment</I>, it is tempting to assume that the invocation of 
the 
sublime belongs entirely on the side of fascism in this dichotomy. The 
sublime 
introduces terror and death into aesthetics; having accepted terror and 
death as 
primarily aesthetic rather than political, fascism seeks to return them to 
society. Fascism's aestheticization of politics is the extraction of all 
political meaning in favor of aesthetic criteria. 
<p>
Thus the depoliticization of the sublime, for which blitzkrieg and its 
discourse 
offers a symptom, symbol, or re, consists in the application to 
politics of 
indeterminate judgments, judgments of taste, as if they were determinate: 
we have 
an idea of the beautiful, and we will make society conform. The idea of 
beauty, 
for example, will find its fulfillment in the social order: in the ordered 
hierarchy organized alongside a return to feudal elements, to 
<I>Blut und Boden</I>
 (blood and soil). This paradoxical understanding goes 
hand-in-hand with 
an appeal to the dynamic sublime on the grounds of technical 
modernization, an 
attempt to make society embody the idea of pure energy rather than mere 
order. We 
can see this in the re of blitzkrieg, for instance, that appears in a 
speech 
made by Hitler to delegates of the League of German Girls (BDM) at the 1935 
Nuremburg Party Rally. This is one of the first recorded allusions to the 
term: 
"I shouldn't negotiate for months beforehand and make lengthy preparations, 
but--as I have always done throughout my life--I should suddenly, like a 
flash of 
lightning in the night, hurl myself upon the enemy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">
31</A>
</SUP>
<p>
In this sense, a fascist politics of the sublime attempts to present the 
unpresentable, to materialize the idea of energy. The effect of such 
realization 
is to make politics entirely a matter of representation and hence of 
cognition, a 
process of domination that is essentially totalitarian. Fascist 
totalitarianism 
proceeds from the claim that the idea can be an object of cognition, that 
the law 
can be fully represented, in order that determinate judgments can be made 
in 
reference to it. The effect of this, 
<B></B>
 the essence of such a 
<I>gleichgeschaltete </I>
(homogenizing) society--emerging in the 
post-World War I 
era as a movement toward total war, total state, total 
enemy 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">
32</A>
</SUP>
--is to 
preclude any possibility of dispute: the terror of fascism consists in 
saying 
that we are just because we know what justice is. (Remember G&ouml;ring 
proclaiming, "
<I>Wer Jude ist, bestimme ich!</I>
" ["I determine who is a 
Jew!"] 
to those who criticized him for retaining a Jewish general in the 
airforce.) 
<p>
Fascism's politics of the sublime consists in a replacement of cognition 
by will. 
Blitzkrieg is the ruthless transformation of will into violence. 
<p>
I will conclude by saying that blitzkrieg, after its success at the 
beginning of 
World War II and its failure after Stalingrad, and beyond its further 
application 
in other wars, has become an icon representing dangerous tendencies and 
despairing sentiments in the collective mind. We need not look far in 
order to 
observe the transformation of blitzkrieg into a collective symbol. 
<p>
During a German television program about new radical movements in Germany, 
the 
reporter interviewed young members of various so-called right-wing 
movements. 
Among them an approximately twenty-year-old girl, Uschi, said her interests 
included competitive sports, skinheads, Germany, music--and gave as her 
nickname 
"Blitzkrieg." The reporter, visibly astonished, was at a loss and had to 
move 
on.

At a large demonstration in the summer of 1994 on Berlin Alexanderplatz, 
the 
Brechtian actress K&auml;the Reichel referred to the disastrous effects of 
German 
unification on culture in terms of blitzkrieg: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
All conquerors, regardless of whether they came with weapons, dazzling 
glass 
beads, money, or goods, always began by destroying the culture of the 
conquered 
land. And if any proof is now necessary in Germany that since November a 
war has 
been taking place, a German blitzkrieg, then let it be the interaction of 
the 
victors and their paid enforcers with the culture of this 
land.

In October 1990 a London newspaper published an article by G&uuml;nter 
Grass with 
the headline, "The Business Blitzkrieg." Grass explained to his English 
readers 
his well-known critical position on the German unification process and its 
universal significance. He mentioned that after the monetary union in July 
1990 
the media used the term "blitzkrieg" in a highly euphoric manner: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The way in which the D-Mark has been held up as an article of faith is 
frightening, as if thoughtlessness could be compensated for by money. The 
way in 
which the discussions about the future capital (Berlin) were relayed at 
full 
blast through loudspeakers was worrying. The standardization of public 
opinion, 
as expressed across the spectrum from 
<I>Der Spiegel </I>
to 
<I>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung </I>
to 
<I>Die Ziet</I>, had an oppressive effect. In 
both 
parliaments the initial State Treaty was thoughtlessly rushed 
through. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">

</SUP>
And it was frightening to read reports of success 
according to which the strategy of the blitzkrieg is now showing its 
strength in 
peacetime by means of a politico-financial pincer movement. Who should not 
feel 
ever more anxious, when German recidivism is 
<B></B>
 demonstrated on a daily 
basis, when carefully learned democratic virtues lose their market value 
overnight, when there is even to be unification of the State Security 
Services, 
when--once again--the largest opposition party ducks the issue because it 
has to 
worry about the slightest reproach of "lack of patriotism"?

In another context, but with striking similarities, Heiner M&uuml;ller 
explained 
his conviction that Japan and Germany are the actual winners of World War 
II, 
given the application of blitzkrieg strategies to market economy. For 
M&uuml;ller, blitzkrieg is a result of the modern industrialization of 
war, "the 
continuation of economy by other (military) means, leading through total 
realization [
<I>Verwertung</I>
] of labor power in the concentration camps, 
to 
annihilation of production in extermination. Auschwitz as an industrial 
product." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">

Blitzkrieg is seen as a sort of double re 
(again 
recalling Auerbach) strategically positioned between pre- and postwar 
economic 
struggles. 
<p>
The idea that media not only played an important role in the blitzkrieg war 
machine, but created a particular space for perception, has been related by 
Marshall McLuhan who describes, one might say, the shift from the ivory 
tower to 
a control tower as a way of approaching our work as critical "headworkers": 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The first and most vital step of all . . . is simply to understand media 
and its 
revolutionary effects on all psychic and social values and institutions. 
Understanding is half the battle. The central purpose of all my work is to 
convey 
this message, that by understanding medias as they extend man, we gain a 
measure 
of control over them. And this is a vital task, because the immediate 
interface 
between audile-tactile and visual perception is taking place everywhere 
around 
us. No civilian can escape this environmental blitzkrieg, for there is, 
quite 
literally, no place to hide. But if we diagnose what is happening to us, 
we can 
reduce the ferocity of the winds of change and bring the best elements of 
the old 
visual culture, during this transitional period, into peaceful coexistence 
with 
the new retribalized society.

Whatever this utopian version of a new tribalism might entail, McLuhan's 
warning 
should be heeded, it seems to me, especially when we face violence. Given 
our 
experience with the new electronic media blitzkrieg of the Gulf War, we 
are at 
the beginning of a new era in the modern history of warfare and of civil 
society, 
an era increasingly threatened by tendencies toward a total state. And 
these 
recent invocations of the term and concept of blitzkrieg show that we 
remain--not 
just on the Left and the Right but in the Center too--na&iuml;vely 
enchanted by 
this terrible idea.

<p>
The social-psychological attempts to uncover an "explanation" for the 
susceptibility to fascism often revolve around certain relatively abstract 
psychological mechanisms: underdeveloped ego, sadomasochism, sexual 
anxiety, authoritarianism, and crises of identity have all been 
suggested. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">
1</A>
</SUP>
I don't want to take up this tradition of 
psychological investigations of fascism here; rather, I want to back up a 
step and move toward a much more specific description of the content of 
the wishes, anxieties, and conceptions of men and women during the 
National Socialist era. What occupied their thoughts, and what aspects of 
National Socialism addressed their wishes and anxieties? 
<p>
These questions emerge from the tradition of Ernst Bloch's objections to 
his communist friends of the 1920s right up to the 1962 edition of 
<I>Erbschaft dieser Zeit</I>
 (Heritage of our time), in which he spoke of 
a "helplessness" against the "deceitful intoxication" of the Nazis, of the 
"uncontrollable attractions," and of the "desire for an unclear something 
else" that found their expression in the pro-Nazi movement in Germany in 
the 1920s and 1930s. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">
2</A>
</SUP>
Bloch complained at the time--and it 
remains a pressing issue today--that "leftist" analysts of fascism, such 
as those by G&eacute;org Luk&aacute;cs and Karl Kautsky, derided the 
contradictions of Nazi ideology with a "tender arrogance" (
<I>"weichem Hochmut"</I>
 [
<I>EZ,</I>
 146]), diagnosing the low intellectual level and 
barren rhetoric of the Nazis from a stance of crystal-clear Enlightenment. 
Many texts concerned with the theme of women and fascism adopt a similarly 
superior attitude in describing the reactionary, misogynistic program 
<B></B>
 of the Nazis. Such blood-and-soil stereotypes of 
women as 
<I>Geb&auml;rkuh,</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
the blond Gretchen, the 
selfless and self-sacrificing mother, and the hero's widow are constantly 
disproved. Often, "impossible" quotations are piled up one after 
another--Alfred Rosenberg, for example, is always a good source. Though it 
is not the intention of the critics, this way of presenting the 
antifeminist program of the Nazis makes the success of National Socialism 
even less understandable; unless one wants to ascribe that success to 
female stupidity, this mode of presentation doesn't explain why those 
against whom the program was so clearly directed went along with it. 
<p>
Klaus Theweleit, in his analysis of the "male fantasies" 
<I>("M&auml;nnerphantasien")</I>
 that he found in the protofascist 
writings of Freikorps soldiers, also warned of the danger of antifascist 
criticism placing itself in a position of radiant enlightenment, hovering 
far above the object of study. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">
4</A>
</SUP>
If I didn't allow these 
objects to speak, if I didn't attempt to place myself among the pro-Nazi 
women, if--I am willing to assert--I didn't attempt to feel as they felt, 
I would understand nothing of the fascination of fascism. 
<p>
This call for understanding the feelings of the objects of study is 
especially applicable to fascism in all its forms, since the 
psychologizing of politics was central to fascism's success. The Nazis did 
not attempt to win over potential voters with a concrete political program 
or proposals to reorganize society. Their widely interpretable slogans 
appealed to an emotional accord. Over the years only two central elements 
of the program remained constant: anti-Semitism and a militantly 
expansionistic nationalism--and even these were not clearly formulated. 
Many other elements were diffuse, did not lend themselves to concretion, 
were not translated into institutional pragmatics, and so allowed for 
contradictory interpretations. In terms of the political program 
concerning women, Rosenberg's notion of the woman as the servant of the 
man coexisted for years with views such as those of Sophie 
Rogge-B&ouml;rne, who saw the woman as equal to the man in a communal 
t. 
<p>
The vagueness and multiple meanings of Nazi ideology arose on the one hand 
from the inability to achieve a politics that matched reality, and on the 
other hand from the conscious goal of addressing and uniting the most 
diverse factions. They point above all, however, to the aestheticization 
and depoliticization of the public-political discourse, in which the event 
replaced the argument or at least notably reduced its importance. A few 
points along these lines: 
<UL>
<LI>
Many listeners describe the effect and the power of Adolf Hitler's 
speeches. Hardly any of them can remember what Hitler said. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">

Ernst Bloch quotes a Nazi saying that proclaims, "One does not die for a 
program that one has understood; one dies for a program that one 
loves." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
<LI>
Hitler writes in 
<I>Mein Kampf</I>
 of the masses that "The emotional 
engagement [of the masses] . . . depends on their extraordinary stability. 
Belief is much more difficult to shake than knowledge; it is less love 
than attention that lies behind change. Hate is more durable than 
dislike." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
</UL>
<B></B>
<p>
The intensity of an unmediated experience, the vehemence of a suffering 
gesture in which, as Bloch says, "the phrases have drunk blood" and the 
"exhausted ideologies" achieve "an almost puzzling fire"--this side of 
fascism must be understood, not only the terror, the racist persecution, 
the history of everyday life. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
Certainly this other side was 
more important in the "movement" period than in the period of 
consolidation of National Socialism or during the war, but the promise of 
escaping the everyday routine kept many loyal until the end. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">

<p>
In the very reflective and detailed record of her impressions from the age 
of seven to twenty years old (1932-45), Eva Sternheim-Peters defends 
herself against the social-psychological suppositions of what constitutes 
the passive authoritarian character. She relates the mobilization of the 
populace toward Nazi conformity to "the debureaucratization and heroizing 
of political events . . . with feelings of strength, suffering, 
determination, ability, and pride." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">

</SUP>
The central concept of 
<I>Volksgemeinschaft</I>
 (community of the people) is associated in her 
memory with an "indeed occasionally exuberant, but usually restrained, 
inner, elemental, and at the same time painful, sense of happiness that 
was called camaraderie, community, and security." She speaks of a "magical 
spell" that maintains its hold to this day, despite all critical 
distance. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
This longing for an increased intensity of life 
was certainly not uncommon--it only now becomes clear to me, for example, 
that even my mother had addressed something similar with her own central 
justification for National Socialism: ". . . but the torchlight 
processions!" 
<I>(". . . aber die Fackelz&uuml;ge!")</I>
<p>
What follows will be based on these heterogeneous and briefly outlined 
arguments, which speak to why it seems sensible to try to understand the 
power of fascism's attraction, to concern ourselves with people's desires. 
It will not be sufficient to see things only from the perspective of 
women. Investigations of political issues and voting practices have shown 
that, despite the antifeminism and the radical separation of the male and 
female spheres, the same themes were relevant for women as for men in 
political events, and above all those concerning the national question, 
the disgrace of Versailles, and the Weimar system, which meant chaos, 
violence, and economic decline. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
Did women really not 
recognize explicitly antifeminist positions of the Nazis? Did they really 
transform them into their own conceptions of emancipation? Or did they 
take the empty rhetoric concerning the dignity of woman seriously? To 
some, National Socialism seemed to guarantee a deeper and truer 
emancipation of women than did the women's movement, which was concerned 
only with equality in the social sphere. The Nazi catch-phrase 
"emancipation from women's emancipation" 
<I>("Emanzipation von der Frauenemanzipation")</I>
 played to a widespread bourgeois, anti-Semitic 
resentment of the politics of interest, which was associated with the 
practices of egoistic hucksters and traders. The Nazis presented 
themselves as representatives of deeper, holier values, for whom the 
search for a public-political compromise between particular interests was 
suspended in a (fictive) sphere of camaraderie. We find such conceptual 
models not only in women's politics; they are, in fact, a central motif of 
Nazi politics. "Emancipation from emancipation": this rhetorical phrase 
promises true freedom without the need of a laborious 
<B></B>
 daily battle for individual rights, without having to change a thing; 
Nazi women could idealize themselves, rendering the women's movement 
worthless. 
<p>
The revalorization and emancipation of women was, however, not simply a 
rhetorical trick; it also offered concrete opportunities to break narrow 
and familiar normative and religious ties, through work and women's 
organizations such as the official League of German Girls (Bund deutscher 
M&auml;del, or BDM), which granted unheard-of opportunities for 
self-organization and access to public spaces. One further point that can 
make this feeling more understandable is the racist model. As an Aryan 
female, every German woman occupied a position far above any Jewish man: 
racial struggle replaces gender struggle. As a custodian of the race on 
the battlefield of the war for a higher birth-rate, she was at least equal 
to the man in importance: birth-battle = war. Thus we see that there were 
gender-specific reasons for girls and women to direct their desires toward 
fascism. But the concentration on only the female perspective leads us 
astray. 
<p>
All psychological investigations into the susceptibility to fascist 
thought emphasize a point that, viewed in developmental psychological 
terms, deals with very early levels of development: the fear of vitality, 
of multiplicity, the different, the chaotic, and at the same time the 
desire that is directed at a sexualizing of aggression. Whether it is 
Wilhelm Reich's "fear of orgasm" 
<I>("Angst vor dem Orgasmus")</I>; Erich 
Fromm's "fear of freedom" 
<I>("Furcht vor der Freiheit")</I>
 and 
necrophilia; the sadomasochistic organization of the authoritarian 
personality according to Theodor W. Adorno, Daniel J. Levinson, Else 
Frenkel-Brunswik; Klaus Theweleit's "danger of vitality" 
<I>("Gefahr der Lebendigkeit")</I>
--all these writers describe in similar terms how 
National Socialism blocks the fear of ego-disintegration through the 
creation of a rigid coat of armor, and allows for living out sexualized 
destructiveness as well as narcissistic fantasies of grandeur. These are 
not only "male fantasies." When one looks at only one gender, the 
underlying dynamic is lost in the polarity of male-female. Luce d'Eramo, 
for example, has reflected on the fact that, in the fascist rhetoric of 
suffering, prescribed for every party member, the man is ascribed 
traditional female characteristics. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">
13</A>
</SUP>
Devotion, submission, 
dedication, personal ties within a hierarchy, relinquishing of the 
self--these traditionally female qualities are ascribed to the fascist man 
as a servant of the party. In this regard, the fascist cult of masculinity 
can be understood as compensation for this step toward feminization. 
Hitler himself compared his followers to women; the masses were at once 
defined by a longing for more power and a willingness to bow down to the 
strongest and those who tolerated no equals. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">

<p>
A number of researchers explain women's support for the Nazi regime in 
terms of their specific situation of oppression, arguing that women 
misread National Socialism as a chance for emancipation. This line of 
argumentation assumes that women were shaped by what Margot Komann has 
called a "desire for social and economic autonomy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">
15</A>
</SUP>
This is 
precisely what we cannot assume with any degree of certainty. It is for 
this reason that I want to take up the question, What actually were the 
desires of women? The desire for social and economic autonomy seems to me 
to be very much determined by reason. Can this desire also be represented 
psychologically 
<B></B>
 on a deeper, more emotional 
level--is autonomy really a 
<I>desire?</I>
 How do women conceive of the 
division of power between the sexes? 
<p>
If one reads the memoirs and documents by and about women during the Nazi 
era, one finds a preponderance of "private" themes. In the memoirs of Leni 
Riefenstahl, the Third Reich serves simply as a backdrop to her 
experiences in the mountains, in film-making, and with the Nazi bigwigs 
(Hitler, Goebbels), all of whom desire her and all of whom are rejected by 
her.

Many documents support this tendency of women to be concerned almost 
exclusively with the interests of the private sphere, including those 
women who were situated very closely to the centers of power or who were 
themselves involved. This acceptance and endorsement of the exclusion from 
the public sphere has been very differently interpreted by various 
scholars. Annette Kuhn, for example, states, "The apparently privatist 
conception of feminine life, such as a woman's care for her husband, 
children, and the people in her immediate environment, undergoes a radical 
re&euml;valuation under the terroristic conditions of the 
regime." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
The capacity of this type of women's work to 
maintain and give meaning to societal conditions is clear, but, at the 
same time, the "relationships maintained by women, which elude the total 
functionalization and the reaches of the State, could become under fascism 
a governing moment of a political, antifascist culture." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Claudia Koonz refutes this notion; the acceptance of the withdrawal into 
the feminine world of the family and the private sphere is, for Koonz, 
precisely the location of women's collaboration with Nazi 
rule. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
In their concentration on the family and marriage, 
women could provide a life for men in a second world, in which values 
other than those "outside" applied--in which men could view themselves as 
husbands and fathers, as valuable human beings. The men reserved the 
standards of ethics and morality for private life and did not relate them 
to their actions as executors of the Nazi rule and its terrors. Women 
guaranteed a familiar haven for an emotional refueling, which rendered 
possible the normalization of the Terror. "How were you able to carry on 
in the terror that surrounded you?" the journalist Gitta Senery asked the 
Treblinka commander Stangl; he answered with a reference to his wife and 
his love for her. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">
25</A>
</SUP>
Accordingly, the private is the real. Thus 
women cultivated ignorance of extrafamilial reality, and allowed men to 
join them in this illusion. 
<B></B>
<p>
Many accounts present an image similar to those depicted above. Yet it 
seems to me that the limitation of this private-sphere oriented behavior 
to women is too rigid. It does not address the reality of a broader 
depoliticization that concerned both sexes. The same retreat into the 
private is present in the correspondence and autobiographical observations 
of men as well. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">
26</A>
</SUP>
<p>
I consider the second objection to Claudia Koonz more significant, and to 
address Annette Kuhn's thesis about the collective culture of the 
relationships of women, which she views as the basis for an antifascist 
culture. I believe that the ideas, conceptions, values, and models of 
relationships in the private world are connected to political programs and 
social principles. The family as a counterculture, opposed to society, is 
an illusion. Familial and psychological structures are stamped by society 
even at the level of the unconscious, even if not always directly. This 
banal thesis has very important consequences for our study. In this way, 
the entertainment films of the Nazi era have long been seen as a diversion 
from the political events and military defeats of the Nazi regime, rather 
than as worthy of examination in terms of their structural mutuality with 
National Socialist ideologies. 
<p>
The investigation of analogies, compensatory relationships, and 
similarities between private fantasy, artistic production, and the 
political lends itself particularly well to the study of National 
Socialism, because here the political level is to a high degree 
psychologized and personalized: the history of the world as betrayal, 
Germany as lover and mother, the Jews as guilty of 
everything. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">
27</A>
</SUP>
I would like to document these affinities 
between the private and the political with two literary examples:  the 
1936 novel for young girls, 
<I>Das M&auml;dchen Peter und der Fremde</I>
(The girl Peter and the stranger)--the author, Auguste Supper, is a 
convinced National Socialist--and  a few excerpts from Ina Seidel's 
1930 novel 
<I>Das Wunschkind</I>
 (The wish-child), which should outline a 
representation of the maternal woman. Seidel, who characterized this novel 
as her favorite, was an active sympathizer of the Third Reich, as well as 
a highly acclaimed author in bourgeois circles both before and after 1945. 
This is clear in the publisher's notes to the 1958 edition, which state 
that Seidel stands "at the peak of creative women's art in Germany" 
<I>("an der Spitze der sch&ouml;pferischen Frauendichtung in Deutschland").</I>
 The very high circulation of the novel is further 
evidence of her success. I cannot and do not wish to undertake a textual 
analysis of either book here; I would only like to single out those 
attributes by which the female res are characterized. How are their 
relationships represented? Which position in the hierarchy of the sexes 
does the author ascribe to them? How are femininity and masculinity 
constructed? What psychological functions can certain images of men and 
women fulfill? 
<p>
I choose these particular literary productions because I believe that the 
women here, under the aegis of fiction, escape some of the constraints of 
self-representation and are thus closer to the level of their desires, 
their wishes. It is this level and its affinities to representations of 
National Socialism that concern me here. 
<p>
I have also chosen these examples because I was forced to recognize in 
each my own proximity to the enthusiasm for the fascistic. Ina Seidel was 
my mother's 
<B></B>
 favorite author, and I myself thought 
highly of her melancholic 
<I>Dunklen Erz&auml;hlungen</I>
 (Dark stories). 
At about age twelve, I found the second book, 
<I>Das M&auml;dchen Peter und der Fremde,</I>
 in my parents' bookcase and read it avidly many times 
without understanding that it was pro-Nazi. 
<p>
Beyond the reason of personal motivation, both novels are frequently cited 
in the work of Godele von der Decken, the author of an analysis of women's 
literature under National Socialism entitled 
<I>Emanzipation auf Abwegen</I>
 (Emancipation gone astray). In addition to analyzing official 
documents, she examines fifty-six novels by women and sets out typical 
themes, patterns of relationships, and plot development. Both of the 
novels I've selected can stand as characteristic examples of National 
Socialist women's literature according to the patterns she describes, even 
though Seidel's book had already appeared in 1930. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B><I>Das M&auml;dchen Peter und der Fremde</I></B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
This novel is written from the perspective of an approximately 
thirty-year-old man who has not yet regained his footing after World War I 
and now, during the period of the Great Inflation, is supposed to go to 
work at the Berlin Bank, where his cousin is employed, to learn the 
banking industry. This is a prospect that everything in him resists. 
During an accident, he comes to the aid of a young "boy"--actually the 
seventeen-year-old girl Peter, who masquerades as a boy. The man stays for 
a few days in the house where Peter lives with a servant, a maid, an older 
half-sister, and a crippled younger brother. The family makes its living 
from farming, and all of them are dissatisfied with the conditions of 
their lives. The stranger senses a vague and uneasy anticipation. The 
often irritable brother, ruled by extreme moods, dies on his own birthday, 
because his sister allows him to fulfill his fondest wish, to ride the 
horse that had belonged to their father, who had died in the war. The girl 
Peter does not open up to the stranger; only now and then does her 
vulnerable side emerge. In the end, Peter and the man want to run the farm 
together, while the sister is to marry a war comrade. 
<p>
This novel thus follows the model of 
<I>The Taming of the Shrew</I>
 and 
<I>Trotzk&ouml;pfchen</I>
 (The stubborn little child).

At 
first the girl is wild and strong, but by the novel's end she is renamed 
Petronella, and only wants to wear women's clothes. But this does not come 
until the end. Throughout most of the novel, she is far and away the 
strongest and most affectionately described character, inviting the 
reader's identification. 
<p>
How, then, is she characterized? 
<p>
First of all, by external appearance (what follows are quotes, with 
quotation marks and page references omitted): 
<UL>

A sweet youth of slender build

A well-defined, streamlined, pale face, with a not very high, but clear

Personality and behavioral patterns:

Impudent like an ill-bred child: talkative, flippant, condescending, 
saucy, lively, contemptuous, overbearing, impatient, didactic, pitiless, 
hard, genuine, headstrong, disparaging, boyishly coarse, arrogant 
<LI>
She says, "No one needs to help me," and does in fact master a great deal: 
she can do carpentry, bake, tend the garden, till the soil, build houses, 
organize, and lead. 
<LI>
Insolence is counteracted by her extreme diligence and efficiency. 
<LI>
She does not spare herself or others, hates passionately all that is weak 
and scorns the pity engendered by the death of her brother. 
<LI>
Her pubescent, blustery, and obstinate character is contrasted by a 
further quality: the shimmer of depth, wisdom, a transcendental connection 
to "wondrous infinity." 
<LI>
Nature speaks to her; she sees and hears the voices of the dead (her 
idealized grandfather). 
<LI>
"Her whole character was reverence and tranquility, as the man could 
never 
have imagined in her." These abilities, which prompt boundless admiration 
from the man, stem from her inner connection to Nature: "She felt her way 
in any direction, even toward the furthest depths and the deepest 
mystery--always stumbling across the Natural."

One is at first amazed by this portrayal; these images do not fit the Nazi 
clich&eacute; of the blond and braided Gretchen who, in eager expectation 
of future maternal joy, wriggles her broad hips into skirts that make them

 girl of women's 
literature to be 
<I>the</I>
 Nazi portrayal of woman, because only such 
extreme images were conveyed to the postwar generation to which I belong. 
Yet 
<I>Das M&auml;dchen Peter,</I>
 as von der Decken writes, is the most 
frequent type found in the German woman's novel of the Nazi era: "As a 
girl, this favorite type of woman [von der Decken calls her 'the 
autonomous heroine'] is pert, sporty, independent, and unconventional, in 
addition to being diligent and rooted to the earth."

<p>
Diverse, even contradictory, elements are bound together in this image of 
the seventeen-year-old woman: 
<UL>
<LI>
A rebellious aspect: the revolt against gender conventions, the longing 
for wildness, a lack of self-control, and unchecked aggressivity 
<LI>
She has to pay for her rebellious wishes: she is extremely industrious, 
constantly working, "as even the Devil has to admit" ("das mu&szlig; ihr 
der Teufel lassen"), as the sister says repeatedly. Even the novel's love 
scene develops from a debate over agricultural methods. Settling and 
agricultural work are the legacy of the father; they bind her to the moral 
world order. Efficient women and men raise healthy children "in order to 
lay the groundwork for the next level of our eternal existence"--the 
"egoism" of the woman's rebellion is justified only toward this 
end. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">
32</A>
</SUP>
<LI>
What seems more vital is the compensation for female inferiority through 
the third model from which Peter is composed: the image of the god of 
Nature, the administrator of the voice of the blood, of rapture, and of 
eternity. The most secret depths of the origins, unattainable to the man, 
are accessible to her, to female essence in general. 
</UL>
<p>
These fantasies are often found in Nazi publications (but not exclusively 
there, of course). Woman as a type is always placed beyond history. She 
is, in the end, undisturbed by the to- and fro-ing of human activity, 
representing the eternal law of Nature. Man is indeed the ruler of 
history, but his power is only a drop in the ocean of Nature. Woman, as 
representative of Nature, stands above man where it really counts. The 
dependence on the female gender guarantees this unquestioned superiority. 
This theme is fundamentally related to the highly idealized realm that 
could ground masculine dominance: being a soldier in war. In 
<I>Das M&auml;dchen Peter,</I>
 war is "a wholly poetic, a wholly intensified 
life," in which a man feels like a young god, in which a feeling of 
competence and omnipotence develops. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">
33</A>
</SUP>
But what can he 
actually do? Supper asks critically. Only the arts of war occur to him. 
Outside of war, man is like a fish out of water, and so it is with our 
hero. Peter must teach him balance, for he is indecisive, vacillating, 
often irritated. That will be forgiven him in light of his lieutenant's 
commission. But she has continuity on her side--she is his superior in a 
deeper, realer sense; her flightiness is only superficial. 
<p>
Nevertheless, she is always (apparently) seeking greater strength in the 
man. "Whoever is stronger than I, shakes me and must shake me," she says 
to him. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">
34</A>
</SUP>
She gets her orientation from her dead grandfather, 
whom, as soon becomes clear to the stranger, he is to replace as the new 
leader of the family, bringing the three siblings together, and 
establishing harmony, peace, and quiet. These wishes constitute the high 
point of the love scene: "The lush spring landscape lay uncertain as the 
quiet of night sank into it. How teeming with secret streams of life it 
stretched out [sic]; its breath seemed to say: 
<I>'Heimat!'</I>
 ['Home!'] 
The two no longer knew whether these 
<B></B>
 pulses and 
streams came from within or without, as their young lives seemed to become 
one with everything." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">
35</A>
</SUP>
<p>
A melding that dissolves all borders, in which inside and outside become 
one, the boundaries between the sexes are suspended and all that divides 
is leveled. Erotic tension and bodily attraction do not develop. Only the 
man has a few attacks of desire, which he wards off with the inner 
"command of the battery": "Girls will not be shot at!" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">
36</A>
</SUP>
His 
desire is thus stigmatized as a highly aggressive act. She wipes away his 
single kiss and polemicizes several times against the idiocy of being in 
love. After the kiss the man must leave to take the bank job in Berlin. 
Brother, father, and grandfather are all dead; a relationship with a 
living man is not part of the book. The longed-for narcissistic symbiosis 
with the man, idealized as a disembodied God-Father, can only be realized 
in an exceptional situation. Men are either distant or dead objects of 
desire to which longings are attached; these men should not come any 
nearer, or become real. 
<p>
In her work on Nazi-era literature written by women, von der Decken 
considers the "autonomous heroine" 
<I>("autonome Heldin")</I>
 to be the 
preferred type of woman in fifty-six of the novels she analyzes: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Man and woman exist in divided spheres, between which mediation is hardly 
possible--indeed, they are often described as being fundamentally 
antagonistic. . . . Eroticism is taboo. . . . Women, however, consciously 
adopt the role of appearing as the gender 
<I>kat exochen,</I>
 and develop 
a subjectively experienced position of power: even if it is not possible 
for them to influence societal processes directly, only they can guarantee 
the survival and continuance of society.

<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
Ina Seidel's 
<I>Das Wunschkind</I>
 is similarly concerned with this aspect 
of the image of woman--motherhood. I will take up only the beginning of 
this voluminous novel. The novel takes place during the Napoleonic Wars. 
The protagonist Cornelie's first child dies, and the same night she 
becomes pregnant with the child she has always dreamt of having. Her 
husband must go to battle the next day, and is killed. She raises the 
child, converts to Catholicism, and manages her father's property. The son 
becomes an officer and dies in battle. She makes plans to raise the 
children of fallen officers to become officers themselves. 
<p>
From the beginning, Cornelie is introduced as a mother-re. A single 
clause describes her appearance as "dark-haired and pale," and then the 
reader goes on to learn: "She had the tough tenderness of her 
Mecklenburgian mother in her blood, the warm force of the soil that grows 
wheat. Her love was a quiet and dark glowing flame, a longing in her 
breast to clasp her beloved, to bear and nourish children: 
motherliness." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">

</SUP>
<B></B>
<p>
Self-sacrifice and staying behind are, however, always bound up with power 
for Seidel: Cornelie is ascribed a "burdensome power that engenders 
timidity." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">
39</A>
</SUP>
In the opening scene, Cornelie's husband first 
realizes in the bedroom that he has let himself be sent away from his 
son's deathbed by his wife and mother. He feels unbearably lonely, 
abandoned by both women: "In view of the circumstances of the slow death 
of his child he felt his own power dwindling to the same degree as that of 
the women increased. . . . He felt with an almost tearful pain that such a 
display of power had never been marshaled against the unnameable 
<I>[das Unnennbare]</I>
 as occurred today." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">
40</A>
</SUP>
He understands then that 
the women have also given him up, that they see his death accompanying 
that of the child, and he resigns himself to this. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
With the sweet taste of his wife's blood on his tongue, he knew: death 
does not mean death. . . . To be able to perish in her lap, meek and 
small. . . . To be the seed that sank into the earth, to have relinquished 
itself, passed away and yet to live: to become a child again, nothing but 
her child . . . now he would be able to die, now he would be able to 
submit to death and to fall, to fall not unlike how fruit falls from the 
tree. . . . 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">

</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Before it comes to this--his death is worthy of nothing more than a 
phrase--he obeys the call of the earth and "obeys most passionately his 
wife, who wound her arms around his neck and was devoid of all desire 
except the will to fertility." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">
42</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Perhaps this macabre metaphor--the man dying in order to be able to sink 
as seed into the earth, to sink into the woman, with his death as the 
precondition of her fertility--seems too bizarre for us to conclude 
anything about the longings of women under fascism. Von der Decken, 
however, presents far more extreme examples from other novels in which the 
masculine soldier's death is coupled with feminine fertility. These are 
fantasies in which the traditional roles of men and women appear to be 
exchanged: "The man becomes a sexual object, who surrenders his healthy 
semen in order to make possible for the woman the ancient feminine 
experience of motherhood." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">
43</A>
</SUP>
Von der Decken sums up her 
analysis of the relationship of femininity and the soldier's death: "The 
path of a woman to autonomy and power leads over the corpses of her 
fathers, husbands, and sons." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">
44</A>
</SUP>
<p>
After the death of her husband, Cornelie is more than just a mother to her 
child; like the girl Peter she is the center around which the characters 
revolve. She is placed high above the sister-in-law, who is entirely 
absorbed in her existence as a mother and whose exclusive interest in the 
welfare of her children is devalued as narrow-minded and selfish. 
<p>
Cornelie also proves herself in the course of the novel to be superior to 
all men. Often the men are initially presented as idealized, but upon 
closer observation they prove to be superficial, bound to the moment like 
children, particularly when they express their sexual needs. Men's 
vulnerability to sexual temptation makes them appear to be frail, 
laughable beings "with red faces." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">
45</A>
</SUP>
The only scene in which 
Cornelie is conscious of her own sexual desire for a man is quickly 
brought to an end by a debasing infantilization of the man. Cornelie 
presents herself with a choice: man 
<B></B>
 or child. She 
decides in favor of the child and experiences with him that same night the 
following scene: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The child stretched out his arms insistently. She . . . pressed him to her 
breast and sank back with him into the cushions. The child, weaned for 
just a few weeks, pressed against her, his mouth searching; she let him do 
what he wanted and lay quite still, until shortly, his lips let go and he 
sweetly fell sound asleep, breathing lightly. . . . Everything was good; 
the current was restored. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">

</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
With the grown man, her sexuality 
is deadened: "her thoughts disappear," she wishes to sink down, "the 
ground beneath her feet [splits] into a gaping hole," she is at the end of 
her strength, and ultimately loses consciousness. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">
47</A>
</SUP>
Sexuality 
is the absolute threat to feminine autonomy and can be experienced without 
danger only with the child: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
That the boy lived in her so completely and stayed living in her . . . 
that everything that he began to grasp and comprehend was imbued with her, 
with her warmth, [with] her voice, that, for the time being, the world was 
mediated through her alone . . . this was the reason that she had to 
extend herself, and for years the walls of her identity felt as though 
they had dissolved. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">
48</A>
</SUP>
This is a dissolution of identity in the 
service of extending the child's identity. Seidel's formulations do indeed 
sound extreme, but given clinical terminology, psychoanalysts are saying 
the same thing--"primary motherliness" is a "benign 
psychosis."

<p>
To summarize these reflections on the novels: there are two types of women 
that at first glance appear very different--the rebellious, androgynous 
young girl on the one hand, and the resigned, sacrificing mother on the 
other. Despite the differing types, however, there are similarities: 
<UL>
<LI>
Both women lead a strong, independent life without men. Men, however, are 
granted authority as the dead or as superelevated God-Father res. 
<LI>
Both women gain their own power by becoming equated with Mother Nature, 
the Earth--that is, with eternal, natural law by which historical events, 
traditionally carried out by men, are suspended. 
<LI>
The full presence of the husband is not possible. He is infantilized, 
devalued, or sent to war to die. 
<LI>
Strength and autonomy in one's own life plan is possible only through an 
active and aggressive control of sexuality, which is, in turn, relegated 
to men and resisted. 
<LI>
Sexuality and aggressivity are strongly separated and aggression is 
racially directed. 
<B></B>
<LI>
Mothers do not exercise their power in order to prevail as social 
combatants, but rather in the collecting of sons, whom they then send 
forth as actors. Women become invisible. 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Does all of this exist only in novels? I don't think so. Nearly all of the 
patterns identified here can be recognized again, for example, in the 1941 
series of letters, mentioned above, by a "hero's mother" to her son in 
Russia. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">
50</A>
</SUP>
The patterns are also almost identical to those of 
the party biographies of female Nazi campaigners, which the historian 
Margot Komann has analyzed. These women addressed the topic in a 1935 
magazine of "How I Became a National Socialist" ("Wie ich 
Nationalsozialist wurde"). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">
51</A>
</SUP>
Komann sums up her analysis of 
the material: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
Those women who devoted themselves to National Socialism were particularly 
susceptible to the false solutions of the imagined world of National 
Socialism. This became for them the public sphere, in which they staged 
their fantasies of grandeur. In this process, they spared themselves the 
conflict with the authorities that was due, the laborious process of 
social behavior responsible to the self."

<p>
The picture-puzzle 
<I>(Vexierbild)</I>
 of the man, who is either idealized 
as a kind of distant super-father or devalued as an actual man, coheres as 
a representation that allows the preservation of women's grandiose 
fantasies and avoids a reckoning with reality.

der Natur. 'Wohin sie auch tastet--und wenn es in fernste Tiefen und an

It was originally my interest in Roger Caillois--sociological essayist, 
erstwhile surrealist, and cofounder of the College of Sociology--that led 
me to the forgotten avant-garde writer Armand Petitjean, an acquaintance 
of his youth in the 1930s. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">
1</A>
</SUP>
This philosophical essayist 
published four major works, now almost entirely inaccessible outside the 
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale: 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
(Imagination and realization [1936]), 
<I>Le Moderne et son prochain</I>
(Modern man and his fellow man [1938]), 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires</I>
 (Preliminary combats [1941]), and 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 (The unveiling [1946]). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">

</SUP>
<p>
Petitjean seemed to represent an interesting case against which to gauge 
the political ambiguities of the left-leaning and antifascist College of 
Sociology, whose actual relation to fascism is a matter of some 
debate. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
In the French context, the issue of fascist ideology 
per se is complicated by the question of individual political choice or 
action during World War II. As did the College of Sociology, Petitjean 
protested against the predominantly pacifist, 
<I>munichois</I>
 (i.e., 
pro-Munich Accords) mood of French intellectuals in 1938. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">
4</A>
</SUP>
He 
then fought the Germans with particular patriotic zeal until the Armistice 
of June 1940, losing part of his right hand. Yet after 1941 he became an 
active collaborator--unlike any core member of the College of Sociology. 
Switching sides again in late 1943, he fought with the Allied forces, only 
to be condemned by the postwar literary 
<I>&eacute;puration</I>
 (purge): 
his name appeared on the first "blacklist" decreed by the CNE 
(Comit&eacute; national des &eacute;crivains [National writers' 
committee]) in September 1944. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">

</SUP>
<B></B>
<p>
From late 1940 through 1941, Petitjean worked for the Vichy administration 
in the interrelated spheres of youth and propaganda. His career was 
largely sponsored by the former Communist Paul Marion, who became 
Fran&ccedil;ois Darlan's notorious minister of information (February 
1941-April 1942) and who then, "having helped undermine the Darlan 
government in March-April 1942, remained as head of propaganda efforts 
under [Pierre] Laval," to quote Robert Paxton. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean 
thus played an active role in the 
<I>chantiers de jeunesse</I>
 (youth 
workcamps). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
A young pawn of complex political maneuvers, he 
was unsuccessfully backed by Marion and others in May 1941 for the 
leadership of the Compagnons de France (Companions of 
France). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
After this defeat, according to Pierre Hebey, he 
then sought to form the Jeunesses l&eacute;gionnaires (Legionary 
youth). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">
9</A>
</SUP>
Unconfirmed allusions in Pierre P&eacute;an's 
biography of Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand even suggest that the future 
president was a youthful "follower" of Petitjean. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">
10</A>
</SUP>
<p>
After the war, Petitjean was blacklisted as a writer because of 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires,</I>
 a collection of essays written at the military 
front (1939-40) and after the Armistice, which delivered, in 1941, a 
clearly collaborationist message. His publications under the aegis of 
Vichy also included articles for 
<I>Compagnons</I>
 (Companions), 
<I>Jeunesse</I>
 (Youth), at least one for 
<I>La Gerbe</I>
 (The sheaf), and 
nine contributions from January 1942 to August 1943 to the monthly, 
nonofficial publication, 
<I>Id&eacute;es: Journal de la R&eacute;volution Nationale</I>
 (Ideas: journal of the national revolution). He wrote six 
articles between 1940 and 1943 for the Paris-based 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 which had become collaborationist with the new 
editorship of Drieu la Rochelle (July 1940-June 1943), since the German 
invaders hoped to preserve this journal as a "strategic bastion of 
Literature," in the words of Hebey. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
Bernard Comte suggests 
that it was after Petitjean's defeat in Vichy in the summer of 1941 that 
he returned to Paris and to the 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
where he served as Drieu's editorial assistant. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Partly because Petitjean had fought so heroically (on the proper side), 
Jean Paulhan, the magisterial editor of the prewar 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 did spring to his defense in 1947, in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 (On the wheat and the chaff); we will return to 
Paulhan's famous, if cryptic, assault on the censorious strategies of his 
fellow literati. More recently, Hebey's survey of the collaborationist 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 from which Paulhan dissociated 
himself in 1940, cites two trenchant participants in twentieth-century 
intellectual life--Claude Roy and Ren&eacute; Etiemble--both of whom deem 
Petitjean's case a uniquely thorny postmortem of the postwar. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">
13</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Petitjean's career offers a unique perspective on the question of fascism 
and modernism in the French context, one that illuminates it more broadly. 
In ideological terms, Petitjean's career adds an interesting wrinkle to 
debates about the relation between intellectual nonconformism and fascism. 
"Nonconformism" generally indicates the ideological fluidity of the French 
1930s, and specifically refers to those nonpartisan intellectuals who 
rejected not only political parties of the Right and of the Left but 
parliamentary democracy as well. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">
14</A>
</SUP>
In a more cultural sense, 
emerging as it does within the "surrealizing" 
<I>("surr&eacute;alisant")</I>
 avant-garde, Petitjean's ambiguous 
<B></B>
 path offers a new vantage on the complex interaction of 
political and literary, and political and aesthetic, discourse in this 
milieu. Why did this particular nonconformist member of the avant-garde, 
unlike so many others, become a true political fascist? Does he differ 
significantly in this respect from his patron at the collaborationist 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 Drieu la Rochelle? 
<p>
The only real discussion to date of Petitjean is that offered by Hebey, 
who claimed in 1992, "[He] has done everything he could to be forgotten. 
After 
<I>Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 [1946] . . . he definitively opts for 
silence and retirement." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">
15</A>
</SUP>
And yet, upon reading this, I 
recalled that I had seen Petitjean's byline in the September 1989 issue of 
<I>Le Monde diplomatique</I>
 on an article entitled "Toward Man's Contract 
with Nature," in the series Inventing a Future for the Planet. I soon 
discovered that his recycling as an ecological thinker had begun in 1973, 
when he assembled and introduced a collection of essays for the Club of 
Rome, a rather secretive group of industrialists propounding no-growth 
development. The Club of Rome is deeply revolutionary, Petitjean wrote at 
this time, "but leaves off at the threshold of politics, in the 
traditional sense of the term." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">
16</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Some forty years earlier, Petitjean had given his own twist to the term 
"availability" 
<I>("disponsibilit&eacute;")</I>
 for politics in his 1937 
essay "Disponsibilit&eacute; de la jeunesse fran&ccedil;aise actuelle" 
(Availability of youth), a polemic demanding that France acknowledge the 
untapped energy of his generation. He lent availability the new political 
sense of an energetic and affective openness to event--rather than to 
ideology or party--that would render his generation the agent of 
history. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean hailed "men of good will, of plasticity 
to history." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">
18</A>
</SUP>
Of course, historical plasticity denotes 
passivity to event; properly to 
<I>make</I>
 history, these young men must 
be oriented and led by "'revolutionaries' who, more conscious than they, 
act in coordination with them." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">
19</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean consistently 
presents his own authorial and intellectual role as that of an 
<I>active</I>
 revolutionary who stimulates "coming-to-consciousness" 
<I>("prise de conscience").</I>
 Yet his own career reveals a pronounced 
historical plasticity. My primary purpose here is to explore the 
"revolutionary" historical plasticity--or, perhaps better, "revolutionary 
plasticity"--of his conceptual framework as it encountered the march of 
history: we will find there, I am proposing, a rather distinctive 
conjunction, within the French context, of modernism and fascism. 
<p>
Omitting, for now, the distinction between belief and opportunism, I 
intend to highlight three essential, and interrelated, factors in 
Petitjean's particular form of "fascist modernism." First, we find a cult 
of ideological and intellectual indeterminacy; second, a paradigm of 
revolutionary consciousness detached from any real ground in 
sociohistorical crisis; and third, a vitalist obsession with youth. 
<p>
In order to situate Petitjean vis-&agrave;-vis current historical 
discussions of ideological nonconformism, let us glance quickly at his 
evolution during the 1930s. Born in 1913, he had become active by 1935 in 
a cultural milieu for which the surrealist movement was a primary point of 
reference, although Petitjean was himself more inclined to the modernism 
of James Joyce and of German 
<I>Lebensphilosophie</I>
 (life-philosophy). 
<B></B>
 Having left the &Eacute;cole Normale after one year, 
he participated, as did Caillois, in 
<I>Les Cahiers du sud</I>
 and became, 
again like Caillois, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jean Paulhan, of the 
nonpartisan 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise.</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">
20</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan's own complex ideological nonconformism, currently the object of 
some scrutiny, found in the youth a congenial political 
interlocutor. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">
21</A>
</SUP>
This was especially true after 1936, when 
political questions dominated the cultural scene. Aligned then, unlike 
Paulhan, with the leftist and antifascist Popular Front, Petitjean in July 
1936 both proclaimed an imminent New French Revolution and put forth an 
ambiguous plea for fresh doctrine. On the one hand, he declared, "French 
revolutionaries find a magnificent future in their past." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
On 
the other hand, he contended, "since reactionary traditions are poorly 
established in France--or, rather, obsolete--French 'fascists' must 
innovate." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
From late 1937 through the end of 1938, he wrote 
a weekly column, Battle of the Books, for 
<I>Vendredi,</I>
 a journal that, 
in the words of Pascal Ory and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Sirinelli, sought to 
be the "conscience" of the Popular Front by maintaining strict editorial 
independence. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
In 1938, still loyal to the flagging Popular 
Front, Petitjean urged his nation toward revolution "without fascism, 
Hitlerism, or Stalinism, and without the anticommunism of Mister Jacques 
Doriot [of the PPF, or French Popular Party]." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">
25</A>
</SUP>
He also 
criticized the excessive abstraction and formal perfection of right-wing 
nationalist ideology, declaring that Hitler himself was little concerned 
about questions of "indeterminacy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">
26</A>
</SUP>
By this point, his 
private brand of revolutionary national-populism, quite militarist at the 
end of the year, had acquired a resoundingly protofascist ring. 
<p>
Petitjean's nonconformism in the 1930s and his subsequent collaboration 
with Vichy render him quite relevant to current historical analyses of 
French fascism. His writings after 1936 fit well with Zeev Sternhell's 
influential description of left-leaning, nationalist 
antiparliamentarianism as 
<I>ni droite ni gauche</I>
 (neither Right nor 
Left) fascist ideology. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">
27</A>
</SUP>
However, Michel Winock, one of 
Sternhell's most articulate opponents, questions the existence of any 
"coherent" French fascist ideology, since "no political movement was ever 
able consistently to assemble or to unite" under such a 
banner. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">
28</A>
</SUP>
Daniel Lindenberg, on the other hand, is broadly 
sympathetic to Sternhell's approach and tries to establish a fascist 
political continuum from the nonconformist 1930s to Vichy 
collaborationism--a continuum in terms of Vichy's doctrine of National 
Revolution, already proposed in the 1930s by Petitjean and 
others. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">
29</A>
</SUP>
Drawing upon the work of Robert Paxton, Lindenberg 
thus opposes ideological collaborationism to the realpolitik of Vichy 
state politicians who remained anti-German while collaborating with the 
invader. Collaborationism, in this formulation, involved a form of 
visionary fervor or "mental world, characterised by 'an ethic of 
conviction', committed pro-Nazism, a world far from the compromises and 
trickery that [collaborationists] all condemned at 'Vichy'" ("FI," 
155). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">
30</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean can serve here as a prime example. He 
enthusiastically endorsed the Vichy doctrine of National Revolution within 
a German Europe: "The national socialist revolution will proceed in the 
West and will make Europe, or Europe will succumb to foreign enslavement 
in its own anarchy." 
<SUP>

Petitjean's article in the December 
1942 issue of 
<I>Id&eacute;es,</I>
 "Friends of 
<B></B>
 the 
Revolution," which lists prewar opponents of both the Left and the Right, 
sustains Lindenberg's broad claim about the legacy of 1930s nonconformism: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
A collaborationist, therefore, was to be distinguished from a fascist, a 
pacifist, a socialist or an old-style Jacobin republican precisely because 
he believed that, thanks to Franco-German collaboration, he had 
transcended the contradictions and weaknesses inherent to those ideologies 
whose impotence and harmfulness had been demonstrated by the defeat of 
[France in] 1940. ["FI," 140]

<p>
The larger historical debate about French nonconformist fascism can hardly 
stand or fall on such a re as Petitjean, but I would underscore that 
precisely what is distinctive about Petitjean among the ranks of 
nonconformists turned 
<I>collabos</I>
 can shed new light on the bigger 
picture of French fascistic 
<I>(fascisant)</I>
 modernism. Like Sternhell, 
Lindenberg highlights a "profound apocalyptic and eschatological mentality 
to be found amongst those disappointed by the Republic, by radicalism, by 
socialism and by syndicalism"; this shapes their "utopian" views of 
Europe, as well as their "rejection of all forms of hedonism and 
materialism" ("FI," 155). And yet Petitjean, despite his heightened and 
dogmatic rhetoric of 1942 and 1943, seems strikingly immune, on the whole, 
to the then-pervasive obsession with the failures of French society--an 
obsession that marked the French 1930s in general and then devolved to the 
revolutionaries of occupied France. For instance, his introduction to 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires</I>
 declared: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The word that, of the entire French language, took me the longest time to 
pronounce was "decadence." To avoid facing the facts, I sought refuge in 
every available system. In particular, I tried to say that the idea of 
decadence was romantic and anti-French, that it existed for us only as 
literature.

<p>
In 1938, Petitjean's explicit rejection of the 
discourse of decadence, of crisis, was received with raised eyebrows by 
the right-wing fascist sympathizer, Robert Brasillach, since what the 
latter considered to be at stake was the constitution of a fascist force 
among French youth. Reviewing Petitjean's 
<I>Le Moderne et son prochain</I>
 for the "Causerie litt&eacute;raire" (Literary chat) of the 
<I>Action Fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 Brasillach declared: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
[Petitjean] explains to us, and it is true, that fascism 
<I>"is always born from a state of crisis following upon a state of war, when the generation of war has hypnotized, as it were, that of ruin."</I>
 And he 
maintains that nothing of the sort has yet occurred in France because 
there has not yet been a 
<I>"generation of crisis."</I>
 I nonetheless 
suspect that it is on the rise. But let us not quibble about these 
delicate matters.

<p>
Petitjean's resolve to deny a "generation of crisis"--and, indeed, 
"crisis" itself--also distinguished him from the "hypnotized" outlook of 
Drieu la Rochelle, whose own generation had been deeply marked by World 
War I. Their contributions to the first issues of the collaborationist 
<I>Id&eacute;es</I>
 clearly convey this divergence. Drieu's "Sense of 
<B></B>
 the Tragic" (November 1941) attributes the defeatist 
French sense of humiliation to its lack of "tragic 
philosophy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">

</SUP>
Rather than similarly dwelling upon Nietzschean 
tragedy, Petitjean optimistically praises (in the journal's next issue) 
what he terms the shift from "necessary" to "possible" 
revolution.

Moreover, he will assail in September 1942 those 
writers generally viewed as the most prominent exemplars of French fascist 
modernism: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
At times, the consideration of our task may imbue us with vertigo, the 
spectacle of our ruins may paralyze us. How many "fascist temperaments" in 
France, from Drieu to Lucien Rebatet, including C&eacute;line, have known 
the temptation of nihilist despair or gleeful anarchy.

<p>
This 
attitude toward decadence in 1942, to which we will return, also clarifies 
Petitjean's specificity within the French cultural avant-garde before the 
war, where, as the voice of a 
<I>new</I>
 generation, he resolutely 
challenged the omnipresent ghosts of World War I. 
<p>
For Brasillach in 1938, Petitjean was not a fascist but displayed a 
"'prefascist' temperament, broadly analogous to what may have been [the 
temperament] of many young Italians prior to 1922." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">
38</A>
</SUP>
Without 
pursuing this Italian comparison, we could say nevertheless that Petitjean 
stands out during a decade mired in the crisis of liberal democracy, one 
that was expressed by varying junctures of aesthetic and political 
modernism and antimodernism in nonconformist and 
<I>fascisant</I>
 literary 
intellectuals alike. "Gnostic, Nietzschean, Drieu embodies throughout his 
career the very type of the antimodernist modern," writes 
Lindenberg. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">
39</A>
</SUP>
In contrast, Petitjean remains surprisingly 
sanguine. Note the equilibrium he posits in 1938: "the forces of 
re-creation are in close equilibrium with those of creation. . . . The 
powers of man are no longer distant from those of the ancient gods (and of 
course from those of the demons). . . . He can finally look life and 
reality in the face." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">
40</A>
</SUP>
Or, again, consider his calm praise in 
1938 for the themes of the Swiss writer Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz: these 
descriptions of nature and the peasantry are an act of "sacred" 
preservation, without which the world of the future, "that which we are 
rebuilding, would lose its measure and raison d'&ecirc;tre." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">
41</A>
</SUP>
More concretely, he insisted that his generation was exempt from and 
untainted by World War I and, furthermore, that the Third Republic was not 
Weimar. On such grounds, and on the basis of a more recent discovery of 
"the people"
<I> ("le peuple"),</I>
 Petitjean would hence refuse in July 
1938 to heed the siren songs of "French abjection"; in fact, the French 
"people is so happy that it's still unconscious of being 
so." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">

</SUP>
<p>
This outright rejection of a sense of despair suggests how Petitjean's 
nonconformist discourse is unhinged from any socioeconomic or, indeed, 
historical basis to assume the form of a plastic, or infinitely mobile, 
projection. According greatest attention to Petitjean's 
<I>surr&eacute;alisant</I>
 vanguard years, let us follow the early 
theoretical construction and some oddly illuminating intersections--with 
Bachelard, Lacan, Paulhan, among others--of Petitjean's revolutionary 
plasticity. 
<B></B>
<p>
During a decade so fraught with the seeking of Personalist or spiritual 
regeneration, 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">

few writers so performed--not to mention 
theorized--the state of youthful promise as did the lively Petitjean, who 
was appreciated as a bracing blend of avant-garde intellect and 
unrestrained passion. For Gaston Bachelard, in 1936, Petitjean's writing 
revealed "dynamism and experience, poetry and knowledge, that is to say, 
irreconcilable qualities."

Petitjean's earliest work affords a revealing illustration of the relation 
between ideological and intellectual indeterminacy, one that arose largely 
as a reaction against surrealism. Reading Petitjean's wartime text, 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires,</I>
 in 1943, Jean Piel (future editor of 
<I>Critique,</I>
 along with Georges Bataille) would record in his diary: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Here we have the final result of this frenzied naked will, lacking any 
real conviction that might assign it a goal: deformation of so many 
pseudointellectuals before the war, who were reacting against surrealist 
fatalism, and for whom the false reek of Nietzscheanism was awakened by 
the noisy echoes across the Rhine.

<p>
Many on the periphery of surrealism in the 1930s, inspired to achieve a 
synthesis of Marx and Freud and interested in questions of representation, 
superstructure, and affect, responded in various ways (political, poetic, 
aesthetic, scientific, philosophical) to "surrealist fatalism," as Piel 
suggests. This term echoes the opinion, increasingly voiced as political 
anxieties gripped the decade, that surrealism involved an idealist and 
aestheticized pseudoscience of the unconscious mind. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">

<p>
Petitjean's own variant of avant-garde revolution entailed the dialectic 
of what he termed Imagination and Realization, as outlined in his study 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
 This work recast his earlier 
essays on Joyce of 1934-35. A Germanophile and an Anglophile, fluent in 
both German and English, Petitjean was distinctly cosmopolitan in his 
avant-gardism. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">

</SUP>
"He inspired me to reread 
<I>Ulysses,</I>
" 
wrote Brasillach, "that immense challenge to art and to 
nature." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">
50</A>
</SUP>
And yet, Petitjean's undying passion was not for 
<I>Ulysses</I>
 but for the play of language in Joyce's 
<I>Work in Progress,</I>
 or 
<I>Finnegans Wake.</I>
 So enthralled was he that the 
contagion of Joycean prose complicates any access to his ideas, especially 
in his work of the mid-1930s. Benjamin Fondane, a rather mystical Rumanian 
Jewish avant-garde writer who was to die in Auschwitz, exclaimed about 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation:</I>
 "such vast amounts of material 
cited in the original language, English, German, Spanish, Latin, Greek, 
even Sanskrit! not to lead you to suspect just that the author is young 
but that he 
<I>knows</I>
 he is young." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">
51</A>
</SUP>
Fondane was generally 
hostile, though, to what he elsewhere termed the 
<I>"rational appropriation of the irrational"</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">
52</A>
</SUP>
prevalent in French 
surrealizing modernism; hence, he found Petitjean's "manner undoubtedly 
more satisfying than the 
<I>excessive clarity</I>
 of 
Bergson." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">
53</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan, on the other hand, repeatedly enjoined 
Petitjean to re&euml;merge from under the weight of his readings and his 
foreign languages 
<B></B>
 (this ironically echoed in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
) to elucidate his own thoughts. 
<p>
Yet it was largely in response to the surrealist "unconscious" that 
Petitjean had, paradoxically, derived from 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
 a model 
of intellectual lucidity. Joyce's literary aesthetic proposed a form of 
absolute self-consciousness unavailable, or so Petitjean claimed, in the 
French context: "a new meaning, a mythical measure, born out of the 
psychological depths, a veritable 'tempo' of the thought." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">
54</A>
</SUP>
Joyce masters free associations "through what in others . . . would be 
called improper language"; he thus transcends Val&eacute;ry's "supreme 
consciousness" as well as Andr&eacute; Breton's "supreme 
unconsciousness"--toward "hyperconsciousness." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">
55</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean's 
"Joyce and Myth" appeared in Eugene Jolas's English-language Parisian 
journal, 
<I>transition,</I>
 which had single-handedly sustained and 
published Joyce's 
<I>Work in Progress.</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">
56</A>
</SUP>
In 
<I>transition,</I>
 the Jolases yoked together two distinct 
avant-gardes--"the 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
 current" and "the surrealist 
current," in the words of Maria Jolas--which even in this promising 
context had little or no interaction. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">
57</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean's essay of 
1935, "Joyce and Mythology," reflects such a rift--or, rather, pits the 
first current against the second. Although he uses Joyce to assail Bergson 
and Proust--here is no "mythology of the inner world" ("JM," 134) and 
Joyce has not "lost his time" ("JM," 136)--the real enemy is surrealism, 
with its use of the unconscious, automatic writing (which dissociates 
language and thought), objective chance 
<I>("le hasard objectif"),</I>
 and 
"primitive mentality" (Lucien L&eacute;vy-Bruhl's influential category). 
<p>
Joyce's own leftist political views notwithstanding, Petitjean predicates 
on the writer's literary "authenticity" both a nonconformist, 
anti-ideological perspective and a theory of revolution. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">
58</A>
</SUP>
In 
defining Joyce as the only "poet" who might "bring us back through 
mythology to ourselves and the world" ("JM," 135), Petitjean is concerned 
less with language than with ideology. 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
 is the 
demystifying salvation for modernity escaping the "non-sense of history," 
a world where 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
mythology becomes more and more a factor, a desperate counterfactor of 
history: some retreat into the past, others return to it (Giulio Evola, 
Gimenez Caballero, Rosenberg, every fascist), and more than one Marxist 
prophet tries to return to the future; under the pretext of the crisis, 
each one gets off on the wrong foot. All too human mythology where the 
hero himself, the F&uuml;hrer, presents himself gratuitously as Ecce Homo, 
the simple tensor of the more or less political energy of the men that 
[sic] are "his" men! ["JM," 134] 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Petitjean is thus already rejecting "crisis," the "mythology of 
catastrophe, which wants to be, and is, the very motor of history, that of 
Dostoevsky, Georges Sorel, Spengler--earlier that of Choderlos de Laclos" 
("JM," 134). Petitjean had previously mentioned Beckett's reading of Joyce 
that had proposed Vico's 
<I>New Science</I>
 as the structuring principle 
of 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
--here, claims Petitjean, is "the fundamental 
order of things." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">
59</A>
</SUP>
He emphatically contrasted this cycle with 
Nietzsche's "eternal return," which, in Petitjean's opinion, was conceived 
"in its distress rather than 
<B></B>
 its glory, and as a 
vision rather than as a law of nature, only to . . . forestall 
[Nietzsche's] own catastrophe." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">
60</A>
</SUP>
By July 1939, Petitjean 
would transpose Beckett's Joyce into nationalist optimism: "If there is 
one country where Vico is right, it is ours, which finds eternity in the 
very periodicity of its new agings and youths." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">
61</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Before he developed such political applications in the late 1930s, 
however, Petitjean had translated his reading of Joyce into 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">

This study of "realism 
recover[ing] reality by dint of mythology," explored the cycles, or 
"eternal return of the imagination," in a broader philosophical 
sense.

Entirely forgotten today (although worth 
republishing, I believe) this work offers a breathtaking romp through the 
various discourses of the European avant-garde and was received, at least 
by Bachelard and Fondane, with great enthusiasm. I suspect that Lacan also 
took an interest in what converged, in some ways, with his own thoughts on 
the "mirror stage." 
<p>
To help us grasp Petitjean's argument, let us examine a summary he later 
presented in 
<I>Combats Pr&eacute;liminaires,</I>
 in which he claimed a 
continued adherence to the basic terms of 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
 This can aptly serve as the essence of what I have 
called his revolutionary plasticity: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The imagination projects the world for us as a state of nature, as 
absolute; but . . . the different techniques of the will, harnessing an 
ever growing sum of natural forces, animal instincts, human passions and 
motives, permit us to possess this world that we knew at birth only as an 
image and in a way that becomes ever more complete as we realize and 
reconstruct it.

<p>
It was through his work on Joyce that Petitjean had met Paulhan, whose 
<I>Les Fleurs de Tarbes</I>
 (The flowers of Tarbes), which first appeared 
in 1936, would challenge "surrealist fatalism" in the spheres of language 
and rhetoric, claiming that the Romantic avant-garde destroyed the "word" 
to obtain the "idea." Unlike Paulhan, however, and despite his own 
continued celebration of Joyce and persistent attack on surrealism, 
Petitjean did little in 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 to 
analyze the verbal artifact. 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 can 
be seen as a pataphysical 
<I>Finnegans Wake,</I>
 or theoretical stream of 
consciousness in the extreme.

Its sixteen-page index lists 
German, French, and English philosophers, natural and social scientists, 
all of Western literature (except for Wordsworth and Coleridge), and the 
surrealizing avant-garde. Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Kierkegaard, 
Nietzsche, Ludwig Klages (the right-wing philosopher of 
<I>Der Geist als Widersacher der Seele</I>
 [The Intellect as opponent of the soul]) and 
Heidegger are important points of reference. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">
66</A>
</SUP>
<p>
In his review of 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation,</I>
 Fondane 
discerned a significant attack on the dominant French philosophical theory 
of the imagination--namely, Bergson's "fabulating function" 
<I>("fonction fabulatrice"),</I>
 which arises only as a phenomenon secondary to 
"intelligence." "Petitjean restores the flow's proper direction," writes 
Fondane; "Imagination comes first." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">
67</A>
</SUP>
Indeed, Petitjean posits 
an initial state of radical skepticism. Only through "the Imagination, 
that spiritual precipitation of vitality" do we perceive 
reality. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">
68</A>
</SUP>
Such Imagination is then Realized through the "will 
to conversion," 
<B></B>
 an imperative to reconstitute the 
self and the world in terms of the Imagination, as a form of projection 
called "imitation": "Realization is integration, insertion of the 
Imagination onto the plane of reality. It will thus proceed from imitation 
to imitation." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">
69</A>
</SUP>
Drawing upon Klages, Petitjean argues that 
primary imitation--a form of biological imagination, or mimicry--is a 
feature of the natural world, but that imitation in the second 
degree--that is, dialectical Imagination, or self-representation--is an 
activity of which only man is capable. Accordingly, the "will to 
imitation" must be harnessed as a form of dialectical mimicry, as the 
"conversion process" between Imagination and Realization, between the 
imaginary and the real. It is a 
<I>prise de conscience</I>
 predicated on 
"the integration, in turn, of that Imagination that initially integrated 
us." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">
70</A>
</SUP>
<p>
At this point, we locate a second major thrust of Petitjean's argument, 
which, like his earlier Joycean essays, still largely inveighs against the 
surrealist literary aesthetic. Of course, 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 does proffer a more generally anti-ideological 
attack on the "fictionalism" of modernity, the degraded Imagination of 
which is politically and socially exploited, society of the spectacle 
<I>avant la lettre.</I>
 Petitjean seems really more interested, though, in 
how the avant-garde Imagination has run wild--and in this, he pinpoints 
"surrealist fatalism." If we do not master our Imagination in a virile and 
willful dialectic with Realization, he argues, first-degree imitations 
will stand as "
<I>sur- or subreality</I>
 . . . [,] a mockery of this 
reality and of its Imagination." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">
71</A>
</SUP>
Only the "hysteric," an 
epithet Petitjean often applies to surrealism, will take his (or her) 
relatively unself-conscious--or, indeed, unconscious--projections and 
mimetic pantomimes for real. 
<p>
Gaston Bachelard, who sought to revolutionize scientific epistemology in 
1934 with his "new scientific spirit" 
<I>("le nouvel esprit scientifique"),</I>
 was discovering surrealism in the very years in which 
he was becoming the "Master of Break Theory," to quote J. G. Merquior's 
study of Foucault. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">
72</A>
</SUP>
This may explain Bachelard's ecstatic 
response to Petitjean's philosophical style, "unique in the annals of 
philosophy." "Until now the Imagination had not found its metaphysician," 
he writes. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">
73</A>
</SUP>
These "programs of psychical realization[,] . . . 
 which we will henceforth have to call 'Petitjeanian gyrations' 
<I>[' les retournements petitjeaniens']</I>," convey "the true dynamics of the 
psyche." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">
74</A>
</SUP>
For this philosopher of science, such epistemic 
ruptures also revealed the imaginative dimension, or "breaks," within 
biology and natural evolution itself. "Life, just like thought, jumps from 
one image to another," Bachelard intones under the spell of Petitjean's 
lyrical prose. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">
75</A>
</SUP>
<p>
I would also correlate 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 with that 
great monument to surrealizing phenomenological skepticism, Lacan's 
Imaginary, which, like Petitjean's conceptual framework, arose through and 
against surrealist "hysteria." Lacan's early work, as is well known, 
reflected a dialogue with Salvador Dali, whose own theory of "critical 
paranoia," of strategic obsession, purported to endow surrealism with a 
more powerful and active grasp of imagination than did its prior 
techniques, such as automatic writing. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">

</SUP>
<p>
To establish a specific biographical connection, I would note that in 
October 
<B></B>
 1941, Paulhan will write to Petitjean, 
"Lacan is very eager to see you. Could you please give him a call before 
you leave." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">
77</A>
</SUP>
Three years earlier, reviewing the 
<I>Mental Life</I>
 volume of the 1938 
<I>Encyclop&eacute;die fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
Petitjean had himself evoked Lacan's "remarkable" article on the 
family--which included a section on the mirror stage--to praise this new 
psychology that "integrates the world in man by relating him to his own 
knowledge of the world and to what he mistook, until now, for 'objectivity.'" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">

</SUP>
Their relation may even date back to 1935, 
when Petitjean published an essay in 
<I>Minotaure</I>
 linked to 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
--an essay he called "Analyse 
spectrale du singe" (Spectral analysis of the monkey). This appeared 
printed next to Caillois's "Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia," which 
Lacan enthusiastically mentions in his postwar, 
post-
<I>&eacute;puration</I>
 essay, "The Mirror Stage as Formative of the 
Function of the I" of 1949. Petitjean's essay, like Lacan's, compares 
monkey and man and their relation to mirrors.

<I>["singer"]</I>
 unites mimicry 
and ape

)--we learn that we are not the acme of evolution:

[Since] the monkey does not recognize itself in the mirror, since if it 
did it would immediately be metamorphosed into man, which is exactly the

a laughing monkey.

Like Petitjean, Lacan cites "a real 
<I>specific prematurity of birth</I>
 in man" that conditions the desire 
for self-mastery through his specular image; this 
<I>mirror stage</I>
 will 
hence definitively situate "the agency of the ego . . . in a fictional 
direction." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">
82</A>
</SUP>
For Lacan, this process is "jubilant" ("MS," 2). 
For Petitjean, in 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation,</I>
 on the 
contrary, such relations to the gestalt may be "imaginary, forced, and 
desperate"--and Petitjean aspires, as we have seen, to a dialectical 
resolution of Imagination and Realization. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">

It is intriguing 
to consider Lacan's 
<I>"function of m&eacute;connaissance"</I>
 ("MS," 6), 
derived from man's unique "organic insufficiency in his natural reality" 
("MS," 4) as a radical counterpoint to the voluntarist "eternal return of 
the imagination." 
<p>
After 1936, claiming allegiance to the Popular Front, Petitjean will take 
Imagination and Realization to "the people," to National Revolution, and, 
ultimately, to war. I mean to emphasize two things about this period of 
extreme intellectual complexity, during which Petitjean himself addressed 
a vast array of topics for 
<I>Vendredi.</I>
 First, as I mentioned 
previously, Petitjean, while remaining a nonconformist of the Left, moved 
increasingly toward right-wing nationalism. Second, Petitjean's veritable 
target, that is, the sole clear enemy of his revolutionary consciousness 
(which collapsed all distinction between the political and the aesthetic), 
remained the French avant-garde; 
<B></B>
 this will bring us 
back to our point of departure, the College of Sociology. 
<p>
Let us, then, briefly trace, without engaging the ideological chaos of 
these years, Petitjean's trajectory from leftist revolutionary Jacobinism 
to a more nationalist revolutionary populism, which he associated, in 
1938, with the great Dreyfusard, Charles P&eacute;guy. In the heyday of 
L&eacute;on Blum's government (1936-37), Petitjean's hopes ran high: 
revolution was compatible with negotiation. Against all odds, in early 
1938, he still favored the indeterminate Popular Front, "a political 
formation that our 'nationalists' abhor," whereby "slowly but surely," 
nevertheless, "with the same 'disorder' as that of the bourgeoisie during 
the French Revolution, the people of France is becoming 
nationalized." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">
84</A>
</SUP>
After Germany's 
<I>Anschluss</I>
 of Austria 
in March 1938, however, he adopted a posture of nationalistic 
belligerence. All the same, this did not diminish his Germanophilia and 
his chivalric esteem for the enemy. In April 1938, we find him praising 
the aristocratic German army, which "miraculously" survived the 
humiliating Treaty of Versailles and which "despite all the temptations of 
its strength, 
<I>was able to await Hitler.</I>
" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">
85</A>
</SUP>
In fact, 
Petitjean himself even sounds moved by the rise of Hitler: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
This man from the south, whose primary experience was Viennese, and who 
could witness how racial diversity, excessive speculation, and 
intellectual sophistication may threaten a great empire such as that of 
the Hapsburgs, came to return all of its people to Prussian rule, has 
armed the Reichswehr itself with an ideology more fearsome than any that 
motivated the last war. . . . As for the end result, I expect we shall see 
it soon. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">

To his own pacifist country, Petitjean did not 
recommend socioeconomic change but articulated instead an agressive 
doctrine in which political (that is, governmental), social (that is, 
demographic), and cultural (that is, aesthetic) senses of "representation" 
were indissociable: "No 'people' is as poorly represented by their 
politics, literature, or by their capital as the French." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">
87</A>
</SUP>
This called for re-representation of the people on a grand, national 
scale. On the one hand, he endorsed a literary aesthetic, an ethics, and a 
politics of nationalist "reorientation" 
<I>("repaysement").</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">

</SUP>
In more militaristic terms, he 
called for "the dictatorship of France over all Frenchmen." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">

</SUP>
Petitjean would ground this protofascist ideology in the 
<I>"mystique"</I>
of P&eacute;guy, whose ambiguous intellectual legacy bridges Catholicism, 
socialism, and nationalism: "P&eacute;guy is coming back," he wrote in 
December 1938.

<p>
Petitjean's ideological indeterminacy is matched, if not conditioned, by 
the conceptual indeterminacy of Imagination and Realization as these terms 
are applied to the political sphere. 
<I>Le Moderne et son prochain</I>
describes how modern man is intellectually and emotionally "mobilized," or 
exploited, by liberalism, communism, and foreign forms of fascism. Russia, 
for instance, seems pragmatically nationalist, if paradoxically so. 
Unwittingly modernist in its very antimodernism, on the other hand, 
Germany's hypertrophied Imagination, or "integral Romanticism," is on the 
point of dangerous Realization. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">

</SUP>
But worse than all the rest 
is liberal modernity's "concerted lack of consciousness." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">

</SUP>
<B></B>
<p>
In these more local quarrels of the mind, Petitjean assumes a curious 
stance, since 
<I>repaysement</I>
 hardly dictates his nonconformist tastes; 
indeed, humor, for example, "allows the move from action to 
reflection." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">

</SUP>
Most importantly, he is still on the Left. He 
advises the professorial author of 
<I>La Naus&eacute;e</I>
 (Nausea) "to 
open himself up to life, to immerse himself in the world, to harmonize 
Imagination with Realization."

(On 18 August 1938, Paulhan

Chronicling Malraux's antifascist engagement in the Spanish Civil War, the 
novel 
<I>L'Espoir</I>
 (Hope) offers, in Petitjean's estimation, the 
perfect antidote to Sartre: Malraux is "the first in France, since the 
upheavals of the last war, who enters voluntarily--consciously--into the 
history of the twentieth century." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">

Indeed, Petitjean has not 
even fully withdrawn from the avant-garde. In 1938, for example, he is 
planning to write 
<I>L'Oeil,</I>
 the first interdisciplinary study of the 
eye. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">

pure." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">

</SUP>
Petitjean's cosmopolitan sensibility has simply 
become nationalist as well. 
<p>
In effect, Petitjean's ideological and cultural ambiguities resolve 
themselves into a t with the surrealizing avant-garde he knows best. 
The "hysteria" of liberal modernity may well seem embodied in 
surrealism. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">

By 1938, however, "the surrealist movement is no

The real dangers for politicized 
consciousness now lie in C&eacute;line's lyrical right-wing anarchism and 
in the internationalist nonconformism of the experimental College of 
Sociology. If Petitjean's review of L'&Eacute;cole des cadavres (School 
for corpses) assails C&eacute;line as "spokesman for all that is 
spineless, cowardly, abandoned, catastrophic, Cassandresque, and 
treacherous in the country,"

Petitjean thereby underscores 
the revelatory but false consciousness such modernist prose may extend to 
its readers: 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
This language that is thought, that is not even purified by speech, these 
insults that are much more blasphemous, activist, and quasi-incantatory 
than Homeric invectives, due to the fact that they are no longer 
pronounced but written, do not reflect any reality (even verbal reality) 
or any jargon at all. Rather, they express the latent thoughts of 
thousands, of tens, of hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen.

<p>
In mimetic tension, Petitjean's violent diatribe against C&eacute;line 
recovers the Joycean prose of 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
<p>
This very same month, December 1938, Petitjean published a confusing piece 
in the 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise</I>
 almost as virulent as his 
attack on C&eacute;line. In "Fascisme anti-fasciste" (Antifascist 
fascism), he raged against unnamed French "intellectuals without calling," 
"left-wing conservatives," whose absurd slogan was "
<I>Antifascist fascism!</I>
" and who had "recourse to foreign stimulants." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">

</SUP>
Drawn to the "rhythms" of Hitler and Mussolini, these res dissociate 
themselves, nevertheless, from German and Italian nationalism out of 
self-interest. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">
104</A>
</SUP>
Worst of all, however, they constantly 
<B></B>
 attack France itself. "Antifascist fascists" do not 
realize that "the great French revolutions did not occur in a state of 
dearth but involved, on the contrary, an overabundance of heart. They are 
revelation much more than transformation." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">
105</A>
</SUP>
<p>
And just who were these "antifascist fascists?" Here we return to the 
political ambiguities of the antiparliamentarian College of Sociology, to 
Bataille and Caillois, who generally shared Petitjean's belief that 
"contemporary history . . . involves psychology rather than 
economics." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">
106</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan's correspondence with Petitjean, 
however, reveals the latter's deep conflict with the interdisciplinary 
College, which, along with Petitjean (and others), had criticized the 
Munich Accords in the November 1938 issue of 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise.</I>
 Nonetheless, as the "Declaration," drafted by 
Caillois, made perfectly clear, the antipacifist College of Sociology was 
also firmly antinationalist out of leftist, internationalist conviction; 
moreover, it envisioned a much more radical revolutionary strategy, one 
which could take shape after discussions and research. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">
107</A>
</SUP>
Briefly put, and reflecting its own emergence against "surrealist 
fatalism," the College envisioned the resurrection of a loosely 
Durkheimian "sacred" that would recast "society" as "community" through 
sociological rather than patriotic or nationalist 
<I>prise de conscience</I>. 
<p>
In January 1939, after the publication of "Fascisme anti-fasciste," 
Paulhan proposed that Petitjean and the College resolve their internecine 
warring. As Paulhan would have it, the College of Sociology would cease 
rejecting any specific attention to France, and Petitjean, in turn, would 
stop singing the praises of France. "Is there not some institution, some 
social form, that might replace it, that through its very presence might 
provide . . . the broad outline of such praise?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF108" HREF="#FOOT108">

</SUP>
By the very 
next month, Petitjean had launched a new journal for his generation, 
<I>Les Nouveaux Cahiers de la quinzaine,</I>
 the descriptive announcements 
of which suggest a Nationalist Revolutionary College of Sociology--"an 
Institution," declared Paulhan.

 Invoking P&eacute;guy and

<I>Les Nouveaux Cahiers de la quinzaine</I>

<A NAME="REF110" HREF="#FOOT110">

Compared to the 
conflictual and ambiguous College of Sociology, Petitjean's project seems 
a model of revolutionary plasticity, insofar as it explicitly aimed to 
reconcile dogma with ideological pluralism, theory with praxis, revolution 
with status quo, religion with materialism, mystical patriotism with 
social science, state with family (among other collectives), and the 
imaginary with the real. Discussion topics were to include "family, jobs, 
cult of the dead, army, youth groups, theater, spiritual authorities, 
intermediaries, representatives, managers, French regions, North Africa, 
French propaganda, foreigners in France."

It

concurrent discussion of the family in the

Alas, 
given the onset of the war, Petitjean's envisioned journal became instead 
the single-issue military journal

recruits.

As I noted at the outset, the members of the College of Sociology did not

Bearing in mind Petitjean's strong Germanophilia and sympathies for 
right-wing nationalism, can we predict the divergent paths these 
nonconformists were to take in any other way? I would tentatively suggest 
that the revolutionary intellectuals of the College of Sociology, 
generally older (except for Caillois), were both more radically visionary 
and more rigorous and principled than Petitjean, each in his own way. The 
"community" of the College thus floundered on the contradictions, both 
collective and private, that informed its members' responses to a deep 
sense of historical crisis. We might wish to consider, as well, the rather 
scientistic dimension of French modernism that inspired the College of 
Sociology--the "rational appropriation of the irrational," to recall 
Fondane's remark, however paradoxical or subverted--as opposed both to 
Petitjean's eccentric reading of Joyce and to his absorption of 
<I>Lebensphilosophie.</I>
 In any event, applauding the 
<I>Courrier</I>
several months later, Paulhan queried Petitjean nonetheless, "Once again, 
<I>what is it</I>
 that you want?"

In February 1940, Drieu la Rochelle wrote quite poignantly about Petitjean 
in his diary: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
He seems already quite struck and frightened by the disintegration that he

sense of despair. Poor boy. More terribly than I will he come to know the

<p>
But Petitjean bounced back despite his wounded hand, the fall of France, 
and his disaffection from "the people." In September 1941, Paulhan, whose 
own intricate interactions with both collaboration and the Resistance have 
not yet been fully chronicled, wrote to Drieu about Petitjean. He was 
clearly surprised by Petitjean's easy move to the Vichy ministry of 
information: "Yes, the case of Petitjean is striking 
<B></B>
 and (most likely) tragic. Can one bring about revolution as a minister? . . . I don't know. I don't think so. . . . It means having great faith in 
the power of lies, in one's own ability to lie." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF122" HREF="#FOOT122">
122</A>
</SUP>
<p>
I will not survey at this point the continuity of youth movements between 
the Popular Front and Vichy, Petitjean's maneuvering throughout a period 
of political flux, his numerous articles in 
<I>Id&eacute;es: Journal de la R&eacute;volution Nationale</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF123" HREF="#FOOT123">
123</A>
</SUP>
and the 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 or his endorsement of French "imperial 
consciousness" toward North Africa ("Without the Empire, all hope is 
lost"). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF124" HREF="#FOOT124">
124</A>
</SUP>
Most important, I think, is the basic shift in 
Petitjean's dialectic of Imagination and Realization, which during the 
Occupation is now conducted in dialogue with Vichy and the Third Reich 
rather than with the French avant-garde. After the fall of France, 
Petitjean no longer argues that his country need merely acknowledge its 
own strength. His particular form of fascist modernism generally shuns 
both the "rose-colored glasses" of P&eacute;tain's National Revolution as 
well as the "dark glasses" of collaborationists and others who reiterate 
the discourse of national crisis, namely that France should engage in 
National Revolution under the German aegis since the defeat confirmed its 
failure as a society. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF125" HREF="#FOOT125">
125</A>
</SUP>
In Petitjean's opinion, the most 
objective analysis of French socioeconomic collapse has been provided by 
German strategists themselves ("IF," 11-14). Yet an equally objective 
remedy for such problems is to revitalize French motivation and will by 
focusing on France's "true status in the world . . . as the avant-garde of 
human civilization." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF126" HREF="#FOOT126">
126</A>
</SUP>
<p>
If the Jacobin tradition placed France at the revolutionary forefront of 
Europe, Petitjean's essay "Principles of a Western Order"  also 
suggests, nonetheless, that German power should now inspire French 
revolutionary consciousness. Before the war, as we have seen, Petitjean 
viewed the problem of European modernity as that of an excessive, 
exploited, or unbridled Imagination. Thus, for example, Weimar was infused 
by dangerous, compensatory Romanticism. At present, in contrast, the 
problem (if it can be called that) is not modernity as weakened by myth 
but, instead, as gloriously bolstered by technology--that is, by excessive 
(or German) Realization. "The wealth, strength, and science of Western man 
evolve more quickly than does his consciousness," writes 
Petitjean. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF127" HREF="#FOOT127">
127</A>
</SUP>
This creates an imbalance between Imagination and 
Realization that triggers revolution. In the twentieth century, in other 
words, this disjunction has given rise to ideological Western 
revolutionaries, both Nazis and Bolsheviks, who "more secure in their 
traditions and more conscious of the future than the masses, have always 
strengthened and extended the masses' social structure and national 
horizon while restoring their sense of sacred honors."

Such 
<I>prise de conscience</I>
 defined as elite utopian 
<I>doxa</I>
 seems 
tailor-made for the former nonconformists turned National Revolutionary 
propagandists in occupied France! 
<p>
After the war, and having been blacklisted by the CNE, Petitjean appraised 
his postwar ordeals in 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 , which Daniel 
Lindenberg considers today an unjustly neglected and rare "auto-critique" 
of the time. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF129" HREF="#FOOT129">

</SUP>
This historian likes what he 
<B></B>
 calls Petitjean's "desacralization" of writers and intellectuals 
whom, he claims, Paulhan tends on the contrary to "sacralize" and thus to 
exonerate in 
<I>De la paille et du grain.</I>
 Here, explains Lindenberg, 
lies "the true motive of [Paulhan's] practice, which consists of shielding 
[collaborationist writers] from any criticism." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF130" HREF="#FOOT130">
130</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan's 
defense of Petitjean and others from the CNE--of which he himself was a 
founding member--does indeed turn, in part, on the doctrine of the 
writer's "right to error." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF131" HREF="#FOOT131">
131</A>
</SUP>
<p>
A closer look at 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 should help to illuminate 
these issues. First, when read closely, Petitjean's "unveiling" is nothing 
if not a self-exoneration. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF132" HREF="#FOOT132">
132</A>
</SUP>
Second, it glorifies Petitjean's 
status as a writer. Again, he positions himself above and beyond the 
ideological fray: "[this ter] has made too many mistakes, he has 
witnessed too many fully to adopt any one dogma." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF133" HREF="#FOOT133">
133</A>
</SUP>
Assailing 
the orthodoxies of 
<I>"gendlettres,"</I>
 (the intellectual avant-garde, 
that is, the CNE), Petitjean poses as a religious, universalizing moralist 
who may clarify the confused minds of his compatriots--"Divided 
<I>between</I>
 or 
<I>within</I>
 themselves?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF134" HREF="#FOOT134">
134</A>
</SUP>
Unlike himself, 
they have not fully grasped the experience of the war. 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 thus questions countless postwar ideological and moral oppositions 
and seeks to remedy, in particular, the unhinged identity of the French 
<I>"patrie"</I>
 (fatherland). Petitjean decries, for example, "the case of 
the internationalist sharpshooter [member of the Communist Resistance], 
who will t for his country only insofar as he deems it in accord with 
his political ideal." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF135" HREF="#FOOT135">

Both Paulhan and Petitjean thus defined themselves in these years as 
nonconformists, as opposed to the Communist-dominated CNE, which wore the 
mantle of the national Resistance--yet Paulhan's defense of Petitjean in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 can be read as a study in comparative 
nonconformisms. During the war, Paulhan remained loyal to Petitjean while 
consistently pointing out the logical and ethical contradictions of his 
behavior in a fascinating series of letters; his allusions to Petitjean in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 are also ambivalent in the extreme. Most 
seriously, Paulhan remarks of 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 that "[it] 
decides issues, instead of sorting them out." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF136" HREF="#FOOT136">
136</A>
</SUP>
This, of 
course, is precisely what 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 attacks in the 
"fascist adjudications" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF137" HREF="#FOOT137">
137</A>
</SUP>
of the CNE and is precisely what 
Paulhan seeks to oppose through his complex analyses of the "mysteries" 
inherent in patriotism and language. On the first crucial topic, for 
example, he counters Petitjean's lament that France was defended by 
Communists who foreswore the "fatherland" 
<I>("la patrie")</I>
 as an 
ideal. France was brilliantly betrayed, Paulhan replies, but it was 
betrayed by the very nationalists who worshipped it as such. In these 
confusions, Petitjean, the CNE, and others are 
<I>equally</I>
enmeshed. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF138" HREF="#FOOT138">
138</A>
</SUP>
<p>
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 targets Petitjean in particular, however, 
by summoning his tendency to use untranslated foreign words. Despite 
Paulhan's ironic intimations of the relation of multilingualism and 
collaborationism, his line of thought is hardly so reductive; rather, it 
recalls Petitjean's reading of Joyce and the question of literary 
lucidity. For Paulhan, the question becomes, how well does a writer master 
the mysterious play of his own language, of a foreign language--or, more 
generally--of what he is writing? 
<B></B>
<p>
At this point, 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 cites Petitjean's use of 
the Kierkegaardian term 
<I>einkelte</I>
 (the individual) with seemingly 
gratuitous aim. If we return to 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu,</I>
 however, we 
realize that Petitjean had vigorously condemned in this singular re, 
"[one] who takes himself tragically, who finds himself suddenly before God 
without any self-awareness." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF139" HREF="#FOOT139">
139</A>
</SUP>
In a sense, Kierkegaard's 
<I>einkelte</I>
 is made to serve as an antithesis to Petitjean's own 
moralizing stance. Yet, Paulhan writes of the 
<I>einkelte,</I>
 "once it 
has gone astray in a French text, [it] is no longer simply the solitary. 
It is the solitary with some kind of advantageous nuance (which remains 
Petitjean's secret)--as if it were very serious to be 
solitary!" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF140" HREF="#FOOT140">
140</A>
</SUP>
The secretive, "advantageous" opacity that 
Paulhan attributes to Petitjean's 
<I>einkelte</I>
 becomes deeply ironic, 
since it reverses the 
<I>einkelte</I>'s stated status in 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
--and thus implicitly impugns the writer's own relation to 
self-consciousness and conscience. More than mere hypocrisy, linguistic, 
or intellectual error, or uncharted semantic excess, it is rather a form 
of unintentional inauthenticity that Paulhan seems to reveal. In other 
words, any writer may make mistakes, in either his own or in a foreign 
language, but some writers are completely blind to what they write. 
<p>
Living conduit that he is between the 
<I>ni droite ni gauche</I>
 1930s, 
the Phony War, Vichy, the 
<I>&eacute;puration,</I>
 and ecology trends of 
the 1970s and 1980s, Petitjean reveals a remarkable plasticity. On one 
level, he returns to the right-wing biological metaphysics of his youth, 
although now shorn of its Nietzschean voluntarism. On another level, he 
returns to the politically nonconformist Left; despite man's encounter 
with the limits of nature, Petitjean still believes in utopias. In the 
wake of May 1968, he thus asserts: "the global vision of a just world must 
arise in our hearts." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF141" HREF="#FOOT141">
141</A>
</SUP>
In 1989, he recommends that the 
experimental "biosphere" avoid "all ideological 
infiltration." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF142" HREF="#FOOT142">
142</A>
</SUP>
He assails egocentrism, anthropocentrism, 
Eurocentrism, and tempers the strain of the world's demise with all the 
fervor of a revolutionary Deep Ecologist: Man must acknowledge "alterity 
within himself, in all beings, within Nature itself." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF143" HREF="#FOOT143">
143</A>
</SUP>
If 
Petitjean's career thus tends to evoke the fascistic resonance of Deep 
Ecology as described, for example, by Luc Ferry in 
<I>Le Nouvel ordre &eacute;cologique</I>
 (The new ecological order), 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF144" HREF="#FOOT144">

even more

Il nous explique, et cela est juste, que le fascisme "est n&eacute; 
partout de la succession d'un &eacute;tat de crise &agrave; un &eacute;tat 
de guerre, quand la g&eacute;n&eacute;ration du feu a pour ainsi dire

comun n'a pu encore se produire en France, parce qu'il n'y a pas encore eu 
de "g&eacute;n&eacute;ration de la crise". Il me semble pourtant qu'elle 
commence &agrave; monter. Mais ne discutons m&ecirc;me pas sur ces points

linguistic experiments of Mr. Joyce. He pays tribute to the master more 
effectively in his manner than in his matter. . . . His dismissal of D. H. 
Lawrence and Sherwood Anderson has point; but his remark regarding Mr. 
Pound that 'American imagism has become no more than a kind of poetical 
atomism' is a fairer sample of how he has sought to make his too many 
verdicts more terse than arresting. He may be said to coruscate, not to 
burn with any devouring flame" (M. B., review of

<I>Id&eacute;es,</I>
 targeting an audience of educated youth, had little

premise of Deep Ecology, which, according to Ferry, displaces the Social 
Contract with a Natural Contract, whereby "the entire universe becomes the 
subject of rights: it is no longer man, viewed as the center of the world, 
who must be first and foremost protected against himself, but it is now 
rather the 
<I>cosmos</I>
 as such which must be protected against man" 
("l'univers tout entier deviendrait sujet de droit: ce n'est plus l'homme, 
consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme centre du monde, qu'il faut au premier chef

<p>
 It might be suggested, though, that Petitjean disproves Ferry's claim 
that "ecology . . . is the first revolutionary political movement . . . 
that is entirely opposed to utopias" ("l'&eacute;cologie semble &ecirc;tre 
le premier mouvement politique r&eacute;volutionnaire qui . . . soit en 
tout point hostile aux utopies" [138]).

Soon, the twentieth century will be put into a museum. Its curators will 
face 
many difficult tasks: how to arrange its galleries and exhibits, and where 
to put 
the horror of Nazism? In one scenario, the museum might be dominated by a 
long 
corridor, a spatial counterpart to a time line, with the central gallery 
culminating in a triumphant display of democratic political systems, 
market-oriented economies, and thoroughly global communications, a display 
whose 
artifacts might include the "Good War," the Internet, and the Kronos 
Quartet. 
Approaching these objects through the central gallery, one would pass a 
series of 
other corridors diverging to the left and the right, corridors housing 
shrill 
political manifestos, uniformed youth brigades, and pale-colored ration 
cards, 
all recalling the once confident enemies of liberalism: the communists, the 
fascists, the Nazis, and other political "utopians." The central gallery 
would 
serve as a reliable moral compass, celebrating the righteousness of the 
West 
(France, the United States, and Great Britain), drawing attention to the 
once 
wayward East (Germany and Russia). The defining event of the century would 
be 
World War II, one that put in proper place and perspective the entire 
century. 
National Socialism, in particular, would provide a frightening, 
anachronistic 
contrast to the political liberty and social emancipation that Europe has 
achieved in the last decades. Yet such a marvelous museum might well be too 
perfect. Outside, the furies of nationalism, the prospect of wholesale 
ecological 
degradation, and persistent economic fears would continue to assault the 
certainties on display inside. 

<p>
Alternatively, to acknowledge the indeterminate aspects of our own fin de 
si&egrave;cle, the gallery could be laid out less strictly, less 
confidently. 
Instead of a central gallery with diverging corridors to regulate the flow 
of 
impressions, the building would house a shifting conration of clusters 
and 
nodes, and exhibits from the same decade might be widely scattered and 
juxtaposed 
with apparently alien materials. The artifacts would be assembled not to 
reveal 
the twentieth century's progressive advance, but to trace and dramatize its 
curious collaborations, the collusions that made the century possible: the 
different histories that it drew upon, the glorious nostalgias that it 
fashioned, 
and the various futures that it imagined. Whereas the first museum would 
house 
the displays of liberal modernization, celebrating the enhanced ability of 
individuals to mobilize resources in the context of a highly differentiated 
capitalist economy and an open political democracy, the second would chart 
the 
genealogies of modernism, tracing the different ways that people and 
institutions 
have tinkered to make themselves secure in the dangerous zones of a 
constantly 
changing world. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">

Obviously, Nazism has a claim for inclusion 
in such 
a retrospective exhibition because it provided one, albeit extreme, answer 
to the 
economic and political crises of post-World War I Germany. Its claim is 
compelling not because National Socialism bears resemblance to the modern 
democracies of the period after World War II, or because it adopted and 
celebrated automobiles, airplanes, and other futuristic technology, but 
because 
it conceived of Germany as both the object of the social and economic 
forces of 
industrialization and, thanks to those same forces, as a potential subject 
that 
possessed the capacity to reorganize political life and prosper amid 
dangerous 
conditions. The Nazis were modernists because they made the acknowledgment 
of the 
radical instability of twentieth-century life the premise of relentless 
experimentation. 
<p>
For most historians, Nazism has been regarded as the improbable outcome of 
disastrous political and economic conditions. Germany's precipitous 
military 
defeat in 1918, the near civil-war conditions that followed the 
revolution, the 
hyperinflation of 1922 and 1923, the long-winded recession in the 
mid-1920s, and 
finally the devastation of the Great Depression all added up to a 
worst-case 
scenario in which the rise of Hitler becomes comprehensible. Almost any 
textbook 
on the Weimar Republic will take readers through this house of horrors and 
lead 
them straight to the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. (Indeed, Nazis 
and 
neo-Nazis are routinely regarded as the most reliable register of the 
troubles of 
both the first and the second German republics; Nazism, seen in this way, 
stands 
for system failures of one sort or another.) Once in power, the National 
Socialist regime gained the acquiescence of the majority of the German 
people, 
but never enjoyed outright support. Faced with the costs of developing an 
incipient consumer-oriented economy, it chose instead to engage in 
increasingly 
spectacular and dangerous foreign policies to distract the public. For most 
Germans, the Nazi leaders were experienced as bosses and pashas of varying 
degrees of corruption. While the regime's most important ideological 
goals--the 
elimination of the Jews from German life and the subjugation of eastern 
<B></B>
 Europe--were pursued consistently, they were also 
pursued without popular 
consent. The combination of day-to-day venality and less discernable 
ideological 
scheming has encouraged historians to make distinctions between the 
"Nazis" and 
the "Germans," collective nouns whose overlap is never denied, but whose 
juxtaposition suggests mutual exclusion rather than degrees of 
equivalence. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">
2</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Against the grain of conventional historiography, two kinds of arguments 
have 
been advanced that attempt to trace the traffic between National Socialism 
and 
modernity. Over thirty years ago, Ralf Dahrendorf and David Schoenbaum 
maintained 
that the Nazis must be seen as modernizers, who, willfully or not, made 
Germany 
significantly more modern in outlook and laid the foundations for the 
Federal 
Republic 
<I>(Bundesrepublik)</I>
 that would follow. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
Yet this 
well-known argument, which continues to be elaborated (and furiously 
countered), 
unduly restricts the notion of the modern to terms derived from the 
consumer 
economies of the post-World War II period; it slights the specific 
character of 
the Nazi exchange with modernity and forces it into a mold that was made 
much 
later, a 
<I>bundesrepublikanisch</I>
 mold. A more sophisticated approach 
has been 
developed by Detlev Peukert and Zygmunt Bauman, but has received less 
attention 
from historians. It eschews the Federal Republic as a model for assessing 
Nazism 
and instead examines the degree to which Nazism was invested in the 
renovative or 
therapeutic traditions of western civilization. These arguments are not 
without 
their own problems, some of which I shall explain more fully below, but 
they 
offer grounds for further development. In the first set of arguments, 
Nazis are 
claimed to be simply modernizers; in the second, they are, even if only 
potentially, modernists. 
<p>
Accounts that emphasize the modernizing nature of the Nazi regime entail 
that we 
reject the notion that Nazism was simply reactionary, merely defensive, or 
altogether unlikely, a spectacular creature unique to the tumultuous 
interwar 
years. At the same time, too much in the way of historical specificity is 
lost if 
we consider the Hitler regime as solely a developmental dictatorship, a 
mere 
stepping-stone to the more thoroughgoing modernization of the Federal 
Republic. 
Such a view places too much weight on the unintended consequences of Nazi 
politics and too much emphasis on the explicit contents of specific social 
policies. Furthermore, it can also lead, and in fact unfortunately has 
led, to a 
"mainstreaming" of the National Socialists, turning them into 
first-generation 
progressives and effectively consigning their racism more and more to the 
margins. Finally, the concept of modernization is too normative, 
encouraging 
observers to look at the past in terms of the present. The notion of 
modernism, 
in contrast, offers a more open-ended way of mapping the initiatives, 
blueprints, 
and experiments by which contemporaries tried to build lasting, possibly 
illiberal structures in the circumstances of radical instability. It 
requires 
that we focus less on unintended consequences, more on underemphasized 
premises, 
and that we view National Socialism as a distinctive, horrifying, but 
nonetheless 
plausible version of social renovation. That is not easy, for it makes the 
Nazis 
much more familiar, much more like us; it undermines cherished notions of 
how 
different "they" 
<B></B>
 are from "us" or "we" are from 
"them," eroding the 
congenial assumption that modernizers leave racism behind as 
anachronistic. It 
suggests that we might have to consider the Nazis a genuinely popular 
political 
force, rather than merely a symptom of system failure. And if the Nazis are 
regarded as modernists and tinkerers who built a racial utopia in 
accordance with 
the scientific spirit, then the enlightenment tradition looks much more 
strange 
and ambiguous, a strangeness that insinuates itself into our own 
surroundings. 
Much, in fact, is at stake in this debate. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>The Third Reich as Prehistory to the Federal Republic</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
According to Ralf Dahrendorf and David Schoenbaum, the Nazis accelerated 
the 
transformation of Germany into a modern, highly differentiated industrial 
economy 
by mobilizing vast resources in pursuit of their political goals. Their 
aim was 
not the creation of a liberal republic; yet they fashioned its foundations 
by 
mobilizing citizens in an increasingly totalitarian manner, so destroying 
the 
basis of traditional authoritarian institutions such as the Prussian 
state, the 
military, and the aristocracy; eroding exclusive allegiances to political 
and 
cultural subgroups, such as socialists and Catholics; and weakening the 
hold of 
parochial structures, such as the family. In a precise turn of phrase, Axel 
Schildt summarizes Dahrendorf's argument: "Once there had been a 
<I>' Volksgenossen'</I>
 [people's comrade] there could be no return of the 
<I>'Untertan'</I>
 [traditional subject]." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">
4</A>
</SUP>
In other words, 
national 
mobilization forever foreclosed the authoritarian subject. After twelve 
years of 
the Third Reich, including six difficult war years, Germans increasingly 
interacted as individuals rather than social types, and lived according to 
the 
standards of a mobile, achievement-oriented consumer society, rather than 
by the 
customs and habits of enclosed social milieus. 
<p>
Even if, on David Schoenbaum's closer examination, the Nazis did not 
effectively 
break down social barriers and class divisions, as Dahrendorf had claimed, 
the 
regime profoundly reshaped the way people thought about themselves, and 
thus 
anticipated in the realm of attitude and expectation the more consequential 
transformations of the 1950s. For both Dahrendorf and Schoenbaum, however, 
modernization during the Third Reich was not a willful project, but an 
unintended 
consequence of the drastic mobilization in the name of antimodern, "blood 
and 
soil" dreams. The war, more than anything else, uprooted the "nation of 
provincials," laying the foundations for the much more homogeneous and 
mobile 
society of the postwar years. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">
5</A>
</SUP>
This functional reading of 
twentieth-century change assigns to the Nazis leading roles as 
modernizers, even 
though the Nazis themselves, despite the continuities that span the year 
1945, 
have long been seen as complete strangers to the consumer society of the 
Federal 
Republic. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The modernization that earlier scholars had regarded as unintentional, a 
younger 
generation of historians now insists was a central component of Nazi 
ideology. 
Rainer Zitelmann and Michael Prinz, in particular, have argued that Hitler 
and 
the Nazi 
<B></B>
 elite actively sought to fashion a more 
modern Germany, one that 
effectively constitutes the prehistory to the Federal Republic by virtue 
of its 
social-welfare planning, economic rationalization, and technocratic 
leadership. 
Defining modernization in terms of the social mobility and technological 
capacity 
of post-1949 Germany, Zitelmann draws a picture of Hitler as a nationally 
minded 
reformer whose intentions were very nearly realized. Thanks to the 
energetic 
efforts of Robert Ley, who headed the German Labor Front, the vision of "an 
equal-opportunity, upwardly mobile society purged of the old class and 
caste 
differences and encased within the framework of an extensively developed 
welfare 
state" was in fact translated into Nazi versions of the Beveridge Report, 
which 
were kept under wraps only due to the exigencies of total 
war. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
Ley's biographer, Ronald Smelser, has more sensibly noted that this 
"equal-opportunity" society was presupposed only in the name of German 
imperialism and only for racially acceptable Germans. While Zitelmann and 
Prinz 
do not ignore the racial context of these laws, they do treat Nazi social 
policy 
as wholly distinct from Nazi racial policy, and as a result their efforts 
to 
portray Hitler as a revolutionary modernizer leave out the most radical 
aspects 
of National Socialism, namely, racism and anti-Semitism. Moreover, their 
model of 
modernization excludes the political attributes--enhanced participation of 
freethinking individuals in the public sphere--with which it has always 
been 
associated. Indeed, Zitelmann deliberately severs social and economic 
progress 
from political liberalism. By rejecting normative approaches, he claims to 
encourage a more "value-free" discussion of modernization, a process he 
sees 
taking place in both totalitarian and liberal regimes. The tag of 
illiberalism, 
in other words, should not disqualify a candidate for the title of 
"modernizer." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The principal problem with Zitelmann's thesis is that it mistakes the 
means for 
the ends. Central to Hitler's worldview was the desirability of creating a 
racial 
state, and Nazi social policy was designed to advance this goal insofar as 
it 
created a healthier, more efficient, and more strictly gendered community 
of 
prospective soldiers, workers, and mothers. The wars against the Jews and 
the 
Slavs were not, as Zitelmann suggests, the F&uuml;hrer's sideshows to the 
main 
effort to make the German people more prosperous, nor were they, as 
G&ouml;tz Aly 
and Susanna Heim argue, the result of postwar planning to modernize and 
rationalize German capitalism. They were meant to reorder the biological 
hierarchy of the nation and the continent. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">
9</A>
</SUP>
Scholars have also 
criticized both Zitelmann and Prinz for taking too seriously the relentless 
initiatives of the German Labor Front and its wartime planning institute, 
the 
Arbeitswissenschaftliches Institut (the Ergonomics Institute), which, 
after all, 
owe as much to Ley's fantastic ambition as they do to an underlying 
ideological 
consensus among Nazi leaders. Yet the argument for intended modernization 
can be 
indulged because it rests mainly on intentions, not on results, the test 
by which 
Dahrendorf's and, to some extent, Schoenbaum's arguments have to be 
judged. To 
claim, therefore, that Nazi Germany remained divided by class or that 
social 
welfare provisions were inadequate, as critics do, does not invalidate 
Zitelmann's central 
<B></B>
 point about the Nazi leadership's 
conceptualization of 
itself. 
<p>
The debate over whether modernization (intended or not) did take place is 
likely 
to continue for some time. For the moment, it has reached a stalemate. On 
the one 
hand, some clarity has been provided by the careful macrosociological 
soundings 
of Jens Alber, who indicates that the Third Reich did not accelerate the 
long-term trends consistent with modernization (urbanization, expansion of 
the 
service sector, percentage of women working) and in some cases 
counteracted them 
(working-class access to higher education, professionalization in the civil 
service, religiously mixed marriages). Alber's argument has been 
underscored by 
historians who emphasize the absence of any meaningful social mobility, the 
prevalence of low wages among blue-collar workers, the largely illusory 
world of 
consumption, the deleterious effects of social-Darwinist polycracy, and the 
regime's hostile and self-destructive attitude toward scientific research. 
In the 
end, Alber draws a picture of German society in which the erosion of 
social life 
and the tentative nature of national consensus weakened the ability of the 
regime 
to mobilize citizens. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">
10</A>
</SUP>
On the other hand, local studies 
continue to 
lend plausibility to the argument in favor of modernization. R&uuml;diger 
Hachtmann, for example, maintains that shop-floor rationalization, improved 
working conditions, and service in the war combined to "deproletarianize" 
industrial workers. Numerous scholars also take seriously Nazi claims to 
honor 
workers, and argue that efforts to integrate them in the national 
community were 
not without effect. The German Labor Front, once again, has been credited 
with 
improving the status of workers, while analyses of the Hitler Youth or the 
social-service activities of middle-class women suggest that the regime's 
social 
policies enjoyed substantial support. The National Socialists were 
surprisingly 
popular insofar as they were identified with a new national mood that 
emphasized 
national integration, social reform, and economic prosperity.

Schoenbaum's distinction between social reality and interpreted social 
reality is 
perhaps the best way to make sense of the contradictory evidence. In the 
years 
1933-45, Germans lived in two worlds. Amidst a familiar universe of stable 
links 
to family, region, and social milieu, the Nazis constructed a "second 
world" out 
of "a network of organizations" in which "the traditional criteria of 
social 
worth and social placement had no validity."

Schoenbaum, Hans 
Mommsen, and others dismiss this fascist public sphere as merely "happy 
illusion" 
<I>(sch&ouml;ner Schein)</I>
 but it is worth considering just how 
consequential 
was the impact of Nazi policies on social identity. To what extent did 
Germans 
regard themselves as 
<I>Volksgenossen,</I>
 as people's comrades? The 
degree of 
self-mobilization into the Nazi sphere is impressive: in each of the last 
years 
before the war, over one million volunteers participated in the annual 
<I>Winterhilfe</I>
 (winter help) charity drive; several million more young 
people 
were happily recruited into the Hitler Youth; more than two million workers 
enrolled in German Labor Front apprenticeship programs; as many as eight 
million 
Germans joined local civil-defense leagues; and an astonishing fifty-four 
million 
had, by 1938, participated in some sort of 
<I>Kraft durch Freude</I>
(Strength 
through Joy) activity.

Germans, without relinquishing 
established 
ties to family, workmates, and neighbors, apparently moved relatively 
easily from 
one world to the other, adopting as they did the vocabulary of national 
integration, the messianism of the F&uuml;hrer cult, the terms of constant 
struggle, and eventually the identities of Aryan overlords vis-&agrave;-vis 
conquered civilians and foreign workers.

That the National Socialist world crumbled so quickly in 1945, to the

Weimar 
era, surely revealed the limits of the fascist dream world.

But 
given the few years in which the Nazis had to mobilize--Ley's German Labor 
Front, 
for example, did not begin its vast re&euml;ducation effort until the end 
of 
1934--and the half-life that the collective experiences of National 
Socialism 
continued to lead in the 1950s and 1960s, it would be a mistake to assume 
that 
this world was superficial because incomplete. In this context, the 
well-known 
postwar surveys, in which even lower-income groups readily admitted that 
Nazism 
had positive aspects, are worth remembering.

If the Nazis were modernizers, it was less on account of their efficacy in 
destroying traditional social milieus, as Dahrendorf claims, than of their 
capacity to manufacture an alternative public sphere in which Germans 
identified 
themselves increasingly as 
<I>Volksgenossen.</I>
 At least at certain times 
and 
places, they accepted Nazi premises about the equality of opportunity, 
responded 
to appeals in the name of the nation, and internalized many of the regime's 
hideous racial distinctions. There is considerable evidence that this 
fascist 
arena "deproletarianized" workers and validated individual achievement and 
thereby anticipated the consumer society of the 1950s. To confine the 
discussion 
of modernization to these terms, however, and so to regard National 
Socialism as 
a foundation for the Federal Republic, is to miss completely the first 
principle 
of Nazi politics, which was the construction of a racial "utopia" in 
Europe, not 
the establishment of a modern welfare state in Germany. Racial and social 
policy 
cannot be separated, as if the regime's efforts to eradicate whole peoples 
were 
tangential to otherwise beneficial policies on behalf of individuals. Even 
so, 
Zitelmann and Prinz have identified a crucial aspect of National Socialism 
that 
the historiographical emphasis on Nazi propaganda, Nazi terror, and Nazi 
genocide 
has missed: the degree to which the Nazis were committed to renovating 
German 
society. Although the Hitler regime cannot be adequately described as 
merely a 
German version of Beveridge's England or Roosevelt's America, the Nazis 
operated 
in the subjunctive tense, experimenting, reordering, reconstructing, and 
it is 
this spirit of renovation that qualifies National Socialism as modern.

<p>
The Nazi project was unabashedly racist. When Hitler's National Socialists 
came 
to power in January of 1933, they believed they stood at the very edge of 
history, poised to redirect the nation to fit the grooves of an envisioned 
Aryan 
future. The whole previous itinerary of Germany, in which a liberal sphere 
had 
been elaborated, in which 
<B></B>
 public claims had been put 
forward by political 
parties and interest groups, and in which various ethnic groups, provincial 
identities, and religious communities had survived and commingled, was to 
come to 
an abrupt halt. From the perspective of the Nazis, the year 1933 marked a 
sharp 
break. In place of the quarrels of party, the contests of interest, and the 
divisions of class that had so heavily compromised the ability of the 
nation to 
act, the Nazis proposed to build a unified racial community. 
<p>
On the one hand, the National Socialists sought to nurture the biological 
inheritance of Germans by putting in place an elaborate pronatalist 
social-welfare edifice and refurbishing the work place in a more rational 
manner. 
All the busy activity to promote family health, to reward parents with tax 
allowances, to extend young people technical training, and to provide 
workers 
with vacations and other diversions, may at first glance resemble an 
attractive 
"New Deal," but in fact was put in place to prepare Germans to assume 
roles as 
productive members of the national 
<I>Volksgemeinschaft</I>
 (people's 
community). 
The emphasis of social policy was always on the enforcement of discipline 
in the 
name of the community, not the provision of opportunity for the 
individual. On 
the other hand, this constructive program of national health was 
accompanied by a 
stern eugenics administration that sought progressively to weed out alleged 
biological dangers to the German 
<I>Volk.</I>
 From the very beginning, the 
regime 
applied measures to identify, segregate, and eradicate debilitating or 
supposedly 
foreign matter. Mental or physical disabilities, homosexuality, 
alcoholism, and 
even promiscuous or "asocial" behavior marked millions of Germans as 
candidates 
for surveillance and sterilization. Local health boards eventually cleared 
the 
way for the sterilization of at least half a million men and women. At the 
same 
time, so-called 
<I>artfremd</I>
 (alien) groups, particularly Jews but also 
Gypsies, were progressively banished from German public life. By 1938, the 
Third 
Reich was committed to completely eliminating Jews from Germany, a policy 
that 
shifted in the war years to the elimination of all Jews in Europe. The 
ultimate 
result of racial nurturing and racial weeding was to be a well-regulated 
<I>v&ouml;lkisch</I>
 society, strong and homogeneous enough to prosper in 
the 
dangerous era of world wars. The long-term well-being of the German 
<I>Volk</I>
would be ensured by a vast empire in eastern Europe, one that would provide 
Germans with the space, raw materials, and slave labor necessary to 
survive the 
coming planetary struggles. With the massive deportation of Polish 
villagers from 
designated German core areas, the arrival of thousands of German colonists 
to 
reclaim "ancestral" lands, the conscription of local labor in those 
efforts, and 
the concentration, ghettoization, and finally outright murder of Polish 
Jews, 
occupied Poland after 1939 was the site where the Nazi utopia was realized 
to a 
large degree.

<p>
The broad outlines of this racial order have never been in doubt. For the 
most 
part, however, the "Final Solution" has been studied in isolation. As a 
result, 
the obsessive anti-Semitism of leading Nazis has emerged as a central 
motif in 
the explanation of Germany's twentieth-century barbarism. The racial 
utopia of 
the Third Reich appears as a flight from modern history, contemporary but 
atavistic. Yet when social welfare, genocide, and foreign conquest are 
regarded 
as parts of a whole, Nazi 
<B></B>
 racism appears less 
anachronistically demonic and 
more connected to contemporary social practices. To see only the 
provisions the 
Nazis made to ensure national health and national efficiency or only the 
terroristic administration of the sterilization, deportation, and mass 
killing is 
to miss the central role that the 
<I>Volksk&ouml;rper,</I>
 or the "body" 
of the 
nation, played in National Socialism. The Nazis were neither mere 
social-welfare 
innovators nor simply obsessed racial fanatics; rather, they were 
committed to an 
ambitious program of racial reclamation in which they drew liberally on the 
premises of modern social planning. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">

</SUP>
<p>
The notion of the 
<I>Volksk&ouml;rper</I>
 stands at the intersection where 
the 
confidence of experts in the ability of science and technology to solve 
social 
problems confronted the growing acknowledgment of the limits to such 
engineering. 
By the end of the nineteenth century, advances in epidemiology, in 
particular, 
had established a new paradigm of biomedical therapy in which the 
illnesses of 
industrial civilization could be identified and cured. As the number of 
social-welfare and medical professionals grew and the scope of social 
services 
expanded, the population became increasingly regulated by distinctions 
based on 
value and worth. The establishment of psychiatry, the professionalization 
of 
youth and social services, the administration of public health and public 
hygiene, the rationalization of the workplace, the emphasis on the 
rehabilitation 
of criminals, and the propositions of eugenics all suggested ways in which 
the 
biological quality of the nation could be improved by techniques of 
nurturing, 
selection, and eradication. Seen in this light, the advances of modern 
science 
realized the most cherished assumption of the enlightenment, namely that 
this 
worldly existence could be perfected by human design. Indeed, Zygmunt 
Bauman 
characterizes modern existence as the articulation of an activist or, as 
he puts 
it, the gardener's approach to life. To one degree or another, he argues, 
the 
reproduction of social life involves "separating and setting apart useful 
elements destined to live and thrive, from harmful and morbid ones, which 
ought 
to be exterminated." For Bauman, the garden does not stand for paradise. 
It is a 
place where the ideals of self-perfection encompass the techniques of 
extermination, where classical proportion has been exploded by the frenzy 
of wild 
flowers and fiendish experiments. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">
20</A>
</SUP>
Bauman regards modernity 
not as 
"a civilizing process (Elias), or as a process of the progressive 
rationalization 
of all spheres of social life (Weber)," but as a startlingly value-free 
culmination of routines of cultivation. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">
21</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Detlev Peukert and the historians who have been influenced by him have 
advanced 
arguments similar to Bauman's around the Foucauldian theme of a 
therapeutic state 
that invests more and more resources to intervene and ostensibly reform 
social 
life. However, Peukert points out that the normative standards by which the 
interventions of social policy are formulated and justified are not, by 
themselves, sufficient to account for the murderous regime of National 
Socialism. 
Even considering the mounting frustrations of twentieth-century social 
planners 
as they bumped up against limits to reform, the persistence of illness and 
old 
age, or the intractability of juvenile delinquency, it took the harsh 
fiscal 
realities of the Great Depression to disassemble the grand optimism of 
universal 
health into various techniques of triage. 
<B></B>
 "In times 
of crisis," Peukert 
writes, the 
<I>Volksk&ouml;rper</I>
 was defined in increasingly "negative, 
restrictive terms. The central concern now becomes that of identifying, 
segregating, and disposing of those individuals who are abnormal or sick" 
("GFS," 
241). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
For Peukert a lethal combination of racism, abstract 
criteria 
of "value" and "nonvalue" in therapeutic practices, and high-technology 
solutions 
based on Depression-era cost-benefit analyses indicate that the "Final 
Solution" 
was "one among other possible outcomes of the crisis of modern 
civilization" 
("GFS," 236). 
<p>
What is frustrating about the pathbreaking analyses of both Peukert and 
Bauman is 
their insufficient appreciation of the fantastic vision of the National 
Socialists. The drive to renovate Europe along racial lines cannot be 
summed up 
either in the strict, delimiting terms of cost-benefit calculations or 
simply as 
one (horrible) version of the western ideal of self-cultivation. On the 
one hand, 
Peukert's emphasis on the Great Depression seems to me to be too narrow 
and, on 
the other, Bauman's generic vocabulary of improvement too broad a 
description of 
the Nazi racial project. 
<p>
A useful way of thinking about the links between the administration of 
modern 
reform and the extraordinary measures of National Socialism is to consider 
modernism in aesthetic terms. In literary criticism and art history, 
modernism 
encompasses new ways of looking that emerged at the turn of the century. 
The 
turbulence of metropolitan life pushed individuals onto uncertain pathways, 
undermined the ability of coherent story lines to narrate the topsy-turvy 
fullness of sensations and impressions, and put into doubt the practices of 
mimetic representation. It is this determination of impermanence that has 
characterized the idea of modernism. Not only was the present increasingly 
experienced as brand-new, completely different from the confines of even 
the 
recent past, but it was itself doomed to be merely transitory. Fashions, 
fads, 
and all ideas of the moment were thus typically modern creatures, bursting 
onto 
the scene with great energy before falling into disuse, persisting for a 
while as 
ruins, then disappearing again. It followed that any attempt to capture the 
essence of the age had to focus on these occasional features that 
Baudelaire 
described as 
<I>"le transitoire, le fugitif, le contingent."</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
To 
track the merely transitory was to represent the enduring nature of the 
age. 
<p>
The epistemological and aesthetic dimensions of modernism signal the 
discontinuous nature of social experience in the last centuries. Rather 
than a 
progressive articulation of power and possibility, civilization records the 
merely tentative security achieved in the face of inherent dangers. The 
rise of 
capitalism, the introduction of industrial technology, the establishment of 
central state administration, and the proliferation of military power that 
Anthony Giddens, for one, associates with the "created environment" of 
modernity, 
did not automatically advance the security of Europe. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
The 
threshold 
of risk advanced as well. Moreover, an increasingly well-regulated society 
generated new phobias as the definition and scope of social responsibility 
expanded. As a result, the practices of discipline that Peukert, Foucault, 
and 
many others see coalescing around the regulation of "the social" at the 
end of 
the nineteenth century were accompanied by revived premonitions of 
disaster. The 
<B></B>
 experiments and initiatives that were so confidently 
proposed were 
themselves only temporary measures, sure to give way to the fluctuations 
of time 
and to more novel and even more strenuous efforts at renovation. In light 
of the 
contingency of reform, modern social practices have often been scaled 
back, but 
the punctuation of catastrophe has also armed the imagination and 
emboldened 
experimentation. Over the last two hundred years, the identification of 
social 
debilities has led repeatedly to the creation of new therapeutic regimes. 
The 
National Socialists emerge as modernists because they made the 
acknowledgment of 
the discontinuity of history the premise of their fantastic political and 
racial 
designs. In what follows I want to explore more fully crisis and 
renovation as 
characteristics of the modern and of the Nazi modern.

The mastery over nature, which is the central tenet of modernization, 
increased 
the ability of men and women to manipulate the environment, but it also 
cast the 
natural world in ever more inimical and dangerous terms. In the seventeenth 
century, Francis Bacon and the master builders who followed him rewrote the 
nature they tried to rework, describing floods and storms and, later, 
emotions in 
increasingly chaotic and terrifying terms.

Steadily subduing 
but 
also suddenly exposing so many previously unrecognized dangers, the 
enlightenment 
appeared self-subverting and suspect from the outset. This ambivalence 
grew more 
serious over time because the potential of the industrial revolution 
revealed 
both the malleability and the fragility of the world. If nineteenth-century 
Europeans served the general cause of improvement, surveying wilderness, 
clearing 
forests, draining swamps, and digging mines, they also worried about the 
imminence of revolution, the fragility of the social order, the disease and 
poverty of the new industrial cities, and the biological degeneration of 
the 
modern individual. The insight of the engineer, the recognition of the 
sheer 
plasticity of the material world, always carried with it the 
acknowledgment of 
the impermanence of all thing--material edifices, market relations, social 
orders, moral persuasions. Especially after 1848, as the failures of 
liberal 
reform became clearer, corrosion came to be regarded as characteristic of 
industrialism as manufacture. "Social evolution," Ferdinand T&ouml;nnies 
wrote 
toward the end of the nineteenth century, "takes the form of continual 
disintegration." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">
26</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The desperate dynamism of capitalism and industrialism furnished observers 
such 
as T&ouml;nnies with multiple visions of chaos and dissolution. However, 
the 
fugitive formations he identified did not preclude efforts at 
stabilization. On 
the contrary, the recognition of crisis gave nineteenth-century projects of 
reform their urgency. In the face of cholera epidemics, working-class 
revolution, 
and urban poverty, the modern experience added up to a relentless struggle 
to 
regulate and renovate civil society. Late nineteenth-century notions of 
national 
solidarity dramatized the importance of renovating the social body. 
Forward-looking statesmen envisioned the nation as a factory in which all 
hands 
worked together for the common good. They accordingly 
<B></B>
 propounded ambitious 
programs of national efficiency, trade protectionism, political 
enfranchisement, 
social hygiene, and overseas expansion. Not to take the road to reform was 
to 
renounce economic prosperity and risk social disintegration and national 
decline. 
Social pathology and social experimentation thus went hand-in-hand. Emile 
Durkheim, perhaps the most famous diagnostician of the social ills of 
modern 
civilization as a result of his work on suicide, compared the statesman to 
a 
physician: "He prevents the outbreak of illness by good hygiene, and he 
seeks to 
cure them when they have appeared." 
<SUP>

To come to terms with what Peukert has portrayed as the Janus face of 
modernity--the techniques of amelioration and the circumstances of 
degeneration--was to admit both the necessity and the provisional nature of 
reform.

For the civil servant or the public health official, 
as 
much as for the artist, the enduring aspect of the modern age was 
instability. 
Modernism, which has usually been conceived in literary or artistic terms, 
has 
remarkable social and political implications. It is the apprehension of the 
malleable: the dark acknowledgment of the fragility and impermanence of the 
material world allied with the conviction that relentless reform could 
steady 
collapsing structures. In this perspective, modernism breaks with the past, 
manufactures its own historical traditions, and imagines alternative 
futures. 
Indeed, by being reflexive and making instability the explicit premise for 
its 
practice, modernism is hospitable not only to anarchic individualism but 
also to 
authoritarian designs. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">
29</A>
</SUP>
In my view, it is the premises rather 
than 
the attributes of modern projects that need to be examined more closely. 
What 
makes the twentieth century so promiscuous is not the content of the 
identities 
people have fashioned or the designs they have erected, but the 
presumption that 
contingency abounds and has to be managed, that chaos is about to take 
over and 
has to be negotiated. Again and again, modernists staged history as a 
boundary 
situation. The most spectacular displays of modernism are not to be found 
in a 
museum of expressionist art or a collection of prose poetry, but in the 
avant-garde political collaborations that sought to come to terms with a 
brand-new world regarded as unstable and dangerous. With every step, the 
political adventurer as much as the modernist poet or painter revealed 
ground 
that was tremulous, breaking apart, unclear. Liberal certainties that 
proposed to 
reveal the coherence of the world appeared completely inadequate. But 
whereas the 
latter made manifest the disenchantment that had been revealed, the former 
proposed more fearsome designs to overcome it.

The social experimentation of the nineteenth century was only a preamble 
to the 
hyperimaginative technologies of the twentieth. World War I, in particular, 
strengthened immeasurably the links between jeopardy and renovation. 
Leaving 
behind a landscape of ruins, it prepared the future as a vast site for 
experimentation. Although World War I is generally described in terms of 
immobility--four long years of irresolution, the war of attrition in the 
trenches, the scarcities on the home front--it cannot be fully understood 
without 
taking account of its astonishing mobility: not simply the battles beneath 
the 
ocean and above the ground, not just the dramatic movements on the eastern 
front 
in 1917 and 1918, but the extraordinary mobilization of 
<B></B>
 industry, the 
dramatic rearrangements of the domestic balance of power, the carefully 
choreographed production of civilian morale, and, mostly, the disruption of 
millions of private lives. Again and again, witnesses recounted how the 
war and 
its rebellious aftermath were experienced in terms of extreme 
discontinuity. 
Literary accounts of the war, argues Samuel Hynes, were overwhelmingly 
"descriptive rather than narrative: like the war itself they do not move 
in any 
direction."

<p>
If any single event overturned accepted assumptions about the steady, 
accumulating course of history it was the Russian Revolution in 1917. In 
the two 
years that followed, revolutions broke out in Berlin, Vienna, and 
Budapest, and 
militant strikes pulled the shadow of revolution across the rest of 
Europe. At 
the same time, the influenza epidemic killed off more people than the ten 
million 
the war had and invited comparisons to the Plague. War, revolution, and 
plague 
all raised apocalyptic expectations about the end of time. So startling 
were the 
rapid-fire events of the years 1914-19 that the remembered past had little 
to 
offer in the way of guidance. History had truly become a delinquent. 
Derailed by 
war and revolution, it no longer seemed to run along the straight and 
predictable 
railway tracks of the nineteenth century. One historian took stock of the 
postwar 
years when he prefaced his 1934 
<I>History of Europe:</I>
 "Men wiser and 
more 
learned than I have discerned in history a plot, a rhythm, a predetermined 
pattern. These harmonies are concealed from me. I can see only one 
emergency 
following upon another as wave follows upon wave." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">

</SUP>
Military 
defeat, 
the end of the monarchy, and the unsteady political and economic fortunes 
of the 
Weimar Republic gave this general sense of disorientation a particularly 
sharp 
edge in Germany. 
<p>
However, the German experience of the present as catastrophic and of even 
the 
recent past as irretrievable was not simply the premise for nostalgia. In 
the 
years after the war, the aesthetic categories of modernism--shock, 
disruption, 
discontinuity, and transience--profoundly shaped the way intellectuals, 
artists, 
scientists, and politicians regarded time and approached the future. A 
remarkable 
consensus characterized Weimar culture: the twentieth century had 
invalidated the 
governing lines of development that had held until 1914; World War I, in 
particular, marked a major break, but did so not simply by destroying a 
familiar 
world, but by undermining conditions of stability altogether. Harsh 
economics, 
nearly continuous ideological warfare, and a pervasive culture of cynicism 
contributed to a postwar state of emergency that not only exerted a 
powerful 
aesthetic appeal by generating image after image of extreme "boundary" 
situations, but provided the necessary qualifications for unprecedented 
experimentation in postliberal design. Catastrophic thinking appeared to 
reopen 
the possibilities of history that the "routinized, bourgeois conduct of 
political 
life" had previously foreclosed. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">

The rough politics of the 
post-1918 years--the technocratic impulses of organized capitalism, the 
rise of 
fascism, the insurgency of communism, and the killing ground of 
Auschwitz--rested 
on the dizzying assumption that history was malleable and could be 
reworked and 
reshaped in hitherto unimagined ways. Again and again, German thinkers on 
the 
Left and the Right linked emergency with renewal, tradition and convention 
with 
decadence. 
<B></B>
<p>
What made post-1918 Germany so classically modern was the central role that 
catastrophe played in its cultural apprehensions and political 
perspectives. 
Germany was the "modernist nation par excellence of our century," writes 
Modris 
Eksteins in his important book, 
<I>The Rites of Spring,</I>
 because it was 
"starkly future-oriented." A flight forward would resolve the anxieties of 
the 
present. Even the war was fought to change rather than preserve the 
world. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">

</SUP>
Three aspects of this apocalyptic vision stand out: 
the 
conviction that the grand narrative of "History" as it had developed over 
the 
course of the nineteenth century had been invalidated; the belief that 
these 
circumstances had been clarified by the extreme instability of private 
autobiographies and public institutions, particularly in the war; and the 
notion 
that this development and its recognition now permitted the wholesale 
renovation 
of the body of the nation. Characteristic postwar images of crippled 
veterans, 
unemployment lines, tumbledown metropolitan facades, and marauding armies 
all 
testified to the impermanence of the material world, but also to the 
tractability 
of its reconstruction. In other words, Germany stood outside "History," 
exposed 
to the anarchy of national and international politics, but also poised to 
reinvent itself. The future had never appeared so dangerous or so 
open-ended as 
when viewed from among the ruins of the postwar years. 
<p>
The prevalent feeling of discontinuity sustained a reckless politics 
manufactured 
to meet the challenges and opportunities that crisis seemed to imply. The 
formulation of Moeller van den Bruck, a conservative critic who was 
posthumously 
adopted by the Nazis, is apt. He repeatedly referred to the 
<I>"Revolutionsgewinn,"</I>
 the revolutionary yield, of the year 
1918.

Catastrophe had given the Germans the latitude to 
gamble. 
After their capitulation on the western front and their humiliation at 
Versailles, the Germans had become a 
<I>"Gefahrvolk,"</I>
 a people of 
danger, 
better able to prosper in conditions of extreme danger than a "tired, 
matured" 
France or England, nations whose opportunities and revolutions had long 
since 
passed.

Here was the modernist subject par excellence. 
<p>
Much of the political and cultural thought of the postwar years revolved 
around 
tooling techniques of mobility by which Germany could reinvent history. The 
long-range bombers, high-powered lasers, and other military technologies 
that 
patriotic pulp-fiction writers invented to revise the Versailles 
settlement were 
only the most fantastic features of the wholly "altered world" 
<I>(ver&auml;nderte Welt)</I>
 that Ernst J&uuml;nger and others claimed 
modern-day technology had in fact fashioned. Technology introduced new 
levels of 
danger, wrecking the once unassailable certainties of the bourgeois epoch, 
but 
also equipping a new generation of uniformed and disciplined machine-men 
with 
unrivalled power. Danger and energy were the two sides of the 
twentieth-century 
manufacturing process that had literally stamped the planet with an 
unmistakable 
geometry.

It is no surprise that America, as the most 
technologically marvelous nation, fascinated Weimar Germany, not only 
because it

exuberant liberation from tradition corresponded most closely to Germany's 
calamities in the

In much the

<I>Neue Sachlichkeit</I>
 (New Objectivity) architects and Bauhaus designers 
envisioned 
thoroughly functionalized spaces in place of the "chaos" of the 
marketplace and

<A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">

Weimar culture added up to an 
industrious 
invention of the future. 
<p>
The stress in all these visions was on the authoritative management of 
contingency: architecture promised a regulative geometry, geopolitics 
essential 
capacities, and biology genetic destiny. On the Left and on the Right, 
thinkers 
such as Ernst Bloch and Carl Schmitt groped for a new 
totality. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">

</SUP>
Nonetheless, the very premise on which these new social compacts were built 
introduced new dangers. The very delinquency of history had authorized the 
redemptive utopias of the machine-builders, architects, and eugenicists, 
but 
eventually it also withheld the crucial element of stability each sought. 
On the 
imaginary horizon, new technologies emerged to imperil the social order, 
emboldened enemies continued to mobilize along Germany's borders, the 
<I>Volk</I>
remained vulnerable to inherited pathologies. In this state of permanent 
emergency, renovation was a state of mind, a process rather than a 
destination. 
<p>
Renovation was the hallmark of National Socialism as well. The Nazis 
approached 
the twentieth century as a dangerous, unstable terrain that required 
relentless 
mobilization but also offered the Germans prospects for grandeur. This 
approach 
was obviously self-serving since the Third Reich used one emergency after 
the 
other to consolidate power. The extraordinary exertions it demanded, 
especially 
during the war, released the enormous social energy fueling the regime. To 
forego 
mobilization was to risk reviving the divisive quarrels of civil society 
and thus 
eroding the F&uuml;hrer's legitimacy. But the catastrophe of global war 
and the 
apocalyptic struggle the Nazis waged against Jews and other racial 
"enemies" were 
much more than ruses. Central to the Nazi worldview was the conviction that 
Germany was extremely vulnerable to biological deterioration. "He who 
leaves the 
plants in a garden to themselves," warned Walther Darr&eacute;, the future 
Nazi 
Minister of Agriculture, "will soon find to his surprise that the garden is 
overgrown by weeds." As a result, "questions of breeding" and social 
modeling in 
general had to be "at the center of all considerations." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">
43</A>
</SUP>
Unless the 
national destiny was forcefully managed, the parasitical influence of Jews 
and 
the disintegrative effects of democracy would proliferate. 
<p>
These emergency conditions of jeopardy created the conditions for 
renovation, 
however. If Germany embarked on far-reaching racial mobilization, it would 
be in 
a position to dominate the European continent. History was no guide, since 
the 
leaders of both Wilhelmine and Weimar Germany had failed to fashion an 
embracing 
<B></B>
<I>Volksgemeinschaft</I>
 or introduce necessary 
social and hygienic reforms. 
Again and again, the insinuation of the extraordinary dangers of the 
present, the 
fabulous prospects for the future, and the ceaseless necessity for struggle 
developed a basically nonlinear view of history. What scholars have long 
recognized as apocalyptic features in the National Socialist worldview, 
which 
invalidated the predictable "story line" of historical development since 
1789 and 
postulated the commencement of "new time," rested on a thoroughly modernist 
sensitivity to the discontinuous punctuation of crisis and 
opportunity. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">
44</A>
</SUP>
Although the Nazis referred frequently to 
eternal laws 
of history, they did so mainly to undermine the historical legitimacy of 
the 
Weimar Republic. It is highly significant that once in power the Nazis did 
not 
attempt to restore or preserve an authentic Germany. Instead, they sought 
to 
recast the nation in the newly fashioned mold of a high-performance racial 
society that encouraged social mobility in the name of national 
discipline. 
<p>
Not only the "blood and soil" vision of the Third Reich but also the 
anti-intellectual premises of the regime have been overstated. In the 
sciences, 
for example, technocratic impulses came to prevail. The so-called Aryan 
sciences 
were pushed to the margins as engineers, architects, and scientists 
mobilized to 
take advantage of the Nazis' "aggressive cult of feasibility." University 
research institutes, corporate laboratories, and military planners 
collaborated 
to fashion quite achievable "big science" projects. The unmistakable 
victory of 
the technocrats in the late 1930s underscored the spirit of renovation that 
prized improvisation, application, and practicality in difficult 
situations. 
Technocratic ideas thrived in this twilight zone of danger and 
possibility, the 
effects of which were only heightened by the conscripted labor, barbed 
wire, and 
utmost secrecy at sites like the Peenem&uuml;nde missile 
complex. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">
45</A>
</SUP>
The struggle to renovate and arm the national 
<I>Volksk&ouml;rper</I>
 was 
in no 
way incompatible with the spirit of modernism or the technocratic practice 
of 
scientists. Michael Burleigh's and Wolfgang Wippermann's insistence that 
modernism cannot possibly be racist is entirely unconvincing. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">
46</A>
</SUP>
<p>
To be sure, there was a long 
<I>v&ouml;lkisch</I>
 pedigree to Nazi racism. 
The 
rise of biological anti-Semitism at the end of the nineteenth century, the 
eugenic utopias of Alfred Ploetz, Willibald Hentschel, and Walther 
Darr&eacute;, 
and Germany's long-standing imperial ambitions in eastern Europe indicate 
that 
the Nazis were not original thinkers. Nonetheless, the project of racial 
construction they pursued had few precedents. In the name of racial 
hygiene, the 
Third Reich segregated Germans into categories based on "worth" and 
"value," 
embarked on far-reaching eugenics programs to "weed out" undesirables, and 
made 
provisions for a social-welfare administration to nurture and improve the 
health 
of the majority. Moreover, the Nazis mobilized in the name of a distant 
"Thousand-Year Reich," the foundations for which required relentless 
reform. In 
their view, struggle did not eliminate, but only contained the marauding 
movements of history, so that Germans had to prepare vigilantly for war as 
much 
as they had to cultivate their genes. At every step, successful conquest 
provided 
the precondition for further mobilization. In the 
<I>Generalplan Ost</I>
(the 
General Plan for the East), for example, occupied Poland and parts of the 
Soviet 
Union became the vast 
<B></B>
 site of an envisaged 
<I>Neureich,</I>
 a modern 
empire planned according to exact demographic, economic, and urban 
requirements 
in order to renovate the 
<I>Altreich,</I>
 pre-1938 Germany. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">
47</A>
</SUP>
The 
destruction of one half of European Jewry is stark testimony to the degree 
to 
which visions of a Germanic 
<I>Neureich</I>
 were implemented. 
<p>
The Nazis saw the world as a totally mobilized, pitiless landscape. The 
catastrophes of recent history had wrecked the edifices of the liberal age 
and 
exposed Germany to the predations of the Allies, the insurgency of the 
Bolsheviks, and, most dangerous of all, the prospect of biological 
deterioration. 
At the same time, however, the Nazis presupposed the ability to renovate 
the 
world. Grand imperial designs and well-ordered racial hierarchies would 
lay the 
foundations for previously unimagined German prosperity. The surprising 
contingencies of history had conred both the unpredictable terrain of 
danger 
and the very tractable zone of design. The features of modernism described 
both 
places. Defining itself in the machine-age terms of crisis and renovation, 
National Socialism constructed a totalitarian version of the modern. The 
Third 
Reich is, as Zygmunt Bauman concluded of the Holocaust, "a rare, yet 
significant 
and reliable, test of the hidden possibilities of modern 
society." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">

There is perhaps no artifact of the "Nazi Modern" better suited for 
inclusion in 
the museum of the twentieth century than the gas mask, a tool that 
acknowledges 
the extreme jeopardy of the moment, but holds out the possibility of 
survival as 
long as the wearer enrolls in a stern regimen of uniformity and 
discipline, ready 
for relentless onslaughts and murderous counterattacks. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">

</SUP>
In 
the end, 
as we know, the regime self-destructed. The total mobilization Nazism 
envisaged 
is no longer a credible response to the perils and possibilities of the 
twentieth 
century. Hopefully, we live more easily with indeterminacy and understand 
more 
clearly the costs of managing contingency. Nonetheless, the complicity of 
Nazism 
in the premises of modernism is haunting.

This is drawn from Marshall Berman, who defines "modernism as any 
attempt by 
modern men and women to become subjects as well as objects of 
modernization, to 
get a grip on the modern world and make themselves at home in it" (Marshall 
Berman, 
<I>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity</I>
 [New 
York: Simon and Schuster, 1982], 5). But, in my view, the circumstances of 
danger 
and the possibly illiberal outcomes of these efforts are not sufficiently 
emphasized by Berman. For a better sense of the range of modernisms, see

The importance of ambivalence and ambiguity has been stressed by 
Zygmunt 
Bauman, although he sees the elimination of ambivalence rather than its 
acknowledgment as typically modern (see Zygmunt Bauman, 
<I>Modernity and Ambivalence</I>
 [Ithaca, N. Y.: Cornell University Press, 1991]). Several 
excellent cultural histories explore the ways in which modernists question 
the 
epistemological status of vision, demystify "common sense," and seek to

<p>
Of all that has worked toward, furthered, and offered its services to 
National Socialism; of all that made it what it was; and of all that 
survives it without the most immediate horror, the most banal, 
self-evident and, therefore, most easily forgotten could also be the most 
effective. It is something that cannot primarily and in every instance be 
considered fascistic; something that has a very long and, many would say, 
venerable, mythological, theological, and philosophical prehistory; and in 
this history, especially in its most recent segment, it is what has been 
conceived of as a determination of man's essence. This banal, 
self-evident, and even still today widely presumed human factor is work. 
Work did not only organize what in fascism was crude violence and 
authority. The wish for work as the form of a remunerated life did not 
only aid Hitler's party in its ascent to power. This party did not only 
present itself as a labor party. Nor was it alone capital (according to 
Marx's handy formula, money that breeds itself, this self-producing and 
self-working capital) that paved the way for the Nazi clique. The call to 
work--to work on the country, work in industry, to work 
<I>on</I>
 the 
"people" and 
<I>for</I>
 the "people" of workers, to work on arms, to work 
with fist and brow, to work 
<I>against</I>
 everything and everyone who was 
said to be hostile or merely foreign to the work of the people--this call 
to work pervaded and determined 

 the entire 
ideological, social, and political organization of the fascist epoch. And, 
in turn, work--working out, working through, and working off 
<I>(Verarbeitung, Durcharbeitung, Aufarbeitung)</I>
--became the watchword 
for the atonement of guilt and the settlement of debts. Work, finally, 
comes to define the task that must be met by congresses for enlightenment 
and demystification. The meaning of this enlightenment and 
demystification, however, does not lie in mere working but, rather, in 
ceasing to carry on fascistically determined work. It lies in working 
through this work--and that also means in stopping or, at least, 
repeatedly interrupting it, to work off work, 
<I>this</I>
 work, its pre- 
and posthistory, the history of this work and history itself insofar as it 
determines itself as work. It lies in working through what work meant and 
what it demanded, in working out what it still means and demands. It lies 
in the imperative of work and in clarifying the work of this imperative: 
the opening up and disclosure of a dimension in which work stops and gives 
pause, desists and is ex-posed 
<I>(aussetzt).</I>
 As long as we do not 
clarify what work means for National Socialism and what National Socialism 
as an institution 
<I>of</I>
 work itself means, we cannot understand what 
this institution is beyond a political and ideological phenomenon of a 
past--yet how and to what extent "past"?--epoch. Nor can we clarify what 
work 
<I>against</I>
 fascism would mean and what we, for example, do--and 
whether "we" in fact "do" it--when we analyze some elements of this 
institution. 
<p>
The question about the work of fascism and about the endogenous fascism of 
work should not be posed solely for the sake of historical clarity. It is 
not only a historical or academic question. It is also a question about 
the structure of history, especially about the structure of what, from the 
perspective of work, the past and the future might mean and demand. Thus 
it is also a political question, one that, in principle, concerns the 
structure of present-day and future institutions--political, economic, 
juridical, and scientific. In his lecture "What Does It Mean: Working off 
the Past?" ("Was heisst: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit"), a lecture that 
up to this day, twenty-five years after its publication, is not obsolete, 
Adorno aired the suspicion that the formula of "working off" tended to 
serve the "unconscious, but not all that unconscious, defense against 
guilt" and, consequently, to perpetuate injustice. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">
1</A>
</SUP>
The 
defense function is thus designated as one of the constitutive elements of 
work in general. The historical continuity of National Socialism, made 
possible by this defensive work, forms the basis of one of the decisive 
considerations of Adorno's brief talk: "I regard the afterlife of National 
Socialism 
<I>in</I>
 democracy as potentially more threatening than the 
afterlife of fascist tendencies 
<I>against</I>
 democracy" ("AV," 126). In 
this remark, Adorno has his eye partly on the "comeback" of shady res, 
but also, and here he does not leave the slightest doubt, on the systemic 
continuity of fascism and a certain praxis of democracy. If working 
through the past 
<I>("Aufarbeiten")</I>
--not coincidentally but, rather, 
precisely because it is work--always simultaneously entails a defense 
against and disavowal of this past, then work itself is a form of history 
that produces continuity in the semblance of change and survival in the 
guise of overcoming. The passing of the past, history itself, is work. 
Thereby, however, it is precisely that past above and beyond which work, 
working off, is supposed 
<B></B>
 to lead. The threat that 
issues from the National Socialism 
<I>within</I>
 democracy issues as a 
form of historicizing work, as the work of history, that is essentially, 
and this means before every particular content, homogenization and 
formation. But this also means that in it consists the exclusion, 
disavowal, and tendential, or real, extermination of the nonhomogeneous, 
the nonassimilable, and the formless. Work is the form in which fascism, 
especialy fascism, survives, because, on the one hand, it was the form of 
survival priveleged by fascism, and, on the other, because it was survival 
in the manner of formation. The afterlife of fascism 
<I>in</I>
 democracy, 
in short, belongs to the life of fascism itself--and may, moreover, belong 
to that specific form of democracy that defines itself through, and as the 
democracy of, work, as ergocracy. 
<p>
Wherever its concept or praxis happens to show up, work (this for the most 
part still hypothetical thought could be drawn out) is work against 
vanishing, against death or the work 
<I>on</I>
 death. As the form of 
counterdeath, as organized defense against finitude and as the 
phantasmatic institution of immortality, it must--whether it seems to be 
connected to manifestly political, cultic, or discursive forms--meet two, 
and indeed two mutually exclusive, demands. On the one hand, it must 
entertain the closest imaginable affinity to precisely that death against 
which it is meant to guard. On the other hand, it must assert the claim 
that it is more powerful than death, far above it and itself immortal, 
indestructable, and infinite. If the system of National Socialism--and, in 
general, every totalitarian political system--defines itself as a system 
of work, then, according to this hypothesis, it also defines itself as a 
system that outlives its "own," infinitely appropriable death. Work and 
its politico-economic, social, and discursive system, would thus be the 
praxis of a virtually infinite survival, the survival of its "own" death, 
the praxis of outliving itself. In this sense, we would do well to attend 
to a further remark by Adorno: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
National Socialism lives on, and even today we still do not know whether 
it lives on merely as the ghost of something so monstrous that it has not 
yet died of its own death or whether it never died in the first place; 
whether the readiness for the unspeakable lives on in men as it does in 
the circumstances that enclose them. ["AV," 126] 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
National Socialism does not lie behind us as a historically surmounted 
phenomenon; it may even be utterly insurmountable and resistant to 
attempts at working through it. For, as a "monstrous" form of work, it is 
nothing but the production of its own afterlife and survival, and thus it 
continuously produces itself as specter--not as a chimera and mere 
illusion but, rather, as a reality worse than death: namely, the sheer 
<I>positivity</I>
 of life, dead life, living death. In a very precise and 
yet to be determined sense, National Socialism was work; for this reason 
it is difficult, perhaps in the end impossible, to bring its conscious, 
political, and historical working through to a close. Therefore, up to 
today it is undecidable, Adorno fears, whether organized murder, or the 
mere readiness for it, survives. 
<p>
The question that might help us apprehend fascism as both a historical 
phenomenon and a principle for the organization of life and survival, a 
question that may at 

 the same time alter the terms 
in which fascism is analytically treated, might run as follows: What does 
"work" mean in fascist ideology and, insofar as this ideology is an 
integral moment of the fascist system, what does "work" mean as a fascist 
institution? In order to sketch an answer to this question--and anything 
more than a sketch cannot be attempted here--I shall refer to three 
authors and to three motives that gave shape to the system of work under 
fascism: one mytho-theological, one ontological, and one morphological. 
These motifs can obviously not be separated from one another; rather, in 
their interweaving, they characterize the structure of what--in this 
particular historical segment and at its borders and thus also beyond 
them--is called "work." 
<p>
As "creative work" 
<I>("schaffende Arbeit"),</I>
 work was for Hitler a 
distinguished and distinguishing form of battle, hailed as the struggle 
that would overcome class war and achieve the unity of "fellow countrymen 
and -women." In his address of 1 May 1933, he celebrates Labor Day in a 
natural-mystical sense as the "day of life's becoming" and "awakening 
nature," and thereby at the same time, as the "day of winning back our 
proper force and strength." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">
2</A>
</SUP>
As the day of return 
<I>("Wiederkehr"),</I>
 of coming back 
<I>("R&uuml;ckkehr"),</I>
 of 
recovery, repetition, and winning back, as the day of restitution and 
reinstitution of this "natural" and "proper" "force," May Day is for 
Hitler "thereby also and at the same time," the day of "that productive 
work that knows no narrow limits, that is not bound to the trade union, to 
the factory and the office--the day of a work that we want to recognize 
and advance wherever it is executed in the good sense for the being and 
life of our people" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 259). The fusion of life, nature, and 
work, the naturalization of work and the ergotization of nature and of 
life, is not the only rhetorical--and not only rhetorical but also 
ontological--trick the agitator deploys here in his effort to conjure 
accord, harmony, and agreement. The work he means is not work 
<I>on</I>
nature but the work 
<I>of</I>
 nature, that is, the work of 
<I>our</I>
proper nature, "of our proper force and strength," and only as such is it 
work for "the being and life of our people." Vitalistic and dynamistic, 
work becomes the preeminent form for the appropriation of "the being and 
life of our people," the master form of self-appropriation, a form of 
force that is both natural and societal. It is the form of the 
self-production of the "proper," of the "ours," of the "we": the form of 
autochthonous self-socialization and the form of winning back one's proper 
history, the form of self-presentation. Work is auto-fusion. It is thus 
not as if the chief ideologue attributes to his spellbound public a firm 
egological substratum, as though it were a self-sufficient given. Instead, 
he suggests that the community he imagines is one of self-production and 
self-generation through work. The egologically understood society is 
self-producing and, in thus producing itself, a society that returns to 
itself, an ergological society. The subject is its process of production: 
"people" is substantially work. For this reason, he speaks of work 
exclusively in terms of "construction," as constructive 
<I>("aufbauend"),</I>
 and in terms that imply elevation, "raising up" 
<I>("Erhebung"),</I>
 a vocabulary that follows the verticalism of his 
ontology of the "being . . . of our people" 
<I>("des Seins . . . unseres Volkes"</I>
 [
<I>HRP,</I>
 259]). 
<p>
The conjuring of the "collective and harmonious work of all," in which 
society 
<B></B>
 should understand and take hold of itself 
and the people should once again become properly a people, is directed, 
domestically, ideologically, and politically, against the class-war 
politics of the trade unions. And Hitler, 
<I>psychopompous,</I>
 makes no 
secret of this. "The people," he says, interpreting their "unconscious," 
"the people feel, unconsciously, in their interior [!], that those 
ceremonies of the Marxist kind were at variance with the dawning spring. 
They did not want hate; they did not want struggle: they wanted to rise!" 
(
<I>HRP,</I>
 261). Yet in Hitler's address (and in others by him as well), 
this rising--
<I>"Erhebung"</I>
 here connotes "erection" more than 
"insurrection"--in which the self-presentation, self-production, and 
self-positing of the people are accomplished through work, bears 
resemblance to a curious Christian theologeme: the idea of the 
"resurrection of our people" (
<I>"Auferstehung unseres Volkes"</I>
[
<I>HRP,</I>
 261]).

The people that rises up through work to 
itself, to its proper "being and life," presents itself as a 
mytho-theological re, the divine savior, the hero, the redeemer and 
the self-redeemer, the resurrected Christ. The people is Christ, the 
<I>hic et nunc</I>
 resurrecting, insofar as it rises from the dead by the 
power of its work. The invocation of and the identification with this 
theological re assumes, however, that in the first place this people 
has been degraded and insulted (Hitler makes this assumption quite 
explicit, once again using the language of psychology to speak of an 
"inferiority complex" that has been "artificially inbred" [
<I>HRP,</I>
261]). It further assumes that this people has died and has become a 
corpse: "the world persecutes us[;] . . . it will not recognize our right 
to life" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 263). From the spell of humiliation and the denied 
right to life, from the spell of class conflict and death by lack of 
recognition, "we want redemption from this spell" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 261). We, 
the working people, want to redeem ourselves, this murdered and lifeless 
people. Work is the redemption of the inferior and from the inferior. It 
is the rise of the degraded to ranks of the chosen, the self-elected; and 
as self-elected, it is the resurrection of the dead in the radiant, 
spectral body--in the phantom, to recall Adorno's remark. The people, in 
its essence, is work, which, in turn, is essentially self-redemption. In 
his ergological restitution of the Christological myth, Hitler remains 
true to at least one motif of Christian dogma: this Christ that is the 
"German people" is not redeemed by a superior power. Rather, he redeems 
himself and rises by his own strength from the grave: "We know that all 
human work must in the end be vain if the blessing of Providence does not 
shine above it. But we do not belong to those who comfortably await the 
hereafter. We are given nothing. . . . We ask not of the Almighty, 'Lord 
make us free!' We want to be active, to work." (
<I>HRP,</I>
 263-64) Thus 
we alone, the unfree, make ourselves free: we 
<I>make</I>
 ourselves, we 
<I>work</I>
 ourselves, and we 
<I>liberate</I>
 and 
<I>redeem</I>
 ourselves 
through our own proper work. For the chief ideologue of the National 
Socialist German Labor Party and the chancellor of the Reich, work is--on 
Labor Day, 1 May 1933--the form of Christological self-redemption, 
self-erection 
<I>("Selbsterhebung"),</I>
 and the resurrection from the 
death of the Weimar Republic. It is the self-appropriation of the people 
in its self-production. Work is the mythical form of liberation, 
self-deification. The National Socialism that Hitler conjured up is a 
political mytho-theology of work. But this work is first of all 
<B></B>
 nothing else but a suggestion--in fact, the 
suggestion of 
autosuggestion and thereby the fictionizing of a self, the suggestion 
there could exist an autonomous, self-enacting, self-producing and 
self-resurrecting I. The real presence, transubstantiation, suggested here 
is a citation from an obsolete theology, from a theology become 
propaganda. It is a staged presence, and the work through which it seeks 
to become a reality consists in little more than the rhetorical 
reproduction of a mythological schema. It consists thus in the work of the 
refusal to work. The transred political body of the people "Christ" is 
not the spirit of Hitler's so-called spiritual people but, rather, its 
phantom, the specter of a specter.

Resurrected through "creative work" in its Christo-mythological phantom 
body, this people is robbed of its trade unions the next day, on 2 May 
1933, and one year later, on 24 October 1934, it is surrounded by the 
"German Worker's Front" 
<I>("Deutsche Arbeitsfront"),</I>
 the 
"Organization of Productive Germans of the Brow and Fist." Its goal is the

In this sentence, we are to 
understand that work as the form of the self-appropriation of the "being 
and life" of a people is simultaneously the form of its liberation from 
everything that is not itself, that is not proper to it--that is improper, 
foreign, and, at the same time, according to a troglodytically bipolar 
thinking, inferior, debased, unfree, and dead. The sentence "Work makes 
free" is the resurrection formula of the national-Christian, 
necro-vitalistic mythology of fascism. It defines Auschwitz as workplace: 
a workplace where the nonproper, the nonworking--and, it is thus 
insinuated, the already dead--are once more put to death, in order that 
the proper, the society of work, can emerge as the product of its own 
labor. It defines murder as the work of life on itself. It defines Jews as 
the unredeemed; it defines Communists as the dualists of class conflict; 
it defines Gypsies as the homeless and propertyless; it defines 
homosexuals as the un(re)productive: it defines them all as material for 
work, as work materials--namely, as the always already 
<I>former,</I>
 as 
the dead, unproductive people--and it defines work, on the one hand, as 
the production of corpses, and, on the other, as the production of the 
"gleaming," spectral body of the work-state. "Work makes free" is not an 
arbitrary or cynical slogan. It is rather the 
<I>name</I>
 of Auschwitz and 
thus the name of National Socialist Germany. It does not deceive about the 
reality of work but, rather, pronounces its truth: the system of 
liberation through work and, consequently, the system of 
self-production--the production of the 
<I>re</I>
 of the self--is the 
system of Auschwitz. Yet the unreality that cleaves to this slogan, as 
well as to the reality of the work it defines, and that seduces one to 
understand it as mere cynicism does not lack objectivity. For this work 
deemed to make free consists essentially in the rejection of a 
structurally irreducible moment of work itself, in the rejection of what 
in work exposes it to something foreign, to something that does not define 
itself as work, that is inappropriable and that does not permit of being 
included within the 
<B></B>
 defining borders of a univocal 
concept, a form or an idea. Work, as it determines the system of 
Auschwitz, the system of National Socialism, defines itself as the 
rejection of what is foreign to work and the foreignness of work "itself" 
through murder: the practical condemnation and extermination of what in 
work does not correspond to an egological re and thus does not conform 
to the process of ration, of what in work is not itself and what does 
not come back to itself. 
<p>
I turn to the second of the three motives that define the concept of work 
under National Socialism, the ontological motif, which is closely related 
to the Christological one. This ontological motif was stressed most 
energetically by Heidegger in 1933 and 1934 and represents a peculiar 
reinterpretation--but also interpretation--of his existential analytic of 
Dasein. Of course, my concern in this short sketch of Heidegger's relevant 
remarks is not to reconstruct the many complications attending his concept 
of work (a task, incidentally, yet to be accomplished) and still less to 
discuss these complications in the context of his thinking and its 
metamorphoses. What is important to me here is that, in his Rectorship 
philosophy, Heidegger conceived of the essence of Dasein--of finite being 
oneself 
<I>("Selbstsein")</I>
--as work and that he placed this 
determination of the humanity of man in the service of National Socialist 
propaganda. On 22 October 1933, in the largest lecture hall of the 
University of Freiburg, Heidegger delivered a speech in front of six 
hundred unemployed persons slated to be put to work by the Work 
Procurement Program 
<I>(Arbeitsbeschaffungsprogramm).</I>
 After having 
greeted them as "fellow German countrymen! German workers!" summoned to 
"communal work," and having explained that the Work Procurement Program is 
properly--and this "properly" is what matters here--
<I>"erection"</I>
 and 
construction in the new future of our people," he says that the decisive 
characteristic in the creation of work lies in the fact that it must 
"first and foremost make one again fit for Dasein 
<I>["daseinsf&auml;hig"]</I>
 in the state and for the state and thereby 
for the whole of the people." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
The procurement of work makes 
one fit for Dasein. In this, work is not only characterized as ego 
enhancement (though Heidegger also suggests as much when he states that 
the unemployed "should, 
<I>before himself,</I>
 win back the dignity and 
footing 
<I>["Halt"]</I>
 that is fitting and, 
<I>before his fellow</I>
countrymen, earn for himself the security and determination that is 
fitting" [
<I>NZH,</I>
 199]). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
In this, it is above all 
postulated that Dasein itself is essentially work: the creation of 
employment "creates" the capacity for Dasein, and since Dasein "in the 
first place and above all" lies in this fitness, in its capacity and 
possibility, it "creates," along with work, immediately also Dasein. 
Dasein is work, and--according to the ideology of the reconciliation of 
classes and social strata--it is the work of the "fist" no less than that 
of the "brow." Since work, in itself, must already be knowledge if it is 
at all to be properly work, the creation of work must complete itself 
organically--thus runs Heidegger's argument--through the creation of 
knowledge 
<I>("Wissensbeschaffung").</I>
 Heidegger deduces the necessary 
(and, incidentally, politically inoffensive) consequence from this program 
of deprivileging when he says 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
"The worker" and a person in possession of scientific knowledge are not 
opposites. Every worker is each in his own way knowledgeable ["ein 
Wissender"], and only as one 
<B></B>
 with such knowledge can 
he work at all. The animal is denied the prerogative of work, and 
inversely, everyone who knowingly ["wissentlich"] acts and everyone who 
scientifically ["wissenschaftlich"] decides is a worker [NZH, 202]. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
With this, as the (poorly founded) opposition to the animal well 
indicates, the essence of Dasein in general, its 
<I>humanity,</I>
 is once 
again located in conscious, knowing, and volitional work. "All work 
<I>as work</I>
 is something spiritual 
<I>["Geistiges"],</I>
 for it grounds 
itself on proper knowledge" (
<I>NZH,</I>
 202). 
<p>
For Heidegger, Dasein is characterized as the work of knowledge 
<I>(Wissensarbeit)</I>
 and thus, essentially, as technology. This 
characterization is made for the most part independently of the politics 
of class appeasement and against the background of 
<I>t&eacute;chne,</I>
from the lexicon of Greek philosophy, that is to say, understood above all 
as practical know-how and knowledgeable praxis. Heidegger postulates the 
identity of work and knowledge as 
<I>t&eacute;chne</I>
 in his Rectorship 
Address, written five months prior to his Work Procurement speech. In 
connection with the Aeschylus sitation, "know-ledge" ("
<I>Wissen"</I>
 is 
Heidegger's shorthand translation for 
<I>t&eacute;chne</I>
) "is much more 
impotent than necessity." Heidegger characterizes this "creative impotence 
<I>["Unkraft"]</I>
 of knowledge"--and thus of the work of knowledge 
<I>("Wissensarbeit"),</I>
 of work in general, and of 
<I>t&eacute;chne</I>
--as "
<I>the</I>
 ultimate form of man's 
<I>energeia,</I>
 the ultimate way of man's Being-at-work 
<I>["am-Werke-Sein"].</I>
" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">
9</A>
</SUP>
Accordingly, he characterizes 
"theory itself as the ultimate realization of the true praxis" 
(
<I>SDU,</I>
 12). 
<I>T&eacute;chne,</I>
 in the double sense of knowledge 
and work, is thus for the Heidegger of the Rectorship Address "the 
ultimate realization" of Dasein; and 
<I>energeia,</I>
 as "Being-at-work," 
is Dasein itself. Like the questioning of the philosopher, this work is 
not a prelude to something else but is "itself the ultimate form 
<I>["Gestalt"]</I>
 of knowledge" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 13). It is, I repeat, 
"form," and as this "ultimate form," it is the "ultimate actualization" 
and therefore the actuality of Dasein. This means, however (and Heidegger 
deduces the consequence with the precision of a logician), that Dasein 
--determined as work, 
<I>t&eacute;chne,</I>
<I>energeia</I>
--
<I>creates</I>
 not only itself but also (incidentally, 
very much in contrast to the antisubjectivist conception of 
<I>Being and Time</I>
) its world. Heidegger writes: "If we want the essence of science 
in the sense of a questioning, unprotected steadfastness amid the 
uncertainty of beings as a whole, then this will to essence 
<I>["Wesenswille"]</I>
 will 
<I>create</I>
 for our people their world of 
most interior and exterior danger, that is, their truly spiritual world" 
(
<I>NZH,</I>
 203).

<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">

</SUP>
The "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of work as 
the "essence" of science as well as of Dasein allows for steadfastness 
<I>("Standhalten")</I>
 in the world of danger. But to the extent that 
"form" willfully withstands this danger, Heidegger argues &agrave; la 
Hegel, it is not passively exposed to but is itself agent, mover, creator 
of this world and this danger. Dasein, therefore, is essentially 
constituted as 
<I>auto-t&eacute;chne,</I>
 and it is as such doubled in 
itself, polemically different from itself: it is the steadfast "form" of 
work and, at the same time, the working out 
<I>("Erarbeitung")</I>
 of 
danger--self-assertion and self-endangerment in one, creating and 
"creative impotence," 
<SUB>
<IMG SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek01.gif">
ALT="[greek text]">
</SUB>, which as such exposes itself to the 
<SUB>
<IMG SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek02.gif">
ALT="[greek text]">
</SUB>
 it worked for and itself 
created. In contrast to Hitler's paranoid 
<B></B>
 dissociation of what is properly one's own and what 
is foreign, Heidegger insists that in the work of Dasein itself there is 
something at play that remains utterly irreducible to this work. If Dasein 
is work, then it is work only because it is exposed in itself to something 
other than itself. And yet, the Rectorship Address leaves no doubt that 
the work of Dasein ought not be work 
<I>with</I>
 or 
<I>on</I>
 this other 
but, rather, work 
<I>against</I>
 it. It should be work 
<I>against</I>
 what 
in this work itself stands out as "uncertain" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 13, 14), 
"constant world uncertainty" (
<I>"st&auml;ndige Weltungewi&szlig;heit"</I>
[
<I>SDU,</I>
 14]), as "hidden" (
<I>"verborgen"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 11]), as 
"madness" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 19), "cessation" (
<I>"Ende"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 10]), 
and "nonbeing" (
<I>"Nichtsein"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 10])--in short, against 
what stands out as foreign to work, against what is out of work and 
unemployable. Dasein is ergontologically constituted. But, for precisely 
this reason, it cannot contest the necessary existence of what is foreign 
to work, of the other, without simultaneously entering into battle with 
itself as an other that is not yet itself. As work, Dasein, being-there, 
is being-there-in-danger 
<I>(Da-in-der-Gefahr),</I>
 and, as such, it is 
being-there-with-the-other 
<I>(Da-beim-Anderen-Sein).</I>
 Its 
<SUB>
<IMG 
SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek01.gif" 
ALT="[greek text]">
</SUB>
exists only to the extent that it remains in itself exposed to an 
<SUB>
<IMG SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek02.gif">
ALT="[greek text]">
</SUB>. 
The option of thinking work as defined 
<I>against</I>
 this other is not a 
philosophical but a political (indeed, a national-political and 
ego-political) option--one with which the self of Dasein in the egological 
form of the 
<I>proper</I>
 people was meant to stand its ground and be 
hypostatized as an ergopolitical state of the self. 
<p>
Despite its recognition of the "uncertain," or "questionable," of the 
"aletheically" hidden and therefore irreducibly other, the ontology of 
work in Heidegger's Rectorship Address remains an ontology of the 
"questionability of 
<I>proper</I>
 Dasein" (
<I>"Fragw&uuml;rdigkeit des eigenen Daseins"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 15]). It is an ontology of a particular 
"people" philosophically and politico-historically privileged in its work, 
an ontology of 
<I>proper</I>
 work and of work itself as inalienable and 
unexposed 
<I>propriety.</I>
 Very concretely, this means:  that work is 
the essential form of socialization;  that the society of work is 
always the only 
<I>proper</I>
 society--the "people";  that it can be a 
society only of aggressive appropriation, one that must "advance" and 
"march forward" 
<I>("vorr&uuml;cken")</I>
 into the uncertain (
<I>SDU,</I>
14); and  that this work-society must be voluntaristically organized, 
must be a work-state and leader-state. Heidegger declares in his Work 
Procurement speech that "'worker and work,' as National Socialism 
understands these words, divides not into classes but binds and unifies 
fellow countrymen and social stations into the one great will of the 
state" (
<I>NZH,</I>
 202). Work is the "will 
<I>of</I>
 the state"--that is, 
<I>genetivus subjectivus,</I>
 work is always already that which the state 
wills. However, it also means that all work, to the extent that it is 
work, is also already a will for the state and the work of the state and 
on the state. Heidegger, along with Ernst J&uuml;nger, calls the state of 
Dasein the "work-state" (
<I>"Arbeitsstaat"</I>
 [
<I>NZH,</I>
 202]); it is 
the state toward which the work of the self-enacting and self-instituting 
Dasein that wills itself as state strives. This"work-state"is Dasein itself; more precisely, it is the self of Dasein as 
institution. Understood as work and technology, Dasein is immediately its 
own proper instatement, its nationalization 
<I>("Verstaatlichung").</I>
 It 
is--in a turn of phrase that Heidegger soon thereafter, in the Nietzsche 
<B></B>
 Lectures, denounces as the last re of the 
occidental metaphysics of subjectivity--the will to power as state. And 
because work is the "ultimate form" (
<I>"h&ouml;chste Gestalt"</I>
[
<I>NZH,</I>
 202]) of man, it must subject itself to the principle of form 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 and follow a leader, in whom the "will of the state" 
(
<I>"Wille des Staates"</I>
 [
<I>NZH,</I>
 202]) embodies itself. In what 
the will to work wills, Heidegger can accordingly conclude, "
<I>we follow only</I>
 the preeminent volition of our leader. To become a follower 
indeed means: . . . incessantly 
<I>["unausgesetzt"]</I>
 willing that the 
German people, as a people of work, . . . as a work-state, secure itslongevity and greatness" (
<I>NZH,</I>
 202; my emphasis). Just as 
Heidegger insists at the end of the Rectorship Address that "our"decision for "ourselves" has "already been decided"by the 
"young and newest force of the people" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 19) and that our 
decision is, therefore, only a decision for the "force" and "form" of the 
decision, he supposes here, at the end of the Work Procurement speech, 
that the will of the "we" is "already" "surpassed" by the will of the 
"leader" and, thus, by a will to what has "already" been willed. Dasein, 
the will to power as state, can first come into its own, according to this 
logic of self-appropriation, self-forging and self-formation, in the 
re of the leader. It thereby adheres to a logic of the historical 
present thought as restitution and reinstitution. In willing the already 
willed and in deciding for the already decided, Dasein comes 
<I>back</I>
to its proper future as a past in which all that can be has "already" been 
willed and all that must be has "already" been decided. 
<p>
Inthis circular self-comprehension of the will in the form 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of the state, "work-state" and leader-state, Dasein, 
thought and promulgated as work, achieves presence and denies, indeed 
disavows in its incessant 
<I>("unausgesetzten")</I>
 willing, that it must 
itself in the first place be experienced as exposedness 
<I>("Ausgesetztheit"),</I>
 if indeed it should be able to determine itself 
as work. "Work = presence" is the formula Heidegger uses in his Logic 
Lectures of the summer semester of 1934. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
The presence of 
which he speaks here is understood to be eminently historial, namely, 
productive of history. But it is auto- and tauto-historical.In a 
steadfast form attuned to "longevity and greatness," it is history as the 
self-appropriation of work: monumentalization of the autonomy of the self 
<I>("Selbst&auml;ndigkeit")</I>
 at the cost of all 
<I>others.</I>
 As with 
Hitler, the Christological feature of self-presentation and 
self-historicization is not lacking in Heidegger's treatment of the 
monument of work: "God is dead," Heidegger proclaims--citing the 
pronouncement of Nietzsche, the "last German Philosopher"--and suggests 
that he himself, as the very last, the final, or even post-final, 
philosopher, can proclaim the finite resurrection of this dead God, the 
restitution and return of finite Dasein in the form of the technological 
"work-state." 
<p>
Dasein is no longer a temporalizing projection into the unrepresentable 
and unbounded open as it was in 
<I>Being and Time.</I>
 It is also not 
ex-position and exile into the unembodiable, as in Heidegger's later 
philosophy. Dasein is here, in the political fundamental ontology of the 
Rectorship period, work as installment and installation, as the 
putting-to-work 
<I>("die Einsetzung und das 'Ins-Werk-Setzen'")</I>
 of the 
truth of its present decision for its "ownmost possibilities" in the form 
of the "work-state" and its "leader." And this Dasein is the 
self-production of the finite subject 
<B></B>
 only to the 
extent that it is the re-production of the previously posited 
Christological paradigm of reproduction. It is ex-position not to the 
unpositable but into positing--activism of positivity. Here, the question 
is no longer one of the openness of Being as being-other but of the arrest 
and internment of Being in what already is 
<I>(im schon-Seienden).</I>
 The 
political ergontology and morphontology of Heidegger during the Rectorship 
period was the ethical and political collapse of his philosophy: the 
collapse, namely, of the ontological difference, in many respects an 
endogenous collapse, for Heidegger never ceased to think Being as the 
Being 
<I>of</I>
 beings and 
<I>of</I>
 Dasein. 
<p>
I turn to the third determination of work, the morphological, and to the 
third author, Ernst J&uuml;nger. Though published before the National 
Socialists came to power in October of 1932 and denounced by Hilter as 
National Bolshevist, internationalistic and "dangerous to the public," 
J&uuml;nger's book, 
<I>The Worker</I>
<I>(Der Arbeiter),</I>
 is the 
protofascist manifesto par excellence. J&uuml;nger himself had dedicated a 
presentation copy of 
<I>Fire and Blood</I>
 in 1926 to "the national leader 
Adolf Hitler!" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
but after 1932 J&uuml;nger disdained all 
contact with the "shooting-gallery re." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">
13</A>
</SUP>
Much later, he 
time and again defended 
<I>The Worker</I>
 as a nonpartisan diagnosis and 
answered his critics with the charge, "after the earthquake, one smashes 
up the seismographs." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">
14</A>
</SUP>
This sententious defense is 
symptomatic in its dishonesty. In the first place, fascism was not a 
natural event--but this is exactly how J&uuml;nger, in a way that we will 
have to discuss, conceptualizes it. In the second place, after an 
earthquake one smashes up only the seismographs that failed to register 
the quaking. In the third place, the diagnostician of political 
catastrophes is, in fact, reproachable for not having taken steps to 
prevent them. Even in his muddled allegory 
<I>Auf den Marmorklippen,</I>
J&uuml;nger did not so much as lift a finger or utter a word against 
National Socialism. That he maintained a distance between himself and his 
protagonists was a matter of intellectual 
<I>d&eacute;go&ucirc;t.</I>
 That 
he later condemned them he himself repeatedly attributed to his contempt 
for their technical incompetence. In Heidegger's conciliatory but 
nonetheless devastating critique of J&uuml;nger, "Zur Seinsfrage" (On the 
question of being)--a text also readable as a self-critique of his 
Rectorship philosophy--Heidegger is less disingenuous, both politically 
and theoretically more precise, when he recalls that a small circle of 
university instructors, for whom he had elucidated 
<I>The Worker</I>
 in 
the winter semester of 1938-39, were not surprised that the discussion had 
been "monitored and ultimately broken up." "For," explains Heidegger, "it 
belongs to the essence of the will to power not to let the actual that it 
empowers appear in actuality as what it itself 
<I>is.</I>
" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">
15</A>
</SUP>
Translated, this means: the Nazis--the actualized will to power--wanted to 
prevent the truth about themselves from being told. And this means

J&uuml;nger concludes

us."

Like nearlyeverything else he has written, this 
not only pompously but also wretchedly formulated imperative, this "task 
that is expected of us," dictates "the steeling of arms and hearts." 
Evoking Max 
<B></B>
 Weber's metaphor about the "steel-hard 
casing" 
<I>("stahlharten Geh&auml;use")</I>
 required by the "rational way 
of life" and borne by "the spirit of Christian asceticism," J&uuml;nger 
does not of course reiterate Weber's culture-pessimistic alienation thesis 
but, rather, formulates the martial program of a constructivism that will 
bring "pure existence into view," "pure existence" as "form" 
<I>("Gestalt"),</I>
 in the unity of the "dominion and form 
<I>["Gestalt"]</I>
" of the worker (
<I>A,</I>
 246). From the first to the 
very last pages of his treatise, J&uuml;nger leaves no doubt that he is 
not concerned merely with a limited sociological phenomenon--the 
preponderance of the "lower classes," the ever increasing pervasiveness of 
its lifestyle, the planetarization of the "workshop-landscape." His theme 
is, more grandly, the "ultimate existence" (
<I>A,</I>
 36), the "fullness" 
of Being "in the force of a shaping 
<I>["Pr&auml;gung"]</I>
 that only just 
began" (
<I>A,</I>
 45). 
<I>The Worker</I>
 lays claim to being nothing less 
than an ontology--not an ontology of work (a task reserved until much 
later for the restorative attempts, Marxist in orientation, of 
Luk&aacute;cs) 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
but rather an ontology of the "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of its "bearer," a morphontology. J&uuml;nger's book 
presents itself not only as the diagnosis of a transformation of class 
structure, not only as a prognosis of the planetary uniformation of 
society, time- and space-experience in a "plan-state" and "plan-scape" of 
unimaginable proportion. It presents itself much more as the 
theory--better yet, the vision--of an organic as well as technical 
paradigm that--exempt from all fluctuations, movements, and 
developments--persists as the transhistorical ground of all res. "Thus 
the re of the worker," J&uuml;nger writes, "is more deeply and 
statically em-bedded in Beingthan all the likenesses and orders 
with which it confirms itself, deeper than constitutions and works, than 
man and his communities, which are like the changing expression on a face 
whose fundamental character persists unchanged" (
<I>A,</I>
 45). The name 
"worker" is neither a professional title nor a reference to human 
individuals or masses. Individuals and masses, according to J&uuml;nger, 
are bourgeois and thus obsolete categories. Rather, "worker" is the title 
of a "new type of man," a type in which the "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of 
the worker" is embodied" (
<I>A,</I>
 311). 
<p>
In its onto-morpho-logical conception, 
<I>The Worker</I>
 not only exhibits 
that disposition for totality whose loss had been bemoaned by left-wing as 
well as right-wing intellectuals of the Weimar Republic. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">
18</A>
</SUP>
It 
also "embodies" and "represents" this totality founded in the "re" of 
an indelible "Being." And to this "re" corresponds the totality of the 
world--a correspondence J&uuml;nger never tires of stressing. It is a 
world that increasingly assumes the character of a "work world" 
<I>("Arbeitswelt"),</I>
 without niches, refuges, or vestiges of nature. 
The convergence of "total work character" 
<I>("totalem Arbeitscharakter"),</I>
 which appears as the "mobilization of matter" in 
the "totality of technical space," with the "totality of the type," which 
sketches itself in the "mobilization of man"--this convergence of power 
and world "expresses itself," J&uuml;nger writes, "in the fusion of the 
difference between the organic and the mechanical world; its symbol is the 
organic construction" (
<I>A,</I>
 177). The fusion anticipated by 
J&uuml;nger between the work type 
<I>("Arbeitstypus")</I>
 and the work 
world 
<I>("Arbeitswelt"),</I>
 between organic and mechanical mobilization, 
is thus guaranteed by a kind of preestablished harmony. Here, they 
coexist in the transcendent "Being" of 
<B></B>
 the "re" 
<I>("Gestalt"),</I>
 which becomes visible in its symbol, the "organic 
construction" (
<I>A,</I>
 177). This "organic construction," this "symbol" 
of "static Being" is, however, nothing other than technology (
<I>A,</I>
309). It represents "form" 
<I>("Gestalt"),</I>
 whether in the means of 
production, from the wheel to electricity, or in lifestyle, from the 
uniform gesture to cultural orders. And conversely, technology is, as 
J&uuml;nger understands it, symbol. "Technology," he explains, "is 
meaningful only because it is the way in which the re 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of the worker mobilizes the world. This fact endows it 
with the status of a symbol" (
<I>A,</I>
 200; cf. 196 and 311). Technology 
is symbol or representative or representation of Being. The "total 
mobilization" of matter and man through technology is the symbol or 
representative or incarnation of this static form 
<I>("Gestalt").</I>
 "The 
type . . . possesses rank in the degree to which it embodies the re of 
the worker" (
<I>A,</I>
 311). The "work-state" and its "plan-scape," the 
workshop-landscape and its "work-armies" 
<I>("Arbeitsheere")</I>
--or 
anything else that becomes an object of the physiognomic and political 
visions of J&uuml;nger--is embodiment, representation, expression, 
radiance, crystallization, appearance, symbol or--time and 
again--"representation" of "presence." And this holds a fortiori for work. 
It is always work in the strongest sense and has meaning as work 
exclusively to the degree that it is the work of signification, of 
symbolization, and of the representation of "the worker," of his "re," 
of his, and thus of its, 
<I>proper</I>
 "presence." It is 
<I>properly</I>
work only as a return to what does not work, work only as the annulment of 
work to the benefit of the epiphany of "static Being" (
<I>A,</I>
 309). 
<p>
It goes without saying that this conception of work, interpretation, 
language, politics, and being is anything but "revolutionary." Or, it is 
"revolutionary" only insofar as it is the restitution of a classical 
morphology, of an idealistic semiology--a symbology--the restitution of a 
classical, metaphysical ontology of work. What distinguishes J&uuml;nger's 
conception from these, however, is his taste for undifferentiated 
uniformity, his obsession with the formalism of the "total." As a result, 
he promulgates not a national or international socialism but a planetary 
socialism without society--not a worker's state, but a "work-plan-state" 
under the "will to total dictatorship" (
<I>A,</I>
 45). This may prevent 
him from being a vulgar racist, but it causes him to be a techno-racist, 
who glimpses the burgeoning of a "new race" of "consummate stamp" 
(
<I>A,</I>
 245), with "racelike quality" (
<I>A,</I>
 212), from the "native 
soil of the people" (
<I>A,</I>
 307). His fanatical fixation on the total 
permits him to consign to oblivion bourgeois museum culture and the 
"so-called cultural assets" whose conservation it serves. But, at the same 
time, it forces him not only to generalize art as the "representation of 
the form of the worker" (
<I>A,</I>
 217) but also to render it 
"absolute"--and, thus rendering it absolute, to conserve it. J&uuml;nger's 
totalism permits him to recognize that the universalization of 
technology--the "mobilization of the world through the form of the 
worker"--will result in the wholesale destruction of cult powers; his 
totalism also permits him to recognize in this universalization "the most 
decisive anti-Christian power" (
<I>A,</I>
 161). But this same totalism 
causes him, in turn, to assign "cultic significance" (
<I>A,</I>
 246) to 
the "form of the worker." In short, J&uuml;nger's gestures are dictated by 
a repetition compulsion. Not only does he time and again 
<B></B>
 repeat one and the same argument--his argument is itself 
fundamentally one of repetition, restitution, reinstitution: the cults 
must be destroyed in order that the one cult can be erected; thefeeble arts of civil society must beswept away and room made 
for absolute art as the representation of the generative "elementary 
forces" (
<I>A,</I>
 207);races are obsolete, but in their place 
rises a techno-race of precision and violence. Nation states are wasting 
away in the anarchy of competition. They will be replacedby the 
planetary dictatorship of a peerless order. The destruction of the 
particular is always at the service of its resurrection in the general; 
the dissolution of the manifold, at the service of the re-creation of its 
one model; the break up of forms and movements, at the service of the 
reconstruction of the one static form. J&uuml;nger's system is not 
National Socialist for the sole reason that it represents the latter's 
hypertrophy--and thus, quite simply, its principle. His system is the 
system of the planetary techno-morpho-logical archi-fascism. It is the 
system of "total mobilization" to the point of the immobility of the form 
(
<I>A,</I>
 220), the system of the planetary performance of form, ofpure positivity. 
<p>
"The task of total mobilization is the transformation of life into energy. . . . Thus, it draws on the potency of life, while formation gives 
expression to Being and must avail itself not of a language ofmovement but, rather, of a language of forms" (
<I>A,</I>
 220). The 
identity of energy and form, of a language of movement and one of forms, 
culminates in that "mathematically factual style," that "precise, univocal 
language" in the "univocal space" (
<I>A,</I>
 279) of an "univocal and 
rigid work world" (
<I>A,</I>
 277), whose organ is the press. The univocity 
of the language of work, which affords just as little latitude to other 
meanings as to other languages and fulfills itself every instant in the 
actualization of its ideal of discourse, finds its perfectly suited 
counterpart in the "changed way in which one today reads the newspaper." 
J&uuml;nger finds: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Even reading is no longer compatible with the concept of leisure; it 
appears far more with the markings of the special work-character. . . . 
One wants to feel that the world changes as one reads, yet, at the same 
time, this change is constant in the sense of a monotone alternation of 
the colorful signals one scurries past [in public transportation]. 
[
<I>A,</I>
 277] 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The constant change at which the act, the "work-act" 
<I>(Arbeitsakt),</I>
of reading aims, according to J&uuml;nger, is a "change" exclusively 
within the static conditions of the one, final, "univocal world of work." 
It is the constant recurrence of the same, of the "monotone alternation" 
of traffic signals. The "total mobilization" of signal language and of its 
immediate correspondent signal reading is nothing else than the 
mobilization to the static form of "Being." In this totally mobilizedlanguage, the world changes instantaneously when it is spoken or read. 
It is a "happening" that "distinguishes itself through presence" 
(
<I>A,</I>
 277), through the presence, namely, of a form that lies in the 
generalized auto-performance as the automatic identity of stating and 
understanding, of mobilization and constancy, of act and meaning, 
addresser and addressee. It is in this perfect collapse of all pragmatic, 
semantic, grammatical, and 
<B></B>
 rhetorical dimensions of 
language that its "special work-character" takes shape. In this collapse, 
performativism and formalism, monosemantism and autotropism collaborate in 
the uniformed universe of there of the worker. The 
archi-fascism that presents itself in this re is nothing other than 
the system of technically installed presence: the system of the "nothing 
other." 
<p>
"Work in the highest sense," so writes J&uuml;nger, "means representation 
of the worker" (
<I>A,</I>
 212). But this means self
<B>-</B>
representation 
of presence, representation of what does not work; accordingly, work in 
the highest sense means the annulment of work. The consequence is 
compelling, and J&uuml;nger never ceased to repeat it in every imaginable 
variation. He thereby delivered the formula of the National Socialist 
ideology of work. For all three models of work discussed here--the 
mytho-theological, the ontological, and the morphological--work is, 
paradoxically, exactly what does 
<I>not</I>
 work. For Hitler, work is the 
propagandistic citation of the myth of resurrection and 
self-appropriation. It directs itself against everything that is other as 
the already dead and terminates political work in murder. For the 
Heidegger of the Rectorship philosophy, work is the structure of Dasein 
insofar as it does not just direct itself to but 
<I>against</I>
 the other 
and only thus assists in the establishment of one's proper "form" 
<I>("Gestalt").</I>
 For J&uuml;nger, it is the representation of "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 and reabsorption of movement in its constancy. Defined 
as self-appropriation, self-restitution, and self-institution, work is 
always the technology, or symbol, of what does not work. It is stasis,order, mythically immobile form, or historically transcendent Being. 
It is thus the always already proper that should always already be 
belonging and conforming to itself. In work, all three models promise 
freedom from work. That means, however, that they promise freedom from the 
other. They are models of self-resurrection insofar as they are models of 
the destruction of the other. The work that they propagate is actually 
resistance 
<I>against</I>
 work. For, however much it may still be a 
project of appropriation and formation, work that is not fascistically 
organized is always exposed to an other irreducible to the form of the 
self and inaccessible to its appropriations. It is always also a project 
that remains open to the other, to nonwork, to what is foreign to work, to 
an 
<I>anergon.</I>
<p>
One of the reasons why it is so difficult to work through the fascistic 
obsession is that it is an obsession that consists in the systematic 
disavowal of work. The institutions of National Socialism did not want to 
be open projects but, rather, immediate realizations of an idea--orof a phantasm. The institutions wanted to bring history itself to a 
standstill in form and monument, and it is thus difficult, if not 
impossible, to integrate them into its course. If they can be worked 
through, then this work must not confine itself to a recognition and 
acknowledgment of their murderous atrocities. What has to be worked 
through is the resistance against work and against working through, 
against the resistance that was there from its start and that determined 
its political theories as well as its praxis. The work of National 
Socialism--the work of the "redeemer," of "form" of "Being"--was 
determined from the outset to produce nothing: nothing but its self, 
nothing but the form of its being, nothing but the self, and thus 
<I>nothing.</I>
 It was work as the work of the extermination of work and 
as the 
<B></B>
 work of self-extermination.

Working through this work does not only mean mourning 
<I>over</I>
 the 
victims of the fascists and thus 
<I>for</I>
 the fascists--namely, instead 
of them--but also 
<I>over</I>
 and 
<I>for</I>
 us: to mourn over what in our 
work is mere integration, assimilation, appropriation, self-assertion, and 
self-production and not also alteration 
<I>("Veranderung"),</I>
 to mourn 
over what is merely work and not also what in work itself is not and never 
will be work. The ideology of work, still dominant today, its concealment 
in sociological theories of intersubjectivity or interdiscursivity, its 
systematic idealization and its practical tyranny, we ourselves, to the 
extent that we are subject to, or take part in, it--all belongs to what 
makes up the arsenal of resistance against the working through of 
fascistic systems of work. We cannot allow ourselves to be contented with 
any theory of work, of production, or of positing that repeats the old 
morpho- and ergontologisms, even if only implicity, in the guise of the 
new, without opening them through attention for the amorphic and 
anamorphic, the anergic, unstable, and destabilizing, for the workless and 
for those who strike. Working through has a chance only when work itself 
is worked through and opened to what is not work, which is never static 
form, state, or statue, and never pure performance or pure re. Under 
conditions other than those of the 
<I>anergon,</I>
 of 
<I>afformation</I>
and 
<I>afration</I>
 there is no other future.

After having written in "Leisure and Idleness" in 
<I>The Gay Science</I>
about the "breathless haste" of work as the proper "vice of the new 
world," Nietzsche continues--and has not only America but also Europe in 
mind: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Even now one is ashamed of resting, and prolonged reflection almost gives 
people a bad conscience. One thinks with a watch in one's hand, even as 
one eats one's midday meal while reading the latest news of the stock 
market; one lives as if one always "might miss out on something." . . . 
More and more, work enlists all good conscience on its side; the desire 
for joy already calls itself a "need to recuperate" and is beginning to be 
ashamed of itself. "One owes it to one's health"--that is what people say 
when they are caught on an excursion into the country. Soon we may well 
reach the point where people can no longer give in to the desire for a 
vita contemplativa (that is, taking a walk with ideas and friends) without 
self-contempt and a bad conscience.

Regardless of whatever else it might have been,National Socialism 
could be all that it was only because it was a system of work. 
International capitalsocialism, in this respect, does not lag behind. It 
is the perpetuation of that system with scarcely altered means. One will 
have to, when confronted with both--and we all are, with no exceptions, 
confronted with both--one will have to ask oneself what in the structure 
of work and in the joints, rifts, and rejects of its system permits of 
another work 
<B></B>
 and perhaps something other than work, 
to ask oneself what its 
<I>Parerga</I>
 and 
<I>Anerga</I>
 and what "taking 
a walk with ideas and friends" allows. One will have to inquire into a 
conduct and a language--and, doubtless, not only inquire--that do not 
work, that cannot be deployed as a means, and that serve neither those 
systems nor like systems to come. 
<p>
One will have to work in such a way that the work of fascism, the fascism 
of work, cannot live off it and continue to work. Otherwise, the talk 
about working off the past is a feeble reclamation--to whose address? It 
must, however, have a sense that does not allow itself to be dominated by 
this past--or by any of the other pasts--but, rather, one that lays it 
bare and renders it analyzable under the very sober light of a still 
unimaginable future and of what in this future is more and something other 
than future. 
<p>
One will have to work in such a way that one bids farewell to the heroic 
redemption and damnation schemes of mythic provenience, which always and 
always 
<I>still</I>
 ally themselves with the concept and experience of 
work (and, once more, with concept and experience 
<I>as</I>
 work). One 
will have to work in such a way that one goes thence where the heroism of 
redemption 
<I>("Erl&ouml;sung"),</I>
 of dissolution--the solution 
<I>("L&ouml;sung"),</I>
 "final solution" 
<I>("Endl&ouml;sung"),</I>
immanent to work and discourse--and the fatalism of damnation, of the 
cursed earth, of work as socage, as punishment and humiliation, depose 
<I>("aussetzen").</I>
<p>
Working through history always runs the risk of falling under the law of 
vengeance. It runs the risk thus of falling under the law of exchange, the 
quid pro quo, the symmetry of the tooth for a tooth and between one eye 
and another and 
<I>ergo </I>
under the law of the repetition and 
perpetuation of the past. If this working through is to have a chance of 
breaking free from the vicious circle of vengeance, then it must break 
free from the circle of work determined as vengeance. In this work, 
something more than work, something other than vengeance, and something, 
with respect to the past, new must occur. From this excess, this 
excendence, of work something suggests itself in the concept of working 
through: on the one hand, it indicates the traversal of a traumatic event 
and its transformation into a conscious experience. Thus it indicates that 
process in which what has remained unconscious or preconscious and what 
persists in the form of phantasmatic reproductions is revealed to 
consciousness and becomes available for processing 
<I>("Verarbeitung").</I>
 In this sense, working through concerns the 
repetition compulsion that threatens to block work. Work itself, however, 
can be subject to repetition compulsion and, consequently, can itself 
constitute a blockageto work and to working through. In the pure 
mechanics of obsessive activities, it can be the unconscious execution of 
a traumatic command, the subservient fulfillment of a dictatorial scheme, 
the always identical reproduction of an always identical injury and its 
defense. Working through would mean, then, making this anxiety and that 
injury accessible in a gradual process, gaining access to the 
inaccessible, 
<B></B>
 passing the impassable. On the other 
hand, however, "working through" must mean further that one works 
<I>through</I>
 ("
<I>hindurch</I>
arbeiten") that trauma and this 
over-and-over-again 
<I>retraumatizing</I>
 work, that one does not stick to 
the work on trauma and the trauma of work but, rather, that one can 
<I>pass through</I>
 and 
<I>over and above</I>
 its permanent restitution 
and reinstitution. This working through and working one's way out of work 
can no longer be achieved 
<I>by way</I>
 of work, according to its scheme, 
its concept, and its ideal. It must far more pass through this scheme, 
this concept, and this ideal and pass over and above it. It must, as 
working through, be more and something other than work. Or it must, in 
accord with its tendency, at very least go 
<I>at </I>
this more and this 
other, approach them. 
<p>
Prepared long in advance, totalitarianisms have made work a trauma. They 
have laid it to waste. The history of capitalist work, which culminated in 
the National Socialist, Fascist, and Stalinist economies of terror and 
which, 
<I>far from over,</I>
 continues in the politics of exploitation and 
self-exploitation in not only the "developed" but also and especially in 
"underdeveloped" countries--this history of work, in the establishment of 
its absolute, that is to say, murderous and suicidal standard, has reached 
its end. We are not living 
<I>after</I>
 the end of this history; we are 
living 
<I>at</I>
 its end. We are living--if we can simply call this 
"living"--on the 
<I>border</I>
 of history determined as work, in its 
<I>epoch&eacute;</I>
 more than its epoch: there, thus, where this history 
no longer simply makes progress but, rather, where the scheme of this 
history, its historicity, the scheme of work--sheer 
auto-performance--opens itself. In this opening, the possibility of an 
other history or of something other than "history," the possibility of an 
<I>other</I>
 work or of something other than work, announces itself. But 
this is not a promise. The promise belongs--albeit ambiguously--to the 
order of the history of work. This does not give cause to hope. Hopes are 
oriented toward the future, toward what is to come, toward what comes 
forth and, working, produces itself, or what through work is produced. We 
touch now on--and have already for some time, and perhaps have already as 
long as "there is" time--the end of "work-time" 
<I>("Arbeits-Zeit").</I>
We touch it (I merely note these two examples) with the hyperstable 
apparatuses and the machines produced by machines that remove themselves 
further and further from "human" labor and leave a breach there where this 
"human" labor was. We touch it, on the other hand, in the fact of the 
finitude of "natural" resources: both times, in that we touch the border 
of classical work and work materials and thus touch upon something out of 
work.

If the "re of the worker" constitutes a fusion in which the tendencies 
of the past join forces with the new instruments of technology in order to 
forge an autonomous type, or even the type of types, and if this re 
should represent a "destiny" whose historical emergence breaks through 
even history itself, then the question is, what does 
<I>not</I>
 fall under 
the precinct of the auto-morphosis, of this self-production of the 
re of work?

What does not show itself, what does not work its way out, what 
<I>is</I>
not, as work? 
<p>
What is the metahorizon of the horizon, the other side of the horizon, 
that gives contour to the re of the worker? It is first the other side 
of the horizon that makes it possible for this re to erect itself, but 
on this other side it falls. 
<p>
What is the space--
<I>is</I>
 it and is it 
<I>something</I>
--in which the 
worker sets up his workshop? 
<p>
What does not conform to this re, without, however, resisting it? And 
what resists it without itself being an object? 
<p>
And, is it, in general, a what, a something, that does not work there, or 
is a "nonmodalizable," a withholding that eludes all modalities, all types 
and manners, all forms and measures, all procedures and means? What 
relation does the 
<I>ammodel</I>
 entertain with the model? I shall 
translate to prevent misunderstandings: what relation does the 
<I>admodel</I>
 (the outer horizon that first gives way to the possibility 
of a model and, thus, is itself not a model, but an 
<I>admodel</I>
) 
entertain with the model? And, does it 
<I>entertain</I>
 a relation at all? 
Can this relation of relation and "irrelation" be

<I>ammodernization,</I>
of that event whose rhythm gives contour to particular historical epochs, 
modes, and res, to particular historical developments and concepts, 
and even to the concept of history as such, without itself assuming a 
historical form but not without taking something away from their form. 
<p>
The worker is the re of planetaryperformativity: in him it is 
no longer possible to separate reality from theater. He deploys himself, 
repeats himself, and changes himself: iteration and alteration dictate the 
ratio of the transformation of his re; they are his ration, his 
<I>morphosis.</I>
 By dint of its alteration, however, formation must 
always have at least one element that carries on its monstrousnonessence 
<I>("Unwesen"),</I>
 that does not let itself be reduced to 
form and to the process of formation. It must always have something 
unformed from which the form departs, something to which it owes itself 
and through which it is impeded. There must be at least this one element 
that is other than the form and other than the form of genesis of the 
form: an 
<I>afform,</I>
 an 
<I>afformative.</I>
 In it, the domain of the 
possible positing of forms is inaugurated--in this, it is an 
<I>ad-formative</I>
--and in it, the sovereign authority of this domain as 
well as each and every one of its manifestations, each and every one of 
its positings, is de-posed, suspended, disarrayed--in this, this 
<I>afformative</I>
 is an 
<I>a-formative.</I>
 In every 
<I>parergon</I>
 an 
<I>anergon,</I>
 in 
<I>morphosis</I>
 an 
<I>anamorphosis</I>
 or 
<B></B>
<I>amorphosis,</I>
 in every ration and transformation an 
ad-, an a-, an 
<I>afration,</I>
 must impart "itself." 
<p>
This 
<I>afration,</I>
 this 
<I>afformation,</I>
 which does not posit 
but ex-poses, is not something and "is" other than Being. 
<p>
The historian posturing as a border patrolman: he attempts to secure the 
borders between the past, the present, and the future, to regulate 
traffic, and will grant passage only to what can present its marks of 
identification and recognition. Hollywood did not invent the "time cop." 
He already existed as "history cop." Yet what comes to pass with that 
which smuggles itself in under another name, with a marked card, a marked 
mark? 
<I>What comes to pass with the passage itself?</I>
 Does it come to 
pass, or does it not? Where in history lies the counterpart to 
no-man's-land: no-man's-time? 
<p>
Since National Socialism, all concepts are ruins. They are not merely 
stigmatized, not merely damaged: they are rubble. This holds no less for 
the concept of the past than for the concept of recollection, no less for 
the concept of historical progress than for that of work. And it holds, 
moreover, for that of working through. Even for Freud, the ideal of 
working through lay in the cure and thus in the approximation of a 
condition of relative normalcy. This ideal of normalcy entertains too many 
close affinities to the norm implemented by the totalitarian regimes of 
this century not to have exhausted its viability. It can no longer serve 
as a means of orientation. We do, indeed, need criteria, but we do not 
have a single criterion at our disposal that would not be in ruins and not 
a single one that would not harbor the danger of becoming murderous. 
Idealizations are, indeed, structurally unavoidable, but every inherited 
and every imaginable idealization is monstrous. When in a book entitled 
<I>Representing the Holocaust</I>
 someone calls for the development of a 
"social ritual" that would make the work of mourning and the process of 
working through into an institution, when in the same context someone goes 
so far as to attribute a ritual dimension to historiography and ultimately 
asserts that a language adequate to Shoah depends "on ritual as well as 
aesthetic criteria," then one will certainly not be able to deny one's 
empathy with this hair-raising na&iuml;vet&eacute;. However, one will ask 
oneself with horror in what way the program of this aesthetic ritual 
should structurally differ from the program of exactly that ritual--that 
sacrificial ritual--whose working through it is meant to promote. 
The confusionism that here, with an appeal to the notorious ideal of 
critique and critical judgment, exhibits its distressing incapacity for 
critique would have to be understood, for better or for worse, as a 
symptom of the ambivalence of institutionalized ideals--including, of 
course, the ideal of critique. Every ritualization of working through 
would be exempted from working through. There is no "adequate" language 
for the mass murder of Jews, Communists, homosexuals, Gypsies, and the 
ill. There is no adequate concept and no adequate aesthetic form for that 
which could respond to the generalized terror under totalitarian regimes. 
There are only, once more, demolished concepts, ruined rituals, shattered 
forms of representation.
<B></B>
 The "aesthetic rituals" of 
which 
<I>Representing the Holocaust</I>
 dreams, would, of course, be just 
as harmless as they are na&iuml;ve if they were not in principle of a kind 
with the politics of belittlement, harmonization, standardization, and 
idealization-- of the idealization and aestheticization of the Holocaust. . . . 
<p>
It is also not enough to speak of the ruin of forms and their ruinous 
effects. One has to ask oneself what, exactly, remains of the standards, 
the ideals, the schemes of thought and action that organized 
totalitarianism, and one has to ask further what in the remains of the 
terror of work has been spared and may even be rescued from the danger of 
relapse. Little. The minimal structure of work: to relate to something 
other than it ever itself can become. 
<p>
The conceptual remainder that has survived work--and, accordingly, must 
have preceded its rule--this reef in the concept 
<I>(Riff im Begriff)</I>
on which the work of destruction and the self-destruction of work must 
founder, this that is undestructed and unprocessed (I am attempting to 
render this formal minimal structure of work more precise) is, in the 
first place, nothing but its unproductive surplus, its excess, its 
excendence out of the domain of positive, positing, and producing 
violence. This surplus, in any case, has the character of a transference 
<I>("&Uuml;bertragung")</I>
--not, of course, in the sense of a 
substitution of a past form, or its representation, with its "natural" or 
artificial surrogate, but rather a transference to an other that cannot be 
anticipated in a model or grasped according to the scheme of a form. In 
this transference that knows no transferential object, the scope of work 
(as well as, in particular, the scope of what can be called working 
through) is ripped open. In this transference without object and without 
end, without secure trajectory and without recourse, in this 
<I>exfert,</I>
 working takes place as the sheer project of relating to 
something or someone as yet--and always as yet--undetermined. Relating to 
an other, outside the field of work and irreducible to this field, 
transference--a trans-ference that is more than the carrying (the 
"ference") of something bearable, something tolerable or some gain--is 
exactly what remains of work: the play, the open rift in which it moves, 
and the absolute premise under which alone working and working through is 
possible. 
<p>
Freud's understanding of the psychoanalytic notion of working through has 
assumed this direction. Thus understood, working through is possible only 
in the open horizon of transference and relies in all its effects on this 
horizon and its possible opening. The resistance against working through 
is a resistance against transference, against addressing the other, 
against a course or a discourse where the speaking subject gives in to a 
movement in which it constitutes itself just as much as it deconstitutes 
itself. Working through is tranference. And just as working through is 
<I>above all</I>
 a working through virtually the entire complex of work, 
so the transference in question would be 
<I>above all</I>
 a carrying, a 
"ference" 
<I>("Tragen")</I>
 beyond every carrying. Its aim cannot be 
determined in any nominal unity, in any scheme of syntagmatization, or in 
any conventional performance. Since, however, in order to "suceed," every 
discursive movement, every transmission, every transference must 
<B></B>
 not only go above and beyond its objects and means but, at 
the same time, must also avail itself of certain means, objects, and 
addressees, a structurally unavoidable resistance brings itself to bear in 
the tranference against the transference and in working through against 
working through. The resistance to transference lies in that the 
transference is directed toward a particular object, a particular person, 
a form, a type, an ideal. The resistance to working through lies in 
working through itself whenever it follows a particular scheme of work 
with predetermined, schematic, conventionalized ends or contents.

In his "Direction de la cure," Lacan noted without further commentary: "le 
travail de transfert (Durcharbeiten)."

"Working through"--he 
translates it as perlaborer--designates for him simply the work of 
transference. In "Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage," where he 
confirms "c'est bien l&agrave; un travail" and not without irony recalls 
that one tends even to grant this work a certain "valeur formatrice" that 
in the end may succeed in producing a skilled worker, Lacan presents 
something like a formula of orientation for what happens in this work of 
transference. The subject, he writes, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
dans ce travail qu'il fait de la reconstruire [to reconstruct the 
imaginary work that is its being] pour un autre, il retrouve l'alienation 
fondamentale qui la lui a fait construire comme une autre, et qui l'a 
toujours destin&eacute;e &agrave; lui &ecirc;tre d&eacute;rob&eacute;e par 
un autre. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">

</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The work of the subject, its being and its ego, is constituted as an 
other. As an other it is rediscovered anew in its reconstruction for 
another--the analyst, and from the very beginning 
<I>("toujours"),</I>
 it, 
this subject, this other-than-itself, is destined 
<I>("destin&eacute;e")</I>
 to be taken away 
<I>by</I>
 an other. The play 
of the prepositions and genera of the other Lacan opens up in his formula 
of working through proceeds unproblematically as long as it is an issue of 
<I>"pour un autre"</I>
 and 
<I>"par un autre."</I>
 It becomes 
uncontrollable and completes the turn toward a play in which the player 
loses himself as soon as 
<I>"comme une autre"</I>
 is in question. For 
<I>as an other,</I>
 the work of the subject, the image by way of which 
this subject constructs its identity and out of which it makes a Being 
for, and by grace of, others--
<I>as</I>
 such an other the subject is both 
constructed and reconstructed. Yet, it would have to be reconstructed in 
such a way that the latter, 
<I>as an other,</I>
 in its turn offers itself 
<I>as an other</I>
 other--not, however, 
<I>as such</I>
 and not 
<I>as itself.</I>
 The space of working through and of the work of transference 
would have to be such that in it the 
<I>as an other</I>
 sets itself apart 
as an 
<I>other</I>
<I>other </I>
and detaches itself from the construction 
and its repetition in the reconstruction. It would have to be the space 
and the time-space of detachment and thus the opening up of a time and a 
space in the first place. It could not be the restituting and resaturating 
renewal of the construction of the subject 
<I>for others;</I>
 rather, it 
would have to be the ex-struction of this 
<I>for others</I>
 in an 
unconstructed and unconstructible time-space interval, in which it is for 
<I>other</I>
 others and perhaps for another 
<I>for,</I>
 other than 
<I>for</I>
 and other than 
<I>as.</I>
<B></B>
<p>
Thus it is said, in passing through Lacan's leading formula and presumably 
a bit beyond it, that the work of transference comes to pass as the 
release of 
<I>one</I>
 other from an 
<I>other</I>
 other, of one 
<I>as</I>
from an 
<I>other,</I>
 one 
<I>for</I>
 and one 
<I>from</I>
from an other 
<I>for</I>
 and 
<I>from.</I>
 It comes to pass, that is to 
say, as the work of a differential re-petition of the scheme of work and 
thus as the opening of a difference, of a time-space and a movement one 
could provisionally designate as 
<I>alteralteration:</I>
 the alteration of 
that relation to the other through which the subject constitutes itself 
and the alteration of that particular other that is built according to 
precisely the ratio of this relation. Within the margin of free play 
between a 
<I>for others</I>
 and an other 
<I>for others</I>
--and this 
margin of free play is not coextensive with the difference between Lacan's 
two 
<I>a</I>
s, the small and the large--occurswhat tranference, 
the work of transference and working through, designates. It takes place 
in this margin of free play, mind you, that opens up as an unoccupied 
field already 
<I>before</I>
 the constitution of subject and object, I and 
other, thus already 
<I>before</I>
 the labor of its fixation to a re, 
an ideal or a work. Thus, it offers itself as a space neither of work, 
idealization, or oeuvre. This interspace, then, should not to be 
misunderstood as the empty space of lost or absent objects, to which what 
Freud calls the "work of mourning" might apply. Nor should it be 
misunderstood as the space of displacement or substitution, by way of 
which what he calls "dream work" renders unconscious representations 
accessible to consciousness. Working through allows the mechanism and 
contents of dream work to become recognizable. It takes part in the work 
of mourning, but it cannot be reduced to it, providing that this work is 
not merely a question of the formation and reformation of subjects and 
objects but, rather, of precisely that domain in which it might have a 
chance, at all, of forming and transforming itself. Since, however, the 
imaginary, idealizing, forming, and fixating relation to the other is the 
work and 
<I>"oeuvre"</I>
 (as Lacan writes) of the subject and the subject 
as oeuvre, there could be no (as Lacan does 
<I>not</I>
 write) working 
through and no work of transference that would not in extremis launch 
itself as interruption 
<I>("Aussetzung")</I>
 and ex-position 
<I>("Ent-setzung")</I>
 of work and thus (I take up a word from Blanchot) 
as 
<I>"desoeuvrement."</I>
 For the sake of exactness--and, more still, of 
<I>exaction</I>
--working through would have to be thought--and, more than 
merely thought--experienced not as 
<I>"perlaboration"</I>
 (as Lacan 
translates it) but as 
<I>allaboration:</I>
 asthe opening up of 
possible work 
<I>(adlaborare)</I>
 in which the res of work and the 
work of ration areabandoned 
<I>("aussetzen")</I>
<I>(a-laborare).</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
And further, since it is first this 
traversal of work that gives way to a worklessness in work and also to the 
history-space and time-space of alteration--of 
<I>alteralteration</I>
--there is history first and only when the res 
of space, time, and history are worked open and off 
<I>("auf- und offengearbeitet"),</I>
 when they, as res of work, are also exposed to 
something other than work. There is no history without work, but there is 
no work without its--and perhaps endless--end (without an end that is not 
even 
<I>its</I>
 end). The "infinite analysis" of which Freud speaks in his 
later work, the infinite working through and transference, is the process 
in which this other history, this history no longer related to any re, 
any oeuvre, or any work, opens. That it can be nothing but infinite means 
also that its agents and 
<B></B>
 objects are finite. This 
concept of infinite analysis and of infinite transference needs to be won 
for politics. 
<p>
In his small study of 1914 "Remembering, Repeating, and Working Through," 
Freud hints, toward the end of his deliberations, how the change from one 
other to an 
<I>other</I>
 other, from the one addressee of speech to that 
other, might look, that change in theprocess of working through 
cannot do without. The hint is given far more 
<I>despite</I>
 than 
<I>by</I>
 Freud. It has the character of an anecdote and stands in his 
text without metapsychological commentary or theoretical formalization. In 
psychoanalytic work, Freud recalls, the process of "overcoming" 
<I>("&Uuml;berwindung")</I>
 resistances is initiated by naming them to the 
patient. But this "naming" does not itself immediately effect the removal 
of the resistances. The effect of the ineffectiveness of naming does not, 
however, show itself principally in the analysand but, rather, in the 
analyst, whose conception of the power of naming, interpreting, and 
analytic words is considerably compromised. Freud writes: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
I have often been asked to advise upon cases in which the doctor 
complained that he had pointed out his resistance to the patient and that 
nevertheless no change had set in; indeed, the resistance had become all 
the stronger, and the whole situation was more obscure than ever. The 
treatment seemed to make no headway. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
In this situation, it is 
thus the analyst who lodges complaint, he and not the patient who suffers. 
It is the analyst who needs an analyst and who turns to this 
<I>other</I>
analyst for advice. This almost inconspicuous turn in which the doctor 
steps out of the psychoanalytic situation in order to safeguard itfrom without, redefines not just the "situation" itself--it becomes a 
parasituation--but also the concept of work that can be performed in it. 
In this decisive phase--the phase to which Freud entrusted "the work which 
effects the greatest changes" ("RRW," 155) and in which it is precisely a 
question of working through resistances--the "situation" ceases to be the 
dialogical dyad in which an active analyst confronts a passive patient or 
an active patient confronts an attentive and understanding analyst and 
these two work together as a duo, reflecting their presentations one in 
the other (Freud says that the doctor puts the resistance before the 
analysand [
<I>"seinen Widerstand</I>
 vorgestellt"]), and define their 
work, however implicitly, as that of the pair, the reflexivity and 
specularity of a narcissism &agrave; deux. According to the expectations 
of the analyst, psychoanalytic work consists in the synthesis of 
representations 
<I>("Vorstellungen")</I>
 and must in every regard 
accommodate the ideal of cooperation if the analytic "pact" is not to be 
broken--which means, if the ego ideal of the analyst is not to be wounded. 
With the complaint of the analyst directed at another, at the analyst of 
the analyst, the dialogical dyad, the definition of work as normalization 
and idealization and the interpretation of the analysis as the work of 
identificatory naming, is left behind and abandoned in favor of a 
principally open, a no longer simply naming, a 
<I>transidealizing </I>
and 
virtually interminable 
<B></B>
 polylogical process. The 
condition of every transformation is a "trans" of formation as well as of 
form. The other, whose memory and speech are in the hands of the analyst, 
is himself refered to another, to an 
<I>other</I>
 other, the analyst is 
referred to an ana-analyst. With the introduction of the hyperbole 
of the addresses and representations of the other, with this hyperbole of 
the re of the specularly defined other, with this 
<I>alteralteration,</I>
 work itself sets out for an 
<I>other</I>
 work and 
something other than work: it ex-poses itself--stands still, stalls, seems 
"to make no headway." It abandons 
<I>(aussetzen)</I>
 the scheme of work 
that stipulates the instantaneous effectivity of the dialogical--or, 
equally, self-reflexive--word, turns to an other than 
<I>its</I>
 other and 
becomes working through. 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
"This gloomy foreboding," Freud continues, in his report on the complaint 
of the analyst that the treatment did not seem to be making any headway, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
this gloomy foreboding always proved mistaken. The treatment was as a rule 
progressing most satisfactorily. The analyst had merely forgotten that 
giving the resistance a name could not result in its immediate cessation. 
One must allow the patient time to become more conversant with this 
resistance with which he has now become acquainted, to 
<I>work through,</I>
 to overcome it, by continuing, in defiance of it, the 
analytic work according to the fundamental rule of analysis. Only when the 
resistance is at its height can the analyst, working in common with his 
patient, discover the repressed instinctual impulses which are feeding the 
resistance; and it is this kind of experience which convinces the patient 
of the existence and power of such impulses. The doctor has nothing else 
to do than to wait and let things take their course, a course which cannot 
be avoided nor always hastened. ["RRW," 135-36] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
"Allow time," "wait," "let things take their course"--this allowing, 
giving time, and waiting, this unavoidability and inaccessibility to the 
action of the analyst, characterizes an entirely new comportment in 
contrast to the analytic dialogue. For it distinguishes itself not by way 
of question and answer, action and reaction--and thus not by way of 
discursive interaction or interdiscursivity--but, rather, by way of an 
extraordinary inactivity, an actlessness and speech-actlessness, in which 
the analyst is no longer the addressee and conversation partner of the 
analysand but, rather, of an other analyst, a third or fourth or, in the 
end, uncountable one. It is an inactivity in which the analysand, in his 
turn, does nothing else but address his resistance--resistance, that is to 
say, delay, time given, the giving of time 
<I>("Lassen der Zeit").</I>
 He 
addresses thus that incalculable and chronometrically unlocatable 
<I>other</I>
 of the other and in him the withdrawal of the address, the 
ineffectiveness of the word, and the suspension of work. Working through 
is to submerge oneself in resistance, in the ex-positon 
<I>(Aussetzen)</I>
of work, in the allowing of time, in another beyond of a representable, 
definable, and measurable other. It happens where this other has no form 
but, rather, lets forms--of time, of space, of language or action--simply 
take their course. And it takes place thus, not in the time-space of 
res but in the rhythm of 
<I>afration,</I>
 as 
<I>anamorphosis</I>
and 
<I>amorphosis.</I>
 Not as action or speech-act, not as 
<B></B>
 work or the work of speech, in the precinct of interdiscursivity 
and its ideals but, rather, as the allowing of actions, works, 
performances: as 
<I>afformation,</I>
 as the speaking of not-speaking and 
the action of inaction.

Freud writes: "to immerse" oneself in resistance, "to work through, to 
overcome it." As its preparation by "immersion" and its continuation by 
"overcoming" shows, the concept of working through is coupled by him not 
only with the idea of a "through" but also with the idea of a "going 
through above and beyond" thus of a detachment from what, in the first 
place, must be traversed, of a perforation of resistance, which opposes 
itself to work (as the earth opposes itself to the mole insofar as it digs 
through the earth in order to enter, or exit, its hollow). Since 
idealizing--or, simply, conventionalizing--work accompanies working 
through, it is always work that constitutes a resistance to working 
through. However, work is not the first and final resistance. For since it 
is the form of the production of world consistency according to the ideals 
of discourse, it remains, in principle, susceptible to reworking in each 
and all of its posts. The resistance, which it is unable to adapt to its 
model, derives from the only field in which this form of production can 
possibly occur: from what, without itself being work, allows--and to some 
extent, necessitates--this work. 
<p>
If Adorno privileges the concept of "working off" 
<I>("Aufarbeitung"),</I>
then, surely, in order to place the accent on two semantic values that 
stand out from the conception of "overcoming" implicit in the concept of 
"working through," what must be "worked off" has not even been an object 
of work; it must be worked on retrospectively, like a trauma that strikes 
a body, psychical or political, so quickly that it has no time to mobilize 
its reserves, its defensive or integrative mechanisms. Moreover, in the 
"off " 
<I>(auf )</I>
 of "working off " 
<I>("Aufarbeiten"),</I>
 one can 
also hear "open" 
<I>("offen")</I>
 and, accordingly, understand "working 
off" as an opening 
<I>("&Ouml;ffnen"),</I>
 slackening, as the 
destabilization of a closed, contracted, monolithic complex, as a laying 
free by way of which what was and what still comprehends and arrests the 
present in the past is unlocked. As catching up 
<I>("Nacharbeiten"),</I>
working off 
<I>("Aufarbeiten")</I>
 operates the integration of the past 
and its remnants into the precinct of objectifying consciousness. As 
working open 
<I>("Offen-arbeiten"),</I>
 it goes over and above its 
idealizing, formative, and repressive borders. 
<p>
By way of its "paramorphemes"--through and off 
<I>("Durch und Auf")</I>
--working is absolved from its fixation to its auto-teleological, 
auto-eschatological, process. It does not refer to itself, to the ideal or 
the standard of the self determined as work, and, therefore, it cannot be 
trimmed back to the morphological scheme of self-reflexion, as Habermas, 
Hegelianizing, recommends in his (otherwise likable) reiteration of 
Adorno, "Was bedeutet 'Aufarbeiung der Vergangenheit' 
heute?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">

Working through and working off refer to something 
other than the self and 
<I>its</I>
 other; they refer, as all work ought, 
to an other that cannot be reduced to the self and its work and thus to 
the "re of the worker." In the work-break between our historical and 
our possible forms, as their possibility and their transformation into 
other forms and something 
<B></B>
 other than form, in forms 
that are no longer 
<I>ours</I>
 and perhaps no longer 
<I>forms,</I>
 we--or 
"we"--work 
<I>off</I>
 the form of work. 
<p>
Of the intellectuals who supported National Socialism with their theories 
and in their administrative functions, Heidegger is perhaps the only one 
in whose later writings one can read something of the working off of work 
here in question. The author of the sentence "Work is the presence of 
historial man" did not just change his mind and exchange his former 
opinion with a more accommodating, liberal-democratic one. Rather, he 
traced the implication of this sentence--that, namely, work is the essence 
of existence 
<I>("Dasein")</I>
--back to its ontological and, more 
precisely, techno-ontological tradition. When in "Zur Seinsfrage" (On the 
question of being) he points out to his former prompter, Ernst 
J&uuml;nger, that the metaphysics of work (which J&uuml;nger presents in 
<I>The Worker</I>
 with the subtitle 
<I>Form and Dominion</I>
) is nothing 
more than the thoroughgoing perpetuation of the metaphysics of the will to 
power, that"work" becomes identical with "Being," and that "Form" 
belongs essentially in thedomain of what Heidegger calls the 
<I>"Ge-Stell,"</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">

</SUP>
this is, on the one hand, nothing less 
than a massive critique of exactly that techno- and ergontology Heidegger 
advocated in 1934 in J&uuml;nger's and Hitler's entourage and, on the 
other hand, everything but an ingratiating gesture toward the doctrines of 
1955--for theirs was just this ideology of work. Heidegger undertakes the 
working off of the ontology of work--he prefers to speak of its 
<I>"Verwindung"</I>
--from the perspective of the history of Being, since 
for him it determines not the character of a particular historical 
political system but the character of the entirety of modern thought. The 
"Letter on Humanism" of 1946 leaves no doubt in its equivocal apology for 
Marxist materialism that also in it Heidegger sees a "destiny within the 
history of being" behind which the question concerning Being must reach: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
The essence of materialism does not consist in the assertion that 
everything is simply matter but rather in a metaphysical determination 
according to which every being appears as the material of labor. The 
modern metaphysical essence of labor is anticipated in Hegel's 
Phenomenology of Spirit as the self-establishing process of unconditioned 
production, which is the objectification of the actual, through man 
experienced as subjectivity. The essence of materialism is concealed in 
the essence of technology.

<p>
Thus, the essence of work, one could paraphrase, conceals itself in the 
essence of self-production, the unconditioned auto-performance that 
presents itself as subjectivity. With this sentence, Heidegger withdraws 
from the position he had assumed in the assertion--in the 
self-assertion--"Work is the presence of historical man." For work is no 
longer thought as self-presencing and self-execution but, for its part, as 
involved in a movement (Heidegger calls it, verbally, "essencing" 
<I>["Wesen"]</I>
) that is not absorbed in work and cannot be absorbed by 
it. From the thought on the essence of technology Heidegger can go on to 
the determination of work as 
<I>ekstasis</I>
<I>("Entr&uuml;cktheit")</I>
or "exposedness into being" 
<I>("Ausgesetzheit in das Seiende"),</I>
 which 
already in the 1934 Logic Lectures differed markedly from the 
J&uuml;ngerian doctrine of

the re of the worker.

It is this "ex-posedness"

 under the more precise name of "release" 
<I>("Gelassenheit")</I>
 and without the direction toward a domain of 
possible objectifications that allows for a resituation--and, in fact, 
de-situation--of work. In one of Heidegger's "field-path-conversations" 
<I>("Feldweg-Gespr&auml;che")</I>
 that dates from the end of the war, 
entitled "Evening conversation in a Prison Camp in Russia" 
("Abendgespr&auml;ch in einem Kriegsgefangenenlager in Ru&szlig;land"), 
work, in the context of acritique of nationalism and 
internationalism, is denounced as the form of a disastrous collective 
subjectivity: this subjectivity transacts the "business of devastation, 
that is, of work, on account of the heightened potential of 
work."

In the paragraphs headed "The Evaluation of Work" in 
<I>Mein Kampf,</I>
Hitler already in the 1920s follows the scheme of argumentation and 
suggestion integral to his address of May 1933, when he founds the 
differentiation between the "material" and "ideal" value of work in 
connection with a discussion of the "spiritual pliancy," the "spiritual 
levels" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 481), and "spiritual leadership" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 482), 
and in view of an "ideal Reich" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 487). The value of work is 
esteemed ideal where it is measured, mystico-naturalistically, both as a 
"offering of nature"--and thus of "birth"--and as gift of the "community 
of the people," and where this value as sacrifice is restored to the 
community and its nature, to this nature- and natal community. With the 
sacrifice of "ideal" work to its indigenous idea, to the "spirit" of the 
"community of the people," work departs from the domain of rationality, of 
isolation, and of contingency and enters the "Reich" of its necessity, 
organicity, and intimate communality. It is thus "essentially" a return to 
its origin, a return to its provenance, to its natural community, to 
itself and to its concept and, herein, "ideal," "spiritual." 
<p>
I shall cite a long passage from this complex of suggestions in which 
Hitler's rhetoric of naturalist ideality becomes apparent: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
Pure material value stands in opposition to that of the ideal. It does not 
rest on the significance of executed work measured materially but, rather, 
on its necessity in itself. [This] work goes on the account of its birth 
as well as on the thereby engendered formation ["Ausbildung"], which it 
receives from the people at large. . . . The form of the contribution [to 
the upkeep of the cultural community and state] is determined by nature; 
it falls to him merely to give back to the community of the people with 
diligence and uprightness what it itself has given him. Whoever does this 
merits the highest esteem ["Wertsch&auml;tzung"] and the highest respect . . . ; the ideal [wage], however, must lie in the esteem 
["Wertsch&auml;tzung"] to which all can lay claim who consecrate the 
strength nature endows and to which the community of the people gives form 
to the service of his nationhood. [Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf (Munich, 
1942), 483-84; my emphasis; hereafter abbreviated MK] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
From this nature-spiritual cycle, which work as "necessity in itself" runs 
through, issues its definition as sacrifice and the muddled formulation of 
"the will to sacrifice for the deployment of personal labor" (
<I>MK,</I>
235) "In him [the Aryan], the drive for self-preservation has achieved its 
most noble form in that he willfully subordinates his proper I to the life 
of the whole 
<I>["Gesamtheit"]</I>
 and, when the hour demands, sacrifices 
it." (
<I>MK,</I>
 326). "The most wonderful elucidation of this state of 
mind 
<I>["Gesinnung"]</I>
 is proffered by the word "work," which, for him, 
in no way designates the action of sustaining a livelihood but, rather, 
only a creating in harmony with the interests of the people" (
<I>MK,</I>
326). Precisely this "correct understanding of the concept of work" is, 
however, what "the Jew" is charged with lacking. In contrast to "the 
Aryan," for whom work is sacrifice to the natural idea of the community of 
the people, "the Jew" does not work. He gives nothing back and fails to 
receive himself in return--but, since he lacks every ethnic, and thus 
ethic, "ties" 
<I>["Bindung"],</I>
 his egotistical work is uncreative and 
robbery. Hitler's anti-Semitism establishes itself here as an 
anti-Semitism of work, of self-engenderment, of the nature-spiritual 
circulation of the sacrifice to one's proper people. "The" Jew does not 
dispose of the right, the altruistic, the ethnic, concept of work, because 
he (but who is, then, "he"?) does not dispose of any ethnicity, thus not 
of any nature or of any spirit.

"Being out of work," Heidegger says, "is therefore a spiritual 
<I>["seelische"]</I>
 disruption, because the lack of work leaves the 
<I>ekstasis</I>
 into things empty. 
<I>Ekstasis</I>
 is not a state of 
fitting in 
<I>("Eingef&uuml;gtsein").</I>
 Rather, it is an unfulfilled 
rapport with things in an enduring state of exposedness to beings," he 
claims in a fragmentary transcript of his Logic Lectures from the summer 
semester of 1934 (Martin Heidegger, 
<I>L&oacute;gica: Lecciones de M. Heidegger [semsetre verano 1934] en el legado de Helene Weiss,</I>
 ed. and 
trans. V&iacute;ctor Far&iacute;as [Madrid: Anthropos, 1991], 102; 
hereafter abbreviated 
<I>L</I>
). In this determination of work (naturally, 
given that this is based on a transcription, it should be taken with a 
grain of salt), there are three points worth noting:  Heidegger speaks 
here of a "
<I>spiritual</I>
 disruption"--in his existential-ontological 
deliberations on the concept of work, he thus does not hesitate to employ 
an anthropological and, more nearly, psychological concept of deficiency; 
 he determines unemployment 
<I>("Arbeitslosigkeit")</I>
 negatively as 
an "unfulfilled rapport with things," and characterizes them thus as a 
mere deficit of work;  while work, for its part, is determined as 
fulfillment of the thing-relation 
<I>("Dingbezug")</I>
 and, despite its 
"
<I>ekstatic</I>
 structure," as "fitted in" in beings. This is as much as 
to say that work should constitute just such a form of expropriation 
<I>("Ent&auml;u&szlig;erung")</I>
 by virtue of which Dasein fits itself 
into thingly being, accommodates itself to it and, at the same time, fills 
out its open site, its gap. The world of things is thus just as 
complementary as it itself, as reference and happening, is complemented by 
it. For Heidegger, work is thus the constitutive way by which Dasein 
arrives at its own consistency and the consistency of world: it is 
<I>consistation.</I>
 Accordingly, the pain that in Heidegger's late 
thought marks the proper experience in the ontological difference (cf. 
Martin Heidegger, "Die Sprache," in 
<I>Unterwegs zur Sprache</I>
), can 
here be characterized as only the deficit of just this experience, as the 
deficit of work: it is "an oblivious exposedness into beings, . . . pain"

In his Logic Lectures, Heidegger's determination of work stands in the 
context of the determinationof "determination": work 
<I>is</I>
 the 
privileged determination of determination, its determinateness. To the 
question, What does determination mean? Heidegger sets forth its 
"threefold meaning in originary unity." He places stress on the first as 
"determination to" and thus as "carried-forward for the mission" and 
thereupon continues: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
Our determination is our determinateness, that is, the regulation and 
training of our entire comportment toward that which is our commission. 
That is work. The work of historical man is not just any occupation. Work 
is the mission that, at any given time, has become a determination. It 
gathers our deeds in the given historical moment and brings it about. Work 
is the presence of historical man. Historical presence = work. Work is 
determination and mission, future and pastness. . . . Work and the 
present, they show themselves in performance ["Vollzug"], in the Now 
["Augenblick"]. [L, 78-80] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Of this manifold of the determinations of work, I underline only two 
aspects. On the one hand, work is located on themedian between 
pastand future, tradition and project, commission and mission, and 
thus exactly on that systematic site that in 
<I>Being and Time</I>
 is 
occupied by the Now--that is always the moment of decision for the (at any 
given time) proper possibilities of Dasein. And, on the other hand, just 
as this Now is the historical present, so work is pure "performance" 
<I>("Vollzug")</I>
 (that is, decision and, thereby, the determination of 
determination): it is the median of time and the median of history as pure 
perfomance. When Heidegger in the same context designates time as "the 
great and only junction 
<I>["Fuge"]</I>
 of our being as something 
historical," and when this junction is prescribed 
<I>("verf&uuml;gt")</I>
by work, then time is junction and enactment of work as a performance in 
the fullness of which nothing lacks and which itself, unlike in the 
"Dictum of Anaximander" (
<I>Spruch des Anaximander</I>
 from 1946) knows no 
gap 
<I>("Un-fuge"):</I>
 no gap, no void, no worklessness 
<I>("Arbeits-losigkeit"),</I>
 and no interruption of performance. 
<p>
After a dreadful discussion about the alliance of "blood" and "mood" 
<I>("Gebl&uuml;t und Gem&uuml;t"),</I>
 Heidegger prudently continues, 
concerning 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
a fundamental human disposition[:] . . . to this belongs the 
determinateness of our Dasein through work. Work = presence. The present 
is not what happens now, but is the present insofar as it transposes our 
Being into the appropriate liberation of beings themselves. As a worker, 
man is taken outside itself ["entr&uuml;ckt"] in the openness of beings. 
This ekstasis ["Entr&uuml;ckung"] belongs to the essence of our Being, 
namely as being ex-posed into the openness of beings. [L, 102] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
In this further determination of the determination that is work, its 
character as dislocation (
<I>"Versetzung";</I>
 elsewhere it is called 
"ex-posedness" 
<I>["Ausgesetztheit"]</I>
) and 
<I>ekstasis</I>
 warrant 
emphasis as precisely that feature in which work is 
<I>open</I>
 to 
something other than proper Dasein or to this Dasein as a possible other. 
But this movement of opening, which even in this lecture Heidegger does 
not relinquish to the ideology of Nazism, is massively curtailed as soon 
as the reference to this other, to this openness, is defined as "a 
liberation of beings in a manner appropriate to work" 
<I>("werkgerechte Befreiung").</I>
 The "liberation"thus already stands under the 
guardianship of the work. The opening is already one of the modalities 
according to which Dasein as work closes ranks with itself. Only in this 
way does work = presence. Only in this way does "the making-present of 
beings," as Heidegger writes, happen in it. Only in this way doescoming-to-being 
<I>("Anwesen")</I>
 = making and, thereby, once more, 
does coming-into-being = auto-performance
<B>. </B>
No strike interrupts the 
essence of this work; no pain of unemployment darkens the joy of 
self-effectuation. "Therefore," Heidegger writes, "the question of the 
<I>joy of work</I>
 is important. Joy as a fundamental mood is the ground 
of the possibility of genuine work." (
<I>L,</I>
 102) With this postulate, 
Heidegger's fundamental ergontology succeeds not only in linking up with 
Henri de Man's psychology of labor, 
<I>The Struggle for the Joy of Work</I>
 , but also with that Nazi slogan that promises "Strength 
through joy" 
<I>(Kraft durch Freude).</I>

The concept "onto-typo-logy" used by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe (see his 
"Typographie," in 
<I>Mimesis des Articulation</I>
 [Paris: 
Aubier-Flammerion, 1975]) does not adequately account for the 
J&uuml;ngerian construction. Lacoue-Labarthe orients himself on 
Heidegger's answer to J&uuml;nger in "Zur Seinsfrage." Lacoue-Labarthe 
paraphrases its deliberation and follows it in tracing J&uuml;nger's 
"type" 
<I>("Typus")</I>
 back to the platonic 
<I>eidos</I>
 and "idea." This 
last move enables him to situate the origin of J&uuml;nger's "type" in the 
"typos" of the 
<I>eidos</I>
 and "idea" and to infer the ontotypological 
constitution of ontology in general. Whatever this constitution may be, 
the "Being" of the "re" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 is thought by J&uuml;nger, 
in the wake of Goethe's morphology, as "re." The "type" is merely its 
embodiment or representation. Thus I use here the concept "morphontology" 
or 
<I>ontomorphologie,</I>
 in order to designate J&uuml;nger's most 
fundamental notion.

In 1945, Hitler consciously and systematically practiced, as is well

the formula of its system in the opening pages of 
<I>The Worker.</I>
 He 
writes there of the "motor," the symbol of our times: "It is the audacious 
plaything of a breed of men that can blast itself into the air and still 
glimpse in this act confirmation of order" (

calls this "posture" 
<I>("Haltung"),</I>
 which is a "blast"

 "heroic realism." But just as J&uuml;nger's 
objectivity is that of the 
<I>universalia in re,</I>
 so is his "heroic 
realism" without risk, since he can always trust that, in the event of a 
loss of reality, he would still gain its concrete universal: a "nothing" 
that serves to confirm "Being."

 rewritten or reworked. The translator 
renders the sentence in the English edition as follows: "For in this labor 
which he [the subject] undertakes to reconstruct

rediscovers the fundamental alienation that made him construct it 
<I>like another,</I>
 and which has always destined it to be taken from him

This word formation, as one says rather appropriately in English, 
"doesn't quite work." It doesn't "function" properly, just as most of the 
"words" in 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
 do not "function" "properly" yet allow 
something to happen for precisely that reason. In Latin, the word 
<I>allabor</I>
 does not exist, though 
<I>allaborare</I>
 (working, 
striving, toward something) does. 
<I>Allabere,</I>
 a derivation of 
<I>lapsus,</I>
 on the other hand, exists in the sense of "to slide toward, 
land, and unintentionally end up somewhere." Likewise, 
<I>labor</I>
 means 
"I slide, swing, fall, sink," just as the homophone 
<I>labor</I>

<I>Louis-Ferdinand C&eacute;line confounds the paradigm for fascist writers. A doctor for the poor with clear populist tendencies who emerged on the literary scene from out of nowhere, he produced a runaway best-seller,</I>
 Voyage au bout de la nuit 
<I>(Journey to the End of the Night) , then a misunderstood bildungsroman,</I>
 Mort &agrave; 
cr&eacute;dit 
<I>(Death on the Installment Plan) , that revolutionized the look of written French and exploded narrative convention. In the late 1930s he published two anti-Semitic pamphlets (</I>
Bagatelles pour un massacre 
<I>[Trifles for a massacre] and</I>
L'&Eacute;cole des cadavres 
<I>[School for corpses]), both wildly successful, that pushed back the envelope of acceptable hate speech. In occupied France, he wrote letters to the editors of collaborationist newspapers and was identified with the racial policies of Vichy, but he was inconsistent and fairly useless as a polemicist for the "new order," since his spleen turned against Vichy as well its enemies. Nonetheless his camp was chosen: he was the writer who had passionately demanded the extermination of the Jews. At the end of the war he fled, following the Vichy government to the castle town of Sigmaringen, then to Denmark, where he was imprisoned by the Danes and released into exile. He was not extradited back to France during the early days of the purge, when collaborators such as Robert Brasillach were being condemned to death. By the time C&eacute;line stood trial, in absentia, the fury days of the purge had ended. Amnestied in 1951 as a veteran of World War I, he returned to a semireclusive life in the Paris suburb of Meudon, where he penned a trilogy of novels about the immediate</I>
<B></B>
<I> postwar moment, featuring a shattered Europe and a paranoid, misunderstood, and wildly comic narrator. His novels (but obviously not his complete works) have been edited in the prestigious "Pl&eacute;iade Collection"; his work appears on the French state</I>
 agr&eacute;gation 
<I>examination, which certifies teachers of literature at the highest level. He is generally acknowledged, along with Marcel Proust (perhaps as an anti-Proust, in terms of class and syntax), as the great literary innovator of the century. C&eacute;line's pamphlets, according to the wishes of his widow, have not been reedited since the war; pirate versions have been seized by his estate. There is currently a debate in France about whether or not his pamphlets should be reedited; whether, on the one hand, there is enough "C&eacute;line" in them to make them valuable as literary objects, or, on the other hand, whether it isn't dangerous, in a current French climate of escalating racism and electoral successes by Le Pen's Front National, to make this writer's hate speech available to a public who reads him as great literature.</I>
<p>
<I>C&eacute;line has red in the American literary context at least since the early 1930s; the story of his American reception runs along not quite parallel tracks to the French story, with some fascinating differences. This essay concentrates on one part of the American picture: C&eacute;line's reception among writers.</I>

<B>The Miller Paradigm</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
Georges Brassa&iuml;, in a memoir entitled 
<I>Henry Miller: grandeur nature</I>
 (Henry Miller: lifesize), tells the following, now famous 
story: Henry Miller was living in Paris in 1932 and struggling with the 
manuscript of 
<I>Tropic of Cancer,</I>
 which had already been rejected by 
publishers. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">
1</A>
</SUP>
An agent connected with the French publishing 
firm of Deno&euml;l and Steele gave Miller galley proofs of 
Louis-Ferdinand C&eacute;line's 
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit.</I>
 This was 
Frank Dobo, also of the Winkler International Literary Agency, the agent 
who would help sell and promote the English version of C&eacute;line's 
first novel with Little, Brown and Company, and who was soon after to 
become deeply involved in Miller's literary career. According to 
Brassa&iuml;, reading C&eacute;line so affected Miller that he rewrote 
<I>Tropic of Cancer.</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">
2</A>
</SUP>
Miller told Brassa&iuml; that "no 
writer had ever given him such a shock"; Brassa&iuml; went so far as to 
claim that Miller moved to the working-class suburb of Clichy to be near 
C&eacute;line--a strange claim, since C&eacute;line never lived in Clichy, 
although he consulted at the medical clinic there. 
<p>
It is no coincidence that Brassa&iuml;, who with novelist Pierre MacOrlan 
was identified with 1930s Montmartre-Montparnasse bohemianism, and who 
prowled Paris by night with Henry Miller as he prepared his famous photo 
essay 
<I>Paris by Night,</I>
 should be fascinated by Miller's attraction 
to the author of 
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit.</I>
 Whether or not the 
story, as Brassa&iuml; told it, is literally true, we know that Miller 
sent 
<I>Tropic</I>
 to C&eacute;line, that he championed C&eacute;line 
throughout his career, calling him his "brother" and a "great man," and 
that he signed an American petition in his defense when C&eacute;line was 
threatened with extradition on charges of collaboration. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
The 
"shock" that Miller is said to have felt upon reading C&eacute;line had a 
positive and long-lasting 
<B></B>
 effect. Samuel Putnam, a 
translator of Rabelais who was also closely linked to Miller through their 
shared Paris expatriate scene (Putnam would employ Miller at his literary 
magazine, 
<I>The New Review</I>
) used the word "shock" in a different 
register in his 1934 review of the American edition of the English 
translation of 
<I>Journey to the End of the Night:</I>
 "It is safe to 
wager that nine out of ten non-French French teachers in America would be 
unable to make head or tail out of the original, while the French-born 
ones would be terribly shocked, linguistically as well as 
morally." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">
4</A>
</SUP>
The difference between the academic and the 
artistic response is clearly marked here: Henry Miller's discovery of 
C&eacute;line's 
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit,</I>
 as related by Georges 
Brassa&iuml;, establishes a distinct relationship to C&eacute;line on the 
part of American authors, showing C&eacute;line en route to becoming a 
writer for writers. 
<p>
The fact that Miller first read C&eacute;line in the original French is 
not to be overestimated in accounting for the impact C&eacute;line had on 
him. Many critics, including Putnam, acknowledged in the 1930s that John 
Marks's translations of C&eacute;line were inferior to the original in 
tone, in addition to being expurgated. At Little, Brown, the telegram that 
editor Herbert Jenkins sent to the Boston branch, listing the phrases that 
Marks had cut, was hung on the wall as a reminder of the scandal that 
<I>Journey</I>
 constituted for the American reading public in 
1934. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">
5</A>
</SUP>
It is astonishing that we had to wait until 1983 for 
Ralph Manheim's translation of 
<I>Journey.</I>
 By then, C&eacute;line's 
American reputation had waned considerably. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>American Moments</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
Under the impetus of the New Directions 1947 reprint of 
<I>Death on the Installment Plan,</I>
<I>Journey to the End of the Night</I>
 in 1949, and 
the 1954 publication of 
<I>Guignol's Band</I>
 in English, the circle of 
American-based writers interested in C&eacute;line expanded. For 
understanding the constellation of references and positions that 
accompanied the American taste for C&eacute;line during the 1950s, there 
is no more representative re than Kenneth Rexroth, the New Directions 
author and critic who, in a series of articles on poetry, the Beat 
Generation, and literary rebellion, consistently used C&eacute;line as a 
counterpoint to the "polite" American writers, critics, and poets he 
dubbed the "Reactionary Generation." The paradox is that a writer like 
C&eacute;line, in the American context, shows up as an aesthetic 
alternative to writers who, like him, in the European context are situated 
on the reactionary Right. T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound represented for the 
anarchist Rexroth the very essence of orthodoxy, crowned by a New Critical 
formalism for which he reserved his wittiest contempt: "there was growing 
up in Vanderbilt University, one of the few institutions of learning in 
the American South, a little coterie of political reactionaries, under the 
leadership of their English professor, John Crowe Ransom. . . . Their idol 
was T. S. Eliot, Classicist, Anglo-Catholic, Royalist. . . . They approved 
of Ezra Pound but wished he paid more attention to the rules of 
verse." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
At the other end of Rexroth's spectrum was Allen 
Ginsberg, with his "denunciatory" jeremiad 
<I>Howl,</I>
 representing "an 
almost 
<B></B>
 perfect fulfillment of the long, [Walt] 
Whitman, Populist, social revolutionary tradition in American 
poetry." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs set out to visit C&eacute;line in 
Meudon in 1958. (It is generally thought that Burroughs learned of 
C&eacute;line through Miller as early as 1944 and transmitted his 
knowledge to the younger Beats, Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac.) In the volume 
of poems that Ginsberg began writing in Paris that same year--entitled 
<I>Kaddish,</I>
 after the Jewish mourner's prayer--C&eacute;line appears 
with a host of other writers--Whitman, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Blake, Charles Dickens, William Carlos 
Williams, Arthur Rimbaud (C&eacute;line and Rimbaud are the only French 
writers mentioned)--in a poem called "Ignu." He is portrayed in his 
decrepit Meudon persona, administering morphine: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
C&eacute;line himself an old ignu over prose
<BR>
I saw him in Paris dirty old gentleman of ratty talk
<BR>
with longhaired cough three wormy sweaters round his neck

<BR>
"because they were all getting emotional" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The physical description corresponds to the person Ginsberg and Burroughs 
must have seen at Meudon--decrepit, ill, covered in sweaters in an 
unheated house. The elements of C&eacute;line's first two novels are 
suggested as well: the gathering of crowds, the ship, C&eacute;line's 
medical practice. The gift of morphine in "Ignu" is much closer to a 
Burroughs fantasy (Burroughs had published 
<I>Junkie</I>
 in 1953, and he 
presented a copy of the book to C&eacute;line) than to any dominant aspect 
of C&eacute;line's prose, and shows how C&eacute;line's aura could be 
appropriated. In the mid-1960s, Ginsberg would acknowledge the influence 
of C&eacute;line on his poetry in technical, rather than thematic, terms: 
"the rapidity of transitions and shiftings made possible by the 3dot 
syntax . . . that's what impresses us in US who are interested in the use 
of aural speech patterns transferred to written language." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">
9</A>
</SUP>
<p>
That the C&eacute;line celebrated by the Beats was a sentence-level writer 
was no doubt part of the decision made by New Directions to underwrite a 
new translation of one of the French writer's previously translated novels 
during the 1960s. In 1966, they published Ralph Manheim's translation of 
<I>Mort &agrave; cr&eacute;dit,</I>
<I>Death on the Installment Plan,</I>
which rendered C&eacute;line in a style that was more syntactically 
interesting, and more American in terms of vocabulary than the earlier, 
British-idiom translations by John Marks. Manheim's work is more attuned 
to the qualities that Ginsberg valued in C&eacute;line's writing: the odd 
speech patterns and the three dots, which were often ignored or 
"corrected" in Marks's translations. This was the first of the decade's 
several major publishing events in the American career of C&eacute;line: 
in 1968, Manheim's translation of 
<I>D'un chateau l'autre,</I>
<I>Castle to Castle,</I>
 won a National Book Award for 
<B></B>
translation, boosting the visibility and prestige of C&eacute;line's 
post-World War II historical fiction. 
<p>
In 1965, C&eacute;line made a significant appearance in Bruce Jay 
Friedman's anthology of short stories, 
<I>Black Humor.</I>
 C&eacute;line 
is represented in the volume by the Admiral Bragueton episode from 
<I>Journey to the End of the Night.</I>
 He is the only French writer, 
appearing alongside Thomas Pynchon, Joseph Heller, John Barth, Terry 
Southern, and J. P. Donleavy. The essay in which Friedman introduces the 
black humor genre is political and aesthetic in focus; black humor, 
Friedman argues, is the only possible literary response to the mad reality 
of the Vietnam war, and C&eacute;line was the precursor of this angry, 
hallucinatory genre: "There is Thomas Pynchon appearing out of nowhere 
with a vision so contemporary it makes your nose bleed and there is 
C&eacute;line who reminds you that he thought all your thoughts, worked 
the same beat, was dumbfounded as many times a day as you are, long before 
you were born." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">

<p>
It was in the 1960s that Kurt Vonnegut, author of 
<I>Slaughterhouse-Five;</I>
 John Clellon Holmes, the chronicler of the 
Beat Generation who became a teacher of fiction writing; and Philip Roth, 
the young Jewish author of the infamous 
<I>Portnoy's Complaint,</I>
 all 
taught C&eacute;line in fiction courses at the Iowa Writers' 
Workshop. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">

</SUP>
The appearance of C&eacute;line as an antiwar 
writer in Vonnegut's 
<I>Slaughterhouse-Five</I>
 , the dominant theme 
of which is a critique of the bombing of Dresden and whose success was 
overdetermined by protests against the American bombings of Vietnam in the 
1960s and 1970s, presented the French writer to a mass of American 
readers as an antiwar re at a time when opposition to the Vietnam War 
was becoming a mass movement. If the 1950s was the decade when 
C&eacute;line's reputation was expanding among writers and critics 
connected to the Beat Generation, the 1960s--with C&eacute;line's 
canonization as a black humorist, the impact of the new Manheim 
translations, and the interest in his work shown by such mainstream 
novelists as Vonnegut and Roth--was the decade when C&eacute;line came 
closest to reaching a mass American audience--when C&eacute;line was 
reinvented as an antiwar novelist. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>The Survey</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
In 1991, I undertook a survey of contemporary American writers. It was an 
attempt to document an afterlife for C&eacute;line--a life after the 
oppositional cultural movements of the 1960s, after the waning of 
avant-garde writing. The angry young men have been replaced as the most 
celebrated res on the literary scene by women and minorities, and 
first-person narrative has attained a decidedly more confessional, less 
hallucinatory quality than it had thirty years ago. I wanted to know: Is 
C&eacute;line remembered? Is he still a writer's writer? Who is reading 
him today? 
<p>
The idea of asking a group of contemporary writers about a literary re 
is an almost shockingly simple approach to questions of intertextuality 
and influence that have received sophisticated theoretical treatment. A 
survey cannot capture effects that are unconscious, repressed, or even 
indirect, but it can provide writers with a 
<B></B>
 chance 
to give testimony--to create a text of their own. It is this "text"--the 
collective written responses to my questions on C&eacute;line--that I 
analyzed for patterns, repetitions, and surprises. 
<p>
The empiricism of a survey was bound to antagonize a group of people who 
define themselves by their creativity. Asking writers to respond to 
yes-or-no questions is a bit like asking artists to complete a 
paint-by-numbers landscape. As I compiled the list of writers and later 
grappled with their answers, more often than not the survey came to seem 
rather like one of the experiments carried out by French writers of the 
twentieth-century OuLiPo school, which wants to formulate elaborate rules 
and mathematical structures as the bases for literary creation. My survey 
was a constraint, a mold, an opening into literary history that the 
writers could follow, resist, or ignore, as they pleased. 
<p>
Among the thousands of writers producing in the United States today, I 
chose to survey novelists, poets, and translators. I included editors who 
have shaped some of the most interesting writing of the past twenty years 
and essayists who, in my opinion, have left the scholarly domain to reach 
an audience outside the university through large-circulation literary 
magazines such as 
<I>The New York Review of Books</I>
 and 
<I>The New Yorker.</I>
 I chose individual writers for a variety of reasons: some had 
written or had spoken about C&eacute;line in interviews; others wrote in a 
genre or style favored by C&eacute;line; some writers were surveyed simply 
because I thought they would respond vehemently. At the same time, I aimed 
for a representative sample from various schools and tendencies in 
American writing: New Directions writers, Language poets, mainstream Knopf 
and Random House writers, writers born after 1950, and writers closely 
identified by their race, ethnicity, or sexual politics. The oldest writer 
to whom I sent the survey was born in 1897; the youngest, in 1964. The 
majority of writers who responded were born between 1927 and 1951, 
although there was a cluster of responses from writers born between 1909 
and 1917, who came of age during the 1930s, when C&eacute;line's American 
star first rose (
<A HREF="3.1kaplan_1.html">
 1</A>
). My basic source 
for writers' addresses was 
<I>The Writers Directory, 1990-1992,</I>
 although finding the right 
address was still not easy, and ten surveys never reached their 
destination. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">

</SUP>
<p>
What do I mean by "writer"? The distinctions between writers and critics, 
between producers and analysts of literature, are not always clear, 
especially today when for economic and institutional reasons American 
writers often make a living by teaching criticism and creative writing in 
university English departments and in writing programs. This is a 
characteristic of American writers today that distinguishes them both from 
C&eacute;line, who always defined himself 
<I>against</I>
 literary and 
academic communities, and from contemporary French writers who are not 
institutionally linked to the French university system. Even Ginsberg, who 
was indicted on obscenity charges in 1957 for 
<I>Howl,</I>
 today teaches 
writing at Brooklyn College; Maxine Hong Kingston, the best-known 
Asian-American novelist in the United States, is a distinguished professor 
at Berkeley; and John Barth, known for his metafiction, holds an endowed 
professorship at Johns Hopkins. Very few of the writers surveyed are 
<B></B>
[
<A HREF="3.1kaplan_1.html">
 1</A>
] 
<B></B>
 completely independent of the academic world: 
either they teach, write criticism for academic journals, or depend on 
income from speaking engagements at universities.

I sent the survey to 163 writers. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">

</SUP>
I received 65 responses, 
including completed surveys, letters, and one postcard, which constituted 
a response rate of 40 percent--unusually high for this kind of survey (10 
percent is considered a very good response rate to any kind of direct 
mailing). I was struck by the generosity of the respondents, both in 
answering my questions and in suggesting more complex ones than I had 
asked. 
<p>
Of the 65 respondents, 55 had heard of C&eacute;line, of whom 43 had read 
him; 12 people who hadn't read C&eacute;line took the trouble to return 
the survey. Fourteen respondents asked to be quoted anonymously. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>What Texts Have You Read?</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
I asked writers to check off the works by C&eacute;line they had read; 
these included the French editions of his novels and 
anti-Semitic/political pamphlets, and the English translations of his 
novels by John Marks and by Ralph Manheim. 
<p>
An equal number of writers  had read 
<I>Death on the Installment Plan</I>
 in the Marks and Manheim translations. The res, however, 
tilted toward Marks for 
<I>Journey</I>
 (34 people had read his 
translation, while 13 had read Manheim's). More writers, that is, had read 
<I>Journey</I>
 before 1983, when the Manheim translation was first 
published. 
<p>
The C&eacute;line work most frequently read by the American writers 
surveyed was Marks's translation of 
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit,</I>
 the 
only translation available from 1934 to 1983. The same number of people 
who had read the Manheim translation  read 
<I>Voyage</I>
 in the 
original French. The fact that Manheim's translation appeared so long 
after the publication of 
<I>Voyage</I>
 is an important factor here. The 
ages of the 
<I>Voyage</I>
 readers ranged from 52 to 81, indicating that an 
older generation of American writers was more likely to have read novels 
in French than those born after 1945. One surprising result was that 9 of 
the 13 readers who read 
<I>Voyage</I>
 in French also read it in English as 
<I>Journey:</I>
 either they read the book twice, once in French and once 
in English, or they used one of the English translations as a guide in 
reading the French--an indication not only of their dedication as readers, 
but also of the specific appeal, and difficulty, of C&eacute;line's 
French. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>Discovering C&eacute;line</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
C&eacute;line is an antiacademic re who nonetheless requires an 
educated taste. His work is transmitted in this country mainly through 
schools. Eleven writers had read C&eacute;line for the first time in 
college, either in a course or because friends had recommended his work. 
Five respondents precociously read him in high school or as 
<B></B>
 teenagers, 1 in a graduate seminar, and 1 in a writer's 
workshop--only 2 of the writers surveyed had first encountered him as book 
reviewers. 
<p>
There were a number of writers who reported reading C&eacute;line as their 
first intense brush with literature (the experience that readers often 
recall with respect to J. D. Salinger or Rimbaud). The poet and translator 
Richard Howard, who has read a great deal of C&eacute;line, discovered him 
in high school--in Cleveland, where "a sort of diabolic aureole surrounded 
this antisemitic re." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">
14</A>
</SUP>
Novelist Jim Harrison also first 
read C&eacute;line "in high school, a rural agricultural school where my 
teacher subscribed to the 
<I>Nation</I>
 and 
<I>Saturday Review</I>
 so I 
found out early about C&eacute;line." Gary Indiana "first read 
C&eacute;line precociously, at age 13 or 14, because his books were 
available in paperback at the local news store: I liked the titles." If we 
date these high-school encounters to 1945, 1953, and 1963 respectively, we 
have evidence of a C&eacute;line influence on young people extending over 
three decades, from the period of his greatest infamy--the immediate 
aftermath of the war--to the decade of his most obvious influence, yet 
before the appearance of the first Manheim translation in 1966. 
<p>
In addition to these high-school readers, the following writers (
<A 
HREF="3.1kaplan_2.html">
 2</A>
) 
reported specific years for their first "awareness" of C&eacute;line (they 
are listed by order of birth year). 
<B></B>
 Norman O. Brown (b. 1913) wrote a particularly interesting response to 
this question in a letter describing two different discoveries of 
C&eacute;line, fifty years apart. His initial encounter occurred 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
in my first Marxist incarnation in the late 1930s . . . as a "muck-raker," 
with ambiguous proletarian affinities. [Then] in the past year [1990] I 
discovered as more relevant to my post-Marxist tendencies Kristeva's 
Pouvoirs de l'horreur [Powers of horror]. . . . the material was so 
fascinating I went to the French edition and read it bilingually, paying 
special attention to the quotations from C&eacute;line. Thus through 
Kristeva in bilingual translation I got some access to C&eacute;line in 
the original. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Only 2 writers (not counting Brown) mention French sources--either 
personal or literary--for their first encounter with C&eacute;line: 
overwhelmingly, then, his reputation seems to have depended on word of 
mouth within an American network. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>Placing C&eacute;line</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
I asked, "Where do you place C&eacute;line (list other comparable authors, 
give a value judgment or a description): (a) in terms of French 
Literature; (b) in terms of American 
<B></B>
 literature; 
(c) along with other translated European authors?" The results were 
eclectic; some writers placed C&eacute;line among the timeless classics, 
others with nineteenth-century novelists, with his contemporaries in the 
1930s, or with writers working today. There was no discernible pattern of 
generational affinity in these comparisons: Jay McInerney (b. 1955), sees 
C&eacute;line as someone who "made the Beat Movement possible," while Ted 
Morgan (b. 1932), compares him to Eric Bogosian, the 1990s performance 
artist. C&eacute;line is poet Philip Levine's "favorite French writer of 
this century," whom he prefers to Andr&eacute; Gide, Proust, and 
Andr&eacute; Malraux. Richard Howard calls C&eacute;line one of the "three 
greatest prose writers of the Second World War period," along with 
Andr&eacute; Breton and Maurice Blanchot. 
<p>
In terms of American placement, Henry Miller was the most frequently cited 
in comparison with C&eacute;line (6 times); Norman Mailer, William 
Burroughs, and the Beats were each cited 3 times, while John Hawkes, Ray 
Federman, Vonnegut, Pound, Harold Brodkey, and John Dos Passos were each 
mentioned twice. Clark Blaise defined C&eacute;line as a "proletarian 
lyric writer," along with Henry Roth, Edward Dahlberg, early James 
Farrell, Dos Passos, and William Saroyan (Nathaniel West was also 
mentioned). A number of writers chose to respond to this question in the 
"not as good as" mode--that is, evaluatively. According to Ron Sukenick, 
"C&eacute;line doesn't rank with Faulkner or Melville but beats the 
Hemingway-Fitzgerald bunch by a longshot." 
<p>
It was surprising that Norman Mailer responded to the survey by specifying 
that only one of his responses could be quoted--the response to this 
comparative question. He claimed that C&eacute;line is "significantly less 
valuable than Henry Miller." The remark is consistent with Mailer's having 
championed Henry Miller in 
<I>The Prisoner of Sex,</I>
 after Miller had 
been famously attacked by feminist essayist Kate Millett in her 
<I>Sexual Politics.</I>
 C&eacute;line is an occasion for Mailer to continue 
championing Miller.

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>Titles</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
C&eacute;line's English-language titles attracted attention. Gary Indiana, 
as noted above, saw C&eacute;line's paperbacks at the newsstand when he 
was thirteen or fourteen years old, and "liked the titles." Tom Wolfe 
thinks that 
<I>Death on the Installment Plan</I>
 is the "greatest book 
title ever devised--better in English than it is in French." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">
16</A>
</SUP>
Greil Marcus, music critic and historian of punk rock, confessed to never 
having read C&eacute;line--"I haven't gotten around to it (also haven't 
read Woolf, Forster, etc); afraid I might like it too much (not 
kidding)"--yet he responded to several of the questions on the basis of 
his received ideas about C&eacute;line. Marcus has clearly absorbed 
C&eacute;line, in English, at the level of the titles: in 
<I>Dead Elvis,</I>
 published the year of the survey, he entitled a chapter "Ten 
Years After: Death on the Installment Plan." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
There is 
already a strong trickle-down effect of C&eacute;liniana in the culture, 
available to a knowledgeable critic like Marcus. C&eacute;line's English 
titles are recyclable as slogans; the writer himself is known, even by 
someone who hasn't read him, as forbidden and dangerous. 
<B></B>
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>Voice and Freedom</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
C&eacute;line's effect on a writer's own practice was often connected by 
the respondents to the category of voice, although what "voice" means 
varied widely: 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">
18</A>
</SUP>
Jay McInerny, for example, spoke of "a 
freeing up of the inner voice, a license to say whatever you feel," while 
for Andrei Codrescu, C&eacute;line's writing is characterized by "the 
closeness of the speaking mouth: you can taste the spittle." Clark Blaise 
in a follow-up interview referred to C&eacute;line as promoting a 
"singularity of voice": "voice" in this case is akin to originality, or 
"signature," and for Blaise this is the key element in C&eacute;line. Like 
Samuel Beckett, Blaise contends, C&eacute;line is "entirely a 'voice 
writer.'" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">
19</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Several writers acknowledged the effect of C&eacute;line as one of 
"freedom." Again, what liberation meant varied. For the Rumanian-born 
Codrescu, C&eacute;line represented a freedom from institutions: "He has 
given me license to practice medicine regardless of what authorities are 
watching." For Maxine Hong Kingston, he endorsed a freer speech, an end to 
secrets: "Perhaps I am assured by C&eacute;line that it's all right to say 
anything I want." In Jim Harrison's response, this freedom is physical and 
spiritual, linked to speed and range, power and godliness: "a strong early 
influence along with Faulkner etc., in terms of digression, freedom, how 
to accelerate fiction as if you were a god." Even 2 of the anonymous 
respondents, who were otherwise hostile to C&eacute;line, used the word 
"freedom," though grudgingly: "he freed [my writing] up--slightly"; 
"perhaps a certain freedom." In a 1984 interview in the 
<I>Quinzaine Litt&eacute;raire,</I>
 Philip Roth combined these notions of voice and 
freedom in a provocative tribute to C&eacute;line, calling him "my 
Proust": "C&eacute;line," Roth concluded, "is a great liberator; I feel 
called by his voice." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">
20</A>
</SUP>
It is difficult to tell from his 
phrasing, translated here from the French, to what purpose Roth feels 
called. C&eacute;line's "call," I suspect, is nothing other than the call 
to read C&eacute;line and to write. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>The Pamphlets</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
C&eacute;line's political affinities, his targets, and the passionate 
debates over what purpose his hate language served in its original context 
wither, or are suspended by many passionate American readers, in the 
interests of his writerly, emancipating effects. This may be both because 
he is not an American writer--and is therefore exempt from more local 
political passions--and because the full-blown expression of his racism 
takes place only in the pamphlets, which (with the exception of 
<I>Mea Culpa</I>
 [1936], an anticommunist polemic) are not available in English 
translation and so tend not to cloud his American reception. 
<p>
Nevertheless, many more people (13, the number of 
<I>Voyage</I>
 readers) 
claim to have read one or more of the pamphlets (
<I>Mea Culpa,</I>
<I>Bagatelles pour un massacre</I>
 [1937], 
<I>L'&Eacute;cole des cadavres</I>
 [1938], and 
<I>Les Beaux Draps</I>
 [1941]) than have read the 
playful postwar send-up of the world of journalists and editors, 
<I>Entretiens avec le Professeur Y</I>
 , which was translated and 
published as 
<I>Conversations with Professor</I>
<B></B>
<I>Y</I>
 in the United States in a 1986 bilingual edition. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">

</SUP>
Saul 
Bellow read 
<I>Les Beaux Draps</I>
 in Paris in 1948, and responded to the 
survey with the following pun: "I still remember the hackles those fine 
sheets raised" ("fine sheets" being the transposition of the reference to 
bedsheets in 
<I>"beaux draps,"</I>
 by which C&eacute;line is referring to 
the "fine fix" that the French have gotten themselves into during the 
Occupation). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Overwhelmingly, the pamphlet readers have closer connections to France and 
to the French language than do the writers who have read only the novels. 
Saul Bellow was born in Montreal and has lived in France. Clark Blaise is 
of Quebecois origins. Raymond Federman, an American writer born in France 
in 1928, was the only survey respondent to have read every C&eacute;line 
text, French and English. Richard Howard is the foremost American 
translator of French literature. The writer and former journalist Sanche 
de Gramont came to the United States from France as an adult and changed 
his name to Ted Morgan. The poets Michael Palmer and Keith Waldrop also 
translate from the French and have close intellectual ties to France. Gary 
Indiana read the pamphlets while living in France. 
<p>
Age is significant: of the 13 pamphlet readers, 9 were born between 1911 
and 1932, and only 3 were born after 1940--the youngest, Gary Indiana, in 
1950. While he was living in France in 1980, Indiana read copies of 
<I>Bagatelles pour un massacre,</I>
<I>L'&Eacute;cole des cadavres,</I>
and 
<I>Les Beaux Draps</I>
 borrowed from Jean-Jacques Schuhl, an 
experimental French novelist with an affinity for the Beats. No respondent 
under forty-two years of age had read the pamphlets. This is a provocative 
result, for it implies that the memory of C&eacute;line's anti-Semitic 
writing is fading among his readers today. One might argue about whether 
that is good or bad, from both an ethical and an aesthetic point of view. 
<p>
The responses I want to juxtapose with the surprising number of readers of 
the pamphlets--20 percent of those who responded to the survey--are to the 
question "Are you aware of the controversy over C&eacute;line's political 
views?" and to the follow-up question "What effect has that awareness had 
on your appreciation of his work?" Forty-two writers responded that they 
were aware of the controversy, while only 1 writer wasn't. What interests 
me here is the way American writers deal with a re who is morally 
compromised, how they factor politics and formal considerations in reading 
C&eacute;line. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>Politics versus Form</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
Thirteen people said that C&eacute;line's political views had no effect on 
their reading; they answered with such startling one-liners as "none," 
"little or none," "little," "almost none," "not much," and "absolutely no 
effect." Of these 13 readers, 1 had read all four pamphlets, while another 
had read only 
<I>Bagatelles pour un massacre.</I>
 The "none at all" group 
included Adrian Piper, a professor of philosophy and performance artist 
who has taken strong political positions against American racism in her 
own art, most recently in an installation on the Rodney King incident. 
<B></B>
<p>
At the other end of the spectrum were the people who refused to read 
C&eacute;line. For example, Paul Bowles declared, "I have avoided him for 
5 decades," while Richard Selzer said, "I prefer not to read bigots and 
fascists. Life is too short. Art is too long." The anonymous respondents 
had harsher things to say, for example, "don't you dare associate me with 
C&eacute;line." Or, in response to the question "Are you aware of the 
controversy over C&eacute;line's political views?" one respondent asked in 
turn if the evil of Nazism could be construed as controversial, i.e., 
debatable. Jim Harrison offered up his own split between politics and 
aesthetics in the form of self-criticism: "Writers tend to be politically 
naive, self included. Have to stick to the work itself." 
<p>
Another group of respondents considered politics and form as inseparable 
issues (this is one of the few groupings where none of the respondents 
asked for anonymity). Charles Bernstein described the effects of 
C&eacute;line's politics as "part of the complexity of his work," whereas 
for Clark Blaise, "it provokes a sharper scrutiny of the good work and 
helps explain the bad." With regard to the effect of his awareness of the 
C&eacute;line controversy, Michael Palmer commented that "an awareness 
comes through the work, not apart from it." For Gary Indiana, 
"C&eacute;line's vision is so deranging and raucous that his political 
views--which are impossible to take seriously--become a source of humor." 
Andrei Codrescu expressed it more ratively: "the writing is 
generative: the views are to the writing what shit is to flowers, 
unfortunately." C&eacute;line, for Bob Perelman, is "an intensely 
interesting problem." Maxine Hong Kingston, however, reported a negative 
effect. She "liked the energy, the language . . . the idea that one must 
do anything--including go to jail--rather than join the army"; she saw 
C&eacute;line as a "wild hare, like Ezra Pound in American literature" but 
stopped reading C&eacute;line after hearing about his "weird views." Lydia 
Davis responded to this question with questions of her own: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
To raise the very difficult question of morality and literature--i.e., how 
immoral can a piece of writing be and still be given highest honors and 
esteem--more broadly, how much, if anything, can or should be sacrificed 
for the sake of a piece of art. It forces me to judge author as man 
separately from work as work, despise a moral failing while admiring a 
consummate work of art. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Again, in the 1984 
<I>Quinzaine Litt&eacute;raire</I>
 interview, Philip 
Roth, perhaps the best-known American Jewish writer in France, gives this 
dichotomy between ideology and literature a poetic form, describing an art 
that transcends his own subject position. "To read him," Roth says about 
C&eacute;line, "I have to suspend my Jewish conscience, but I do it, 
because anti-Semitism is not at the heart of his books, even 
<I>D'un chateau l'autre.</I>
" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Historically C&eacute;line has always been positioned differently in the 
United States than in France. Thus Roth's bracketing of C&eacute;line's 
anti-Semitism can be understood as part of an American tradition and as 
the long-range consequence of an editorial decision made by an American 
publisher during the 1930s. In 1938, the year 
<I>Bagatelles</I>
 was 
selling briskly in France, C&eacute;line proposed the anti-Semitic 
pamphlet to Little, Brown. His American editor, Herbert Jenkins, rejected 
it definitively: 
<B></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
As you indicated in your letter, this is a four-hundred page attack on the 
Jews written with your usual vigor and violence. It does not appear to 
contain any narrative or personal experiences except in the last forty 
pages. We feel that you have made statements which are unsupported by 
evidence and that its publication here will seriously damage your 
reputation as an outstanding author. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
It was a rejection that would have long-term consequences for 
C&eacute;line's American reputation. It looks, in retrospect, as if the 
rejection of 
<I>Bagatelles</I>
 in 1938--and the fact that all of the 
anti-Semitic material of the 1930s and 1940s would remain untranslated and 
therefore unavailable to American readers--helped create a situation in 
which C&eacute;line could maintain his identity for American readers of 
the late 1940s and beyond solely as the author of 
<I>Journey to the End of the Night</I>
 and 
<I>Death on the Installment Plan.</I>
 When Kenneth 
Rexroth, in a 1959 essay, "forgives" C&eacute;line on the very point that 
he can't forgive Eliot and Pound, he does so by purposefully limiting the 
C&eacute;line corpus to the novels: "We can, if we confine ourselves to 
the two great novels, forgive C&eacute;line for being an anti-Semite, but 
when, as the Communists used to say, 'Art is a weapon,' then we cannot 
forgive. We cannot forgive the direct, depraved political tendentiousness 
of T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, or [Eug&egrave;ne] Guillevic." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">

</SUP>
Whether or not, in their French context, the pamphlets functioned as 
"weapons" is not an issue Rexroth explores. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>Conclusion: The C&eacute;line Effect</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
The most important finding to emerge from the survey is that while 
C&eacute;line's novels may sell under 5,000 copies a year in the United 
States, he apparently endures as a writer for writers in a specific 
tradition: C&eacute;line as anarchist, liberator, anti-James/anti-Eliot 
re in twentieth-century American letters, pitted against a whole 
tradition of polite, subtle psychological fiction and poetry. This 
dominant C&eacute;line effect was what I wished to explore. 
<p>
Peter Glassgold, who succeeded James Laughlin as editor-in-chief of New 
Directions, wrote in response to the survey that C&eacute;line "had an 
interesting impact in the '60s, helping to dynamite the Jamesian dominance 
of what a real novel ought to be. But I'm afraid this has degenerated and 
been watered down by creative writing programs." I asked Clark Blaise to 
tell me, therefore, as an educator of writers at the University of Iowa 
Writers' Workshop and director of its International Writing Program, what 
he thought "being a Jamesian" meant. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Rigorous attention to unity of point of view, tone, elevation of 
psychological realism, stifling expression; everything disguised--out of 
that comes Eliot, the aged eagle spreading his wings at age twenty. In the 
U. S., the clich&eacute;s of writing are "politics are ruinous for good 
writing/dreams and allegories are cheap devices; write what you know; 
show, don't tell." C&eacute;line, who breaks all the rules, "expands the 
perimeter of the permissible." 
<I>The New Yorker,</I>
 with its tailored 
tone, would detest C&eacute;line. . . . I learned through C&eacute;line 
that an unevenness of tone is not a flaw; spleen can be 
bracing. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">

</SUP>
<B></B>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Blaise uses C&eacute;line in the classroom to dismantle received ideas 
about American writing. He is highly critical of the idea that you must 
write from your own experience; he thinks it culturally impoverishes young 
American writers, making them anti-intellectual. It is paradoxical to use 
C&eacute;line against the write-what-you-know rule, given that 
C&eacute;line himself was an autobiographical writer, but for American 
students both the experiences described by C&eacute;line and his mode of 
description are radically unfamiliar. C&eacute;line's work provides 
alternative forms and demonstrates that a writer can rave and lose 
control, to "tell" as well as to "show." 
<p>
The C&eacute;line effect is also marked for Blaise by a class difference. 
As a writer of the lower crust, again the opposite of James and Eliot, 
C&eacute;line is an emblematic re for writers of French-Canadian 
descent (including Blaise and Kerouac before him), whose French identity 
is tied to the marginalized working classes rather than a more 
aristocratic sense of literariness connoted by "Frenchness" in the United 
States. Paradoxically, the French writer gives Americans license to reject 
the worship of Europe that is part of our cultural baggage: "I'm not a 
francophile in terms of French," Blaise explained. "C&eacute;line tells 
you that the French are a low, vermin-encrusted culture; highfalutin 
phrases come down to shit." According to Blaise, C&eacute;line's portraits 
of the disenfranchised have situated his writing in a register that is 
subliterary, "stinking of the world and of everything impolite, authentic, 
and dangerous"--what Blaise referred to as an "aim of artlessness" in 
C&eacute;linian poetics.

<p>
The picture that finally emerges of the American C&eacute;line--in terms 
of published, acknowledged influences (as opposed to my survey)--is West 
Coast, not East Coast; Beat and City Lights, not 
<I>The New Yorker;</I>
New Directions, not New Critical. New Directions is certainly an East 
Coast institution, so the East/West American split is not literally true. 
But it is evocative: C&eacute;line as westerner--roving, the bad boy. He 
is a scandalous re who can be celebrated by people who hate the 
system.

<A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">

<p>
Bob Perelman, a Language poet who spent many years in the San Francisco 
area, acknowledges the flavor of this American C&eacute;line when he says, 
as noted above, that he did not come to C&eacute;line through the usual 
"leftist-nihilist-anarchist enthusiasm." That this enthusiasm should be 
occasioned by a foreign writer whose deeply felt ideas are unacceptable in 
this culture is perhaps no accident, and it remains a subject for further 
analysis. How would American writers describe the effect of Pound's or 
Eliot's anti-Semitism on the appreciation of these poets? How would French 
writers come to terms with C&eacute;line's ideology in response to a 
similar survey? 
<p>
There is something specific in our culture that gives American writers the 
freedom to love C&eacute;line, or--to put it another way--that might 
account for the fact that the United States was the 
<I>only</I>

he was threatened with extradition from Denmark to France.

Certainly the American First Amendment tradition is consistent with a 
libertarian defense of C&eacute;line, regardless of his views. The First 
Amendment is tacitly present in several of the responses to the question 
about the effect C&eacute;line's politics on an appreciation of his 
writing ("none at all," "absolutely none"). 
<B></B>
<p>
Along with our First Amendment culture, there is a specific New Critical 
tradition of close reading, which separates politics from aesthetic 
appreciation. The Beats were not New Critics--anything but--yet the 
impulse toward art that aims to be formally transcendent, canonical 
because disinterested, runs deep. James Laughlin explained this position 
in his introduction to the 1946 New Directions annual. Although he is 
defending Paul Eluard and Pound, his explanation could just as easily 
apply to his defense of C&eacute;line, that same year, when he signed the 
petition in his favor: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
I have been severely criticized for publishing Eluard because he is said 
to be a Stalinist. He is a killer, they tell me; he killed Germans with 
his poems. Very well: I have two answers to that. Much as I am opposed to 
the whole business of war and legal killing I would probably have done, or 
tried to do, exactly what Eluard did under similar circumstances. And 
secondly, I don't care whether he is a Stalinist or what he is; the man 
can write. He is a poet and no mistake. That's enough for me. I am one who 
still thinks Ezra Pound's poetry is good--very good--not withstanding his 
political folly. These people who changed their minds about the merits of 
Pound's poetry the day he was indicted for treason make me sick and angry. 
A poem is a thing in itself. You judge it by itself, for itself and of 
itself--not by the politics of the man who wrote it. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">
30</A>
</SUP>
The gist 
of this defense is pacifist and libertarian, but appeals most of all to 
the integrity of the art object and the talent of the artist: "the man can 
write." In 1942, Henry Miller articulated the same position, in his case 
specifically in reference to C&eacute;line: "I don't care whether he is a 
Fascist or a Democrat or a shit-house cleaner. 
<I>He can write.</I>
" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">
31</A>
</SUP>
This can-do/separatist defense of the 
politically compromised writer informs the 1946 petition and remains a 
familiar stance in all subsequent American discussions of C&eacute;line. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The other side of the coin is the refusal to read C&eacute;line. This 
rejectionist position is the same one often taken with respect to Martin 
Heidegger or Paul de Man. Political flaws or ideologically unacceptable 
positions in the text or in the author's life become a kind of obscenity, 
and the work is censured. This, too, is distinctly American. 
<p>
A third position that comes out of the survey is an integrationist one. 
This position would read C&eacute;line in many layers, many contexts, and 
recontextualizations, measuring the energy of the work in its passage 
through time and space. Often the most nuanced and conflicted positions 
boil down to this attempt to make the work make sense on both an 
ideological and poetic level, without reducing it to either one. Michael 
Palmer, who objected to the either/or quality of my questions about 
C&eacute;line's politics versus his writing, explained in a follow-up 
postcard: "It really comes down to the reasons, at a fairly early stage, 
for my 'refusal' of the work. Certainly the fascism, but something else as 
well, perhaps a reductive bitterness which permeated it and (for me) 'automatized' the process of composition." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">
32</A>
</SUP>
For poet Charles 
Bernstein, who, unlike Palmer, is "very excited by the style, the urgency, 
the '. . .' as poetic fragmentation, stream of tirade," C&eacute;line's 
politics "deepens an appreciation of the dystopian and repulsive character 
of this work." 
<B></B>
<p>
As a counter to the well-made novel or poem, as a re of resistance and 
liberation from literary authority as historically constituted by the New 
Criticism, even as the occasion for moral conflict, C&eacute;line still 
signifies a vital critical function within the American institutions of 
literature.

The University of Iowa Writers' Workshop was founded in Iowa City by poet 
Paul Engle in 1936, a time when the study of English in graduate schools 
was strictly scholarly, rather than creative, and when a Depression-era 
cultural agrarianism was spawning arts activities in small towns and rural 
areas. The writers' workshop model established at Iowa proliferated to the 
point where by 1986 there were 150 graduate writing programs in the United 
States. Most major university English departments now offer creative 
writing at the undergraduate level. The influence of the Iowa Workshop on 
the writing and marketing of American fiction and poetry cannot be 
overestimated, given the prominence of the writers who have taught there 
and the highly developed network between workshop graduates and such 
periodicals as 
<I>The Atlantic,</I>
<I>The Paris Review,</I>
 and 
<I>Antaeus,</I>
 which have launched the careers of many workshop writers.

<p>
The vagueness of nineteenth-century criteria for pornography is
infamous. The British jurist Alexander Cockburn, for example, wrote that
pornography "deprave[s] and corrupt[s] those whose minds
are open to immoral influences," and although his nebulous statement
gave rise to some debate about the dangers of such imprecise
definition, no sources suggest that contemporaries had any doubt about
what constituted pornography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Though it is true that
obscenity laws in England, France, and Germany were invoked to
prosecute pamphlets about contraception, cheap sexually explicit
texts, as well as politically suspect writing, prosecution was
typically conducted with genuine confidence in the solidity of the
pornography concept.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It was only in the aftermath of World
War I that charges against "pornographic" work became increasingly
inconsistent, incoherent, and enacted for the most part with great
reluctance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 In a dramatic epistemological and rhetorical
shift, critics began to use the term "pornography" to designate less
an identifiable category of texts and images, more the attenuation or
dissolution of semantic categories that had once been clearly
demarcated. The appellation "pornographic" no longer served to define
so-called immoral material, but to re the social as a body whose
desire exceeded conventional boundaries between morality and
immorality. This important transformation in the status of pornography
usually goes unremarked, and yet the catechrestic use of "pornography"
to which it gave rise informs nearly all current accounts of what
pornography represents. <b></b> 

<p>
Indeed, commentators of different ideological persuasions transform
pornography's unclear boundaries into the theoretical grounds on which
to oppose censorship. Because pornography cannot be clearly defined,
many American liberals insist that censors might wittingly or
unwittingly target worthy ideas that they believe are
pornographic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 In a more affirmative evaluation of
pornography, anti-censorship feminists argue that the term designates
material that refuses to define human desire in fixed terms, and will
be the target of censors committed to destroying social forces
(including women's, lesbian, and gay liberation) that challenge the
dominance of normative heterosexuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In contrast, those
who are most committed to pornography's abolition reject the assertion
that pornography is an elastic category of meaning. Feminists opposed
to pornography, most notably represented by legal scholar Catharine
MacKinnon, argue that pornography is so central to the maintenance of
men's power that arguments about its elasticity are merely ruses the
justice system employs to keep pornography legal. MacKinnon defines
pornography as a form of gender exploitation, and gender exploitation
as a form of pornography. The persuasive power of her analysis,
however, lies in the rhythmic repetition of this tautology rather than
in any precise definition of the pornographic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 

<p>
Like these feminists, fundamentalist Christians (from a different
vantage point) extend the notion of pornography to include an array of
materials so vast and divergent that it renders their definition
equally imprecise. Because pornography means everything, it means
nothing in particular, which may account for the rather dramatic
slippage that pairs "pornography" with images of lynching, sexuality,
or even environmental pollution. Such images share only one feature:
they are "pornographic," meaning, tautologically, that they are racist
or sexist, and ratively, that they contaminate the air we breathe.

<p>
Debates about whether or not to censor pornography have thus become
occasions to assert, in various ways, the elasticity of its meaning.
But to the extent that elasticity defines its socio-cultural power,
pornography is curiously emptied of any concrete meaning: its
elasticity cannot therefore be particular to anything substantive
about pornography itself. If we focus less on the explicit social
agendas of different debates and address the ideological structure
that makes those debates possible, we might speculate about how this
construction of pornography as a conceptually indeterminate category
developed.

<p>
Some scholars have suggested that pornography violates the integrity
of the human body by stripping it of the abstract rights invested in
it since the eighteenth century. In this view, the concept of the
pornographic refers above all to instances in images or texts when a
body is treated as if it were merely a body, a "thing" to be used.
Frances Ferguson defines the Marquis de Sade's materialist reduction
of the body to its use-value, rather than its rights, as the origin of
modern pornography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This analysis provides a unified base
for the very different arguments made by 
censorship and anti-censorship advocates alike: that pornography
represents the degradation of women's and men's bodies
(anti-pornography feminists); that it denies human spirituality by
denying the integrity of bodies (fundamentalists); that it must
 <b></b> be defended in case we mistake real "art" for unworthy
"pornography" (liberals); that it shatters a fixed concept of the
body's desires (anti-censorship feminists). These arguments depend for
their coherence on the idea that pornography is an assault on human
integrity and rational subjectivity for better or (usually) for worse.

<p>
Ferguson's argument, however useful, retrospectively endows Sade's
work with meanings that were not invented until the early twentieth
century. These meanings, I shall argue, first emerge in the wake of
the Great War, when social commentators and analysts began to
postulate a significant link between the wartime proliferation of
pornography and the unprecedented violence of modern combat. Only then
did pornography and violence became continuous descriptions of
assaults on the integrity of the human body, establishing a sense of
continuity that remains essential to the idea that pornography is a
mobile category of meaning with no fixed referents. It is not a
coincidence, in other words, that during the years since 1920
<I>non-violent</I> heterosexual "pornography" has gradually been
exempted from obscenity prosecution in the United States and Western
Europe. Nor is it surprising that anti-pornography feminist activists
believe that pornography <I>is</I><B> </B>violence against
women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Both are reflexes of the massive redefinition of
pornography sparked by the Great War. 

<p>
In the mid- to late nineteenth century, cultural elites defined
pornography as material that stimulated or provoked sexual sensations
and acts that were antisocial, even dangerous, especially in the
morally weak or unformed (i.e. children, women, working-class men).
Pornography, by stimulating nerves already overwrought, compromised
the rational will, blurring the boundaries between fantasy and
reality, and reduced human passion to sexual instincts; in so doing it
transformed manly men into effetes enslaved by their senses,
threatening the reproductive heterosexuality that subtended class and
gender hierarchies. By the end of the Great War, however, this kind of
rhetoric had shifted. Pornography's putative degradation of the human
body no longer signified undisciplined sexual pleasure, but
represented discipline as a form of pleasure. My focus is on how this
shift occurred, its repercussions, and, most importantly, how it
transformed the concept of rational subjectivity that depends on a
clear distinction between compulsion and will, pleasure and
discipline, for its very stability. By transforming male bodies into
"pornographic" spectacles, the war unravelled conventional boundaries
between the moral and immoral, a process that also dissolved gender
distinctions that those boundaries subtended and thereby 
precipitated a reinscription of masculinity and femininity in new
terms. 

<p>
While it is true that eroticized violence was a predominant theme in
underground pornography in England and North America during the
nineteenth century, 
contemporaries generally viewed it as a manifestation of its authors'
and readers' weakness of moral will; its violence was one among many
examples of the human susceptibility to sin which was evident in all
pornographic material.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 After the Great War, however, there
is a new continuity between the thematics of war and pornography, in
which sexualized violence becomes the primary example of human moral
failure. Already before the war, in 1905, Sigmund Freud had suggested
that "the 
 <b></b> history of human civilization shows beyond any doubt that there
is an intimate 
connection between cruelty and the sexual instinct."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 But
it was during the interwar years that most critics and medical men
insisted on the primacy of "sexual emotion," repeatedly stressing "the
narrow connection between <I>jouissance</I> [pleasure] and 
suffering."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Although this discourse was partly a
consequence of the war--one thinks of Freud's 1920 <I>Beyond
the Pleasure Principle</I>--it also constituted the terms
within which the war was narrativized. For a wide range of
commentators, war became an extension of sexuality and sexuality an
extension of the violence intrinsic in warfare, a connection often
established by equating war with sadomasochistic sexuality. In 1933,
for example, Dr. Paul Englisch urged a direct link between the Great
War and flagellation pornography: "Whereas before the war of 1914
German pornographers focused on normal sexual relations, in its
aftermath pornography about sexual perversion flourished. Long years
in the trenches stirred men's sadistic instincts and their taste for
horror."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 

<p>
Englisch's remarks need to be set within the context of more
generalized myths about modern war, in which violence and the
spiritual cleansing of the male body are oddly continuous: violence,
paradoxically, purges the suffering intrinsic in violence. As Paul
Gautier argued in 1919, war is a "natural" form of destruction aimed
at social regeneration and "the happiness of all." It is a process
that repairs "seams in the social fabric" by awakening "moral force
and courage": war, which is also a sin, is a form of "punishment,
expiation, and suffering," but a "purifying suffering <I>[douleur
purificatrice]"</I> and hence a sin that also cleanses the social body
of sin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Gautier was only reiterating a long romantic
tradition in this construction of patriotism as willful
self-sacrifice, a tradition repeatedly invoked by journalists and
novelists throughout the war's duration. Governments, as historians
have demonstrated, likewise propagated the image of the brave soldier
whose soul goes to heaven, his spiritual wounds healed by the
rative tears of the nation. War-induced suffering purges the body
of sin, and that suffering itself is transcended through national
mourning.

<p>
But the Great War provoked a reassessment of this myth. In 1917, the
critic Edmond Haraucourt wrote a report, commissioned by the
government, about pornography laws and the effects of "demoralizing"
literature and images in a far more critical vein. He argued that the
Great War had transformed the willful and noble sacrifice of men's
bodies into the love of death. In this account, patriotism no longer
served to heal wounds, but became a pretext for inflicting more
wounds, more eviscerations: <I>"Vers l'amour"</I> now means <I>"pour
la mort."</I> He goes on: "At the end of this long alert which
unleashed violent instincts, we can expect to find those instincts
alive and well. . . . We will continue to kill a great deal after the
war." For Haraucourt, pornography instantiates this never-ending cycle
of death and destruction evacuated of transcendent meaning, and
deprives this myth--whereby the soldier's suffering cleanses
the national body of sins--of narrative closure. Before the
war, "[pornographers] troubled morality; during the war, they did not
respect our mourning, and after the war, they constitute a threat to
the motherland." Although he never articulates <b></b> a 
clear relationship between the war and pornography, he believes that
pornography has become one of the primary vehicles through which the
"contagion" of war, the "attraction to death," will be disseminated.
Depicting human life as a struggle between love and death, Haraucourt
argues that the war has signalled the triumph of death and transformed
sexual desire into longing "for death." Pornography both represents
and produces a national psyche in which the supreme sacrifice is no
longer continuous with the body's cleansing but with its degradation,
and acts of will have become inseparable from psychic
compulsion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 

<p>
Moreover, writers again and again red women as emblems of the
war's sexual sadism. In 1921 Marcello Fabri represented the war as a
seductive female vampire who drains male bodies of their virility, and
he noted a correlation between the "thirst for blood," sexual
perversion, and pornography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 According to Fabri,
patriotic self-sacrifice is no longer a dignified, because freely
chosen, gesture, but a pleasurable, irresistible, virility-sapping
perversion. Charles-Noel Renard also allegorizes the war as a pack of
vampire lesbians whom men find irresistible.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 

<p>
There are numerous interwar novels and commentaries in which women are
surrogates for war, and the sadistic and vampiristic qualities
ascribed to women in them draw upon conventional tropes. But many
critics describe soldiers--and men's role in warfare more
generally--in less conventional terms. They no longer equate
self-sacrifice with spiritual cleansing, but with spiritual
degradation; the body has become enslaved by its own instincts, or,
more specifically, by a compulsive death-drive. Men have learned to
obey their instincts unencumbered by the dictates of moral
will.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The war's degradation of men's dignity is red
in the putatively 
emasculating and sexually pathological pleasure of humiliating and
being humiliated, of exposing and being exposed. The war, in this
view, had turned into a pretext for the satisfaction of other
pleasures.

<p>
In a 1921 work graced with a preface by the famous Swiss sexologist
Auguste Forel, Andr&eacute; Lorulot compared the Great War's
"barbarism" to the sadistic pleasures that Spanish inquisitors had
taken in performing their task. He conjured up 
predictable anti-clerical images of debauched, perverted priests, but
in a later work he made his real point more explicit. In a book about
German barbarism that is essentially a litany of anecdotes about
flagellation and sexual perversions, he considers the question of how
punishment could produce sexual feelings so powerful that men and
women "passionately sought them out." Lorulot finally associates
sadomasochism with pathological politics, and specifically with
Hitler's rise to power.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Jean de Mezerette, in a similar
and by then predictable theme, will re Hitler and his entourage as
effeminate, homosexual, sadomasochistic, and Jewish (although he
deleted all references to Jews in the 1945 edition).
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<p>
The magazine editor Georges Anquetil's 1925 <I>Satan Conduit le
bal</I> (Satan Leads the Dance) similarly equates the war with
sadomasochistic sexuality. Trench journalists had already described
the spectacle of dismembered corpses in macabre detail, but Anquetil
implicitly eroticizes such images by juxtaposing flagellation scenes
in <b></b> brothels with anecdotes of war atrocities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The
war is turned into a transnational brothel, another eroticized
<I>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</I> in which the body's private pleasure and
pain become public affairs. In short, he represents "depraved
morality" as an eroticized quest for death whose most privileged
embodiment is sadomasochistic 
spectacle: the body bound, unclothed, mutilated,
humiliated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In the anti-German articles he penned in
1917, Paul Voivenel had argued that sadomasochism directed the German
war effort on the grounds that German soldiers took masochistic 
pleasure in "waxing the boots of the State."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

Sadomasochism implies the submission of the individual to the State
and the collapse of private and public, symbolized again, in Lorulot's
and Anquetil's many anecdotes, by the constrained, even wounded body,
flushed with pleasure in spite of itself. The novelist Louis Dumur's
antihero describes an assassination that makes his companions' faces
light up with a "pure and evident pleasure," and confesses that the
sadistic rape and murder that constitute the center of the novel
"disgusted and excited me at the same time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 

<p>
Critics increasingly associated corporeal degradation with the war's
unprecedented destruction of bodies, and they conceived narratives
about German war atrocities as pedagogical tools meant to instruct
civilians about the horrors of war. But these narratives worked for
and against their own ideological (nationalist) 
purposes. In their frequent efforts to portray German militarism as
the pathological (because sadomasochistic) desire for discipline, they
implicitly question the motives of all military discipline. The
Germans' sadomasochism implies that patriotic self-sacrifice might
have other, more suspect motives. The war, in such accounts, appears
to transform <I>all</I> soldiers into sexual perverts, permanently
contaminating postwar culture as well. Although the "thirst for blood"
has existed in all places and all times, wrote Marcello Fabri, the
soldier of this war has demonstrated an unparalleled desire to
<I>"jouir-avant-la-mort."</I> The desire has proved contagious: "no
longer 
content to suck at wounds like a vampire [the people] demand more
victims to 
pollute, and this ignominious spectacle is still not enough to satisfy
their senses."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Now, Renard writes, in this "feminine"
Republic, "all begins and ends in sexual 
sensation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Writers who believe that the war was
motivated by perversion rather than patriotism indict the French
government for legitimating the war's unparalleled, frenzied sadism.
They no longer criticize warfare itself, but the effects of this war,
especially its sexual contamination of postwar French
culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>


<p>
These accounts call into question the distinction between "normal"
sexual instinct and perversion, insofar as they leave it unclear
whether sadomasochistic sexuality (and hence a propensity to torture
and rape) is a natural inclination of human beings freed from social
stigmas, or the perverted product of industrialized warfare. For
Lorulot and Anquetil, the war is merely a vehicle for the acting out
of sadomasochistic pleasure, even as they characterize that pleasure
as the pathological product of war. In 1918, Voivenel and another
doctor, Louis Huot, sought to explain soldiers' psychology as the ebb
and flow of sexual instinct. At the beginning of the war, when young
European men marched blindly and bravely off to the front in the
 <b></b> name of patriotism, "the hypnotism of destruction [was]
comparable to a rooster 
hypnotized by sexual instinct."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Yet they also claimed
that the war was responsible for transforming men into machines of
destruction. Haraucourt similarly argued that the war both "unleashed
violent instincts" <I>and</I> produced them.

<p>
In perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this paradox, debates
among medical men about the effects of war on soldiers suggested that
barbaric acts manifested an "instinct of preservation" in face of
fear. They transformed barbarism into the body's natural quest for
survival. The shock of so much violence, the effect of being "a
plaything" of overwhelming forces, produced irrational, unmanly
behavior that nevertheless had a rational and reassuring explanation.
At the same time, doctors 
presumed that barbarism--here the male body's instinctive
defense against unnatural sensations and feelings of
powerlessness--was also psychopathological.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

Hence the best soldiers (with some exceptions) turned out to be
alcoholics and perverts because their "impulsiveness," "taste for
adventure," and "morbid courage"--their so-called social
defects--transformed them into heroic soldiers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

Because psychopathology is a symptom of war, Dr. Ren&eacute;
Charpentier argued, the best soldiers are often psychopaths. He
recommended that "in times of war, we not systematically exclude from
the army certain men we would reject in peacetime . . . [their]
psychopathologies are, at least temporarily, compatible with national
defense."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>


<p>
If psychopathology was compatible with national defense, then
nationalism--
soldiers' willingness to die for their country--no longer
always required self-
discipline. The soldiers' self-sacrifice was not necessarily an act of
supreme self-restraint. This construction of the soldiers' patriotism
compromised the distinction between a man's free will and his
degrading concession to instinctual pleasures. Because writers more
generally redefined military discipline itself as a form of perverse
(indeed, psychopathological) pleasure, they so completely conflated
patriotic self-sacrifice and sadomasochistic desire that they
portrayed nationalist impulses as sadomasochistic ones, and rendered
the sacred national body indistinct from a 
 profane, contaminated one.

<p>
And yet these same writers sought through these sorts of analyses to
restore national integrity. Such analyses had recent precedents: in
1903, for example, in defense of Emile Zola, Ernest Charles noted that
readers' saturation with repulsive texts would regenerate
literature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Zola himself believed that in order to
cleanse the social body, a writer was obliged to expose and describe
the causes of its impurity. Writers used this argument as the
paradoxical foundation of postwar regeneration. Louis Dumur's defense
against censorship was that his book about the war "told the truth."
His 
editor claimed he had received hundreds of letters protesting the
sadistic rape scene of an aristocratic French woman by German
generals; they accused him of being "a pornographer." In his defense,
Dumur claimed that the Germans counted on the silence of thousands of
French women who refused to speak out from a sense of shame and
modesty <I>[par pudeur]</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Dumur did not denounce war
but the German people--the book is Dumur's rewriting of the
stories told to him by a German 
 <b></b> captain at a POW camp. His aim was not to depict the horrors of
war or to call the concept of women's <I>pudeur</I> into question, but
to demonstrate that the atrocities 
perpetrated by the Germans were real. He argued that his admittedly
fictional account of the war would restore the French to their senses;
the <I>pudeur</I> of ashamed women, like the <I>pudeur</I><B> </B>of a
nation raped and pillaged, had to be violated in order to be restored.

<p>
Similarly, Georges Anquetil, whose book is a seven hundred page
compendium of the most ghastly war atrocities juxtaposed with their
civilian analogues, asked "Am I the only one to denounce the
perversion all around us?" He goes on to "cite and resume all the
unimaginable series of savageries, of sadism, of cruelty, and of
pederasty . . . during the war," in order to make them imaginable and
hence unimaginable in the future. 

<p>
Haraucourt also argued that literature that simply repressed what he
called the natural links between sex and war did not restore
discipline, but encouraged degeneration. Books, he argued, should no
longer be censored according to abstract formulations of good and
evil, but rather, according to changing social and cultural mores
which themselves determined which books "cool" passions. Haraucourt's
aim of cooling passions was predictable. But the way he proposed to
achieve it--a flexible censorship grounded in loosely
defined mores rather than abstract moral laws--derived from
his conviction that in the Great War military discipline had 
heated rather than cooled passions. Men had been as excited by death
as they were because interdictions--in the form of overzealous
censorship and social taboos--against the "literature of
love" forced writers to focus on "the territory of
death"--"and they threw themselves into this territory with
passion. Fear was the supreme thrill."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 

<p>
These commentaries thus represent perversion (or suggest the lifting
of taboos against many erotic works) in order to prevent it,
dismembering bodies in order to restore their integrity. Material
which tells the truth about the war does not encourage the violent
sexuality inherent in human nature, but, oddly, exposes sexual 
violence in order to restore integral, phallic bodies. The sexuality
that was 
indissociable from the degradation of bodies is now indissociable from
their 
redemption. As Anquetil, Dumur, Lorulot and others saw it,
truth-telling renews 
patriotism. Such writing is labelled pornographic only by those men
responsible for the war--those with an investment in lying,
including perverts, corrupt politicians, and men out for commercial
gain. These critics thus reproduced the voyeuristic, sadomasochistic
pleasure they denounce, but did so in the interest of national and
moral regeneration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 It is perhaps no coincidence that
during the interwar years, Sade began to be revered as a moralist who
revealed our inhumanity to ourselves. That is,
Sade--according to a literary critical tradition initiated
by the surrealists and most forcefully expressed by Jean
Paulhan--sought to repel his readers in order to show them
the error of their ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 

<p>
In their effort to distinguish their work from pornography, however,
these writers confused the issue of what pornography was. Indeed,
Lorulot's and Anquetil's 
 <b></b> documentary and high moral style recalls the sensationalism of
novels replete with sadomasochistic content that have no such
pretensions: their writings detail the body's humiliation, how it is
bound, and where and how deep its wounds are. Commentators transformed
this confusion into the central meaning of pornography, thereby
denying pornography its status as a specific category of texts and
images. They used pornography instead to refer to a wide variety of
material whose only common attribute, according to them, was its
refusal to take a stand, to proclaim its meaning. 

<p>
The pseudonymous Balkis, whom Anquetil includes in a long chapter
euphemistically titled <I>"Nos Moeurs d'apr&egrave;s les
romanciers"</I> (Our Mores According to Novelists), quite literally
expressed this refusal of singular meaning. Balkis' "pornographic"
work <I>Personne</I> (No One) is an unnamed young woman's diary,
filled mostly with her sexual experiences and her reflections about
them. In one part of the "diary" its author muses: <I>"'Personne'</I>
represents me, perhaps, since I have never taken up a single posture
<I>[posture]</I> but a hundred of them, always leaving open the
possibility for others. No one, because being no one, I am necessarily
someone. . . . No one, since, changing form so easily, each form once
sketched is but the shadow of a form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The "no one" whose
diary might be anyone's, paradoxically desires "cerebral purification"
by humiliating others or being humiliated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Balkis not
only links sexual "postures" to the loss of self-definition, but also
yokes sexuality to the desire for self-purification; he
thus--in an apparently Catholic moment--conflates
self-loss and purity and compares "<I>personne</I>'s" pure self-loss
to the mentality of a general in the Great War. 

<p>
Anquetil denounces this desire for self-shattering purification when
he criticizes the book on the grounds that its author is perverted and
sadistic. In his view, the book is pornographic because it is really
about the possibilities of self-multiplication and not about
self-transcendence. In the part he chooses to excerpt,
<I>"personne"</I><B> </B>takes on a variety of different roles,
including Salome, and becomes "a woman just like all
women--no one." <I>"La petite fille"</I> who becomes a woman
in the course of the diary "has become a <I>gar&ccedil;onne,"</I>
meaning a nobody, or someone who doesn't know who she is.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

Like pornography, the discourse about purification is only a pretext
for having more sex, much in the same way that the war became a
pretext for more 
stimulation. Anquetil draws our attention to this dissimulation when
he singles out "<I>personne</I>'s" playing the part of Salome; that is
the moment when she most explicitly positions herself as "no one," as
an actress capable of playing multiple roles whose only identity is
her assumption of other identities. All the "pornographic novels of
our times" enact this self-multiplication, which in Anquetil's view
constitutes a misrepresentation: pornography is an act, a lie, filth
passing for purity, the pervert 
passing for a soldier. 

<p>
It might be useful to think of pornography not in terms of any
specific content, but rather, as an instantiation of Anquetil's
implicit claim that representation in postwar culture must always be
inadequate to its object, that pornography's meaning is precisely its
elusiveness, its refusal to "mean" anything in particular. Just before
and <b></b> certainly after the Great War, critics conceded again and
again that pornography was not what it used to be, meaning that
pornography was no longer contained and 
identifiable. Adolphe Thery wrote that at another time consumers of
pornography "themselves [had] recognized that material which crudely
addressed the senses . . . [or] 'obscene' work . . . must be hidden."
Today, however, "pornography is everywhere, and no place, however
sacred it is, remains completely closed, because [pornography] is a
supple, rich, intelligent enemy who hesitates before nothing . . .
"
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Writing in <I>La Vie Parisienne</I> on "The Progress of
Pornography," another critic wrote that there is "no longer any vice
that has not become the object of a specialized monograph," and that
those monographs can be found everywhere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

Anti-pornography forces in fact gave up the struggle against immoral
texts and acts themselves to battle instead the "contagion of
immorality," "the continual incitement to immorality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>


<p>
After the war, then, pornography defined material that no longer
remained behind the closed doors of rich men's studies and infiltrated
locales where it had no business being.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 No longer hidden,
pornography nevertheless eluded identification. Moreover, the tension
between pornography's apparent visibility and its surreptitious
infiltration of space--Thery wrote that it enters the
sanctity of the home "under a benign appearance"--produced
the narrative structure of an "open secret" in which the increasing
visibility of pornography intensified cultural fantasies about (and
surveillance of) its protean character.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 In marked
contrast to the late nineteenth century, when commentators blamed
immoral authors for pornography, now pornography was perfidious
because it represented a chain of "incitements" whose origin was
mysterious even as their effects were apparent to everyone. 

<p>
Certainly some writers blamed pornographers for trying to conceal
their "real" message from readers: Louis Bethleem claimed that
pornographers were mercenaries who hid the message of their work under
the cover of characters who seemed to have <I>"grandes
ames."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 In two different commentaries on Victor
Margueritte's scandalous <I>La Gar&ccedil;onne,</I> one critic wrote
that "what is even more comical is to see all this pornography
carefully woven, detailed, nuanced, pretending to moralize and
contemplate social vices."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 And Gustave Tery noted that
<I>La Gar&ccedil;onne</I> was pornographic because it was "dishonest"
and "treasonous."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 But this approach to the 
problem already implied that pornography was something that could be
concealed, that could conceal, as it unfolded before your eyes.
Indeed, in most accounts pornographic authors counted for little
because they had become agents of contamination, symptoms of an
epidemic that spared no one. Pornography took on a life of its own; it
appeared in different guises--Bethleem was upset because
pornography passed for literature--and was defined, like the
diarist<B> </B><I>personne,</I> only in terms of its ability to elude
definition. 

<p>
Hence Georges Fonsegrive, writing in 1911, claimed that pornography
was like a prostitute: it pretends to love without loving, "its
expressions are those of a body emptied of its soul, expressions
without meaning or purpose, expressions that define the singularity of
pornography." He suggested that pornography was dangerous
 <b></b> because it was no longer recognizable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Again,
Anquetil best captured (and produced) pornography's protean quality in
his condemnation of a poster inviting Parisians to a "ceremony" in
honor of the war-dead. The poster's title, <I>Monuments aux morts</I>
(Monuments to the Dead), was misleading. In fact, when you read the
fine print, it suggested you join a group of party-goers to spend the
evening dancing, or rather, two-stepping like soldiers. Anquetil
denounced such irreverence. He did not use the incident, however, to
condemn immoral youth, but to denounce a pornographic culture in which
it was possible for young people to conflate exhausting dancing and
exhausting combat.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Pornography, then, is not just
immoral, but represents the impossibility of determining the
distinction between immorality and morality. In the interwar years,
writers at once transformed pornography into an elastic category of
meaning and gave it a negative valence.

<p>
All the writers I have discussed were emphatic about the patriotic
intent of their works and certain that their patriotism was
self-evident to readers not duped by politicians' lies or emasculated
by abnormal desires and perceptions. By contrast, for them,
pornography expressed the loss of the boundary between free will and
compulsion and hence the loss of the singular, redemptive meaning once
ascribed to patriotic self-sacrifice.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 It is still not
clear, however, what distinguishes their work from the work they call
pornographic: Anquetil's and others' invocation of sexual activity and
of eroticized violence in particular is, as I have suggested, not
clearly differentiated from similar invocations in so-called
pornography. Anquetil himself accuses Louis Dumur of exploiting the
war for mercenary gain, whereas Dumur defended himself--as
we have seen--against all accusations of pornography. 

<p>
This elasticity explains, I think, the now extraordinary descriptive
breadth of the "pornographic"--no longer confined to
"pornography," a clearly identifiable category of material against
which one could legislate. As documents from police archives
demonstrate, the description and prosecution of pornographic material
in France after the Great War was inconsistent, incoherent, and aimed
at an increasingly wider variety of material.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 At the same
time, many writers' efforts to draw the boundary between redemptive
literature and pornography in new terms indicates that they defined
pornography's negative valence in terms of its perceived challenge to
clear dichotomies of truth and falsehood, morality and immorality, and
masculinity and femininity. Any analysis of changing definitions of
the pornographic thus suggests not only the centrality of sexuality to
new definitions of subjectivity, but marks the transformation of the
terms in which rational subjectivity has been constructed.

After the appearance of Linda Williams's important book <I>Hard
Core: Power, Pleasure, and the Frenzy of the Visible</I> (Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1989), critics' focus shifted away
from mostly negative assessments of pornography's social effects to
analyses of the medium itself. In that book, Williams compared
pornographic films to Hollywood musicals, and demonstrated that
pornography employed specific narrative conventions like any other
genre. Moreover, she argued that although those conventions affirm
normative heterosexuality, they also create new forms of sexual
subjectivity. Williams and others have thus insisted that to the
extent that pornography is one of the ways we make sense of and
produce sexuality it is not--as even some of its most avid
defenders feel compelled to assert--intrinsically worthless.
Walter Kendrick has argued that pornography has no intrinsic meaning
and is best defined as material which social elites deem dangerous
should it fall outside their purview. This is a useful point of
departure but neglects, as Williams argued, the fact that pornographic
films constitute a genre with their own diegetic structures.

Some recent work has addressed the development of eroticized
violence. Anne McLintock notes that Foucault suggested that
sadomasochism was born at the end of the eighteenth century and she
links this insight to "the emergence of imperialism in its modern
industrial form." This insight conforms to descriptive accounts of the
relationship between British Imperialism and British flagellation
pornography written during the interwar years, although I do not know
whether such a relationship was presumed in the nineteenth century.
McLintock never makes the relationship between the "ritual subculture
of S/M" and imperialism clear.

<p>
In a fascinating essay, Karen Halttunen argues that eroticized
violence emerged as the underside of the new late eighteenth-century
culture of sentimentalism: as violence became increasingly taboo it
emerged in eroticized, pornographic form. Both arguments presume that
"the pornography of pain" ultimately reflects a moral failure or
immoral or pathological desire (in Halttunen, it represents the
necessity of transgressing new cultural taboos); McLintock argues
correctly that late Victorian scientists "demonized S/M as the
psychopathology of the atavistic individual, a blood flaw and stigma
of the flesh." (She does not address pornography <I>per se.)</I> See

In this essay, I am interested in a different historical moment in
which pornography's meaning becomes indeterminate.

their cadavers floating together downstream (<I>Sur le Fleuve

Moreover, many postwar novels did away with the restrained,
aestheticized voluptuousness of late-nineteenth-century
sadomasochistic ritual best described by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's
<I>Venus in Furs</I>--its aristocratic decor, its props and
fetishes, its calculated and cold violence. Instead, sadomasochism
loses its theatrical quality and becomes atrocious because the
violence is transparent. In Marcello Fabri's <I>Visage du vice,</I>
two women eviscerate each other, and the violence is not--as
in earlier accounts of lesbian sadism--mediated by the
contrast between passion and aristocratic countenance, or by
calculation (e.g. the vial of poison by the bed). Although one of the
characters is a "rich banker's daughter," this does not structure the
scene but indicates only that--in another bow to
conventional tropes--lesbians are wealthy (quoted in
Anquetil, <I>Satan Conduit le bal,</I> 314). The character's wealth
(the capital symbolized by her body) is intended to intensify her
degradation, but it does not, oddly, aestheticize the violence done to
her body. There are countless other novels just like this one.

In a recent and compelling article about the French government's
narrative about German soldiers' rape of "enemy" women during the
Great War, Ruth Harris argues that "[n]ormally the stuff of
pornography, such sadistic visions became an integral aspect of
patriotic discourse and, I would argue, a means of projecting a range
of anxieties onto an eroticized vision of the mutilated female form"
(Ruth Harris, "The 'Child of the Barbarian': Rape, Race and
Nationalism in France During the First World War" <I>Past and
Present</I> 141 [November 1993]: 188). I am interested in how exactly
pornography became an integral aspect of patriotic discourse. In order
to investigate this avenue, I cannot, as Harris does, assume the
self-evident status of pornography. Moreover, my research has led me
away from an obsession with the mutilated female form to a
preoccupation with the mutilated male self. Harris does emphasize the
extent to which Frenchmen identified with these images of mutilated
women insofar as they came to represent violated France herself.

<p>
One of the most potent images of and among acculturated Jews at the
turn of the nineteenth century is the image of the "smart Jew." Jewish
savants of the time come to be ambivalent in regard to their own
position as intellectuals as they internalize the image of their
questionable "superior intelligence." Jews, according to the common
wisdom of the time among many non-Jews, are crafty rather than clever.
Thus in the standard American phrenological text at midcentury, Samuel
R. Wells's <I>New Physiognomy, or, Signs of Character: As Manifested
Through Temperament,</I> the Jew's physical appearance is the guide to
his mercenary character.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Wells speaks of the fact that
"the more cultivated and advanced the race, the finer the nose"
(<I>NP,</I> 189). Yet the Jew's nose has not changed after millennia.
It shows a "worldly shrewdness, insight into character, and ability to
turn insight into profitable account" (<I>NP,</I> 196). It is a sign
of "commercialism" (<I>NP,</I> 196). "The Jew has a larger head than
the Arab, and at present undoubtedly stands at the head of the Semitic
sub-races" because of his intelligence (<I>NP,</I> 445). His
intellectual qualities are clear: "He is religious; he is fond of
trade; he is thrifty; he is unconquerably true to his racial
proclivities; he is persistent in everything he undertakes"
(<I>NP,</I> 445). He is also "prejudiced, bigoted, stern, stubborn,
irascible, exacting, secretive, and unrelenting" (<I>NP,</I> 445).
This is the general understanding of Jewish superior intelligence in
the late nineteenth century, with intelligence simply masking bad
character. Bad character, in turn, is manifested in the Jew's innate
inability to be original in the creative arts, where he makes the
claim for his own originality. The Jew, in short, is shrewd rather
than creative. <b></b> 

<p>
Once internalized, such images lead to intense self-doubt about one's
own intelligence and creativity. One example of this position as a
<I>negative</I> formulation is the self-doubt that Victor Adler,
cofounder of the Austrian Socialist Party, evidenced in a letter he
wrote to his political ally Karl Kautsky on 21 August 1886: "I do not
have the calling for a quiet, scholarly occupation. I believe myself
quite useful as a copier of the ideas of others. We Jews seem
predestined to copy others' ideas."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 This 
version of the notion of a Jewish intellect that is condemned to be a
"parasite" on the real intellectuals of the "host" culture is a
commonplace in the anti-Semitic literature of the day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

Adler acts this out in his rejection of any Jewish specificity within
his complicated understanding of national identity and national
language. The Jews are clever, according to Adler, but not smart. And
only true intelligence can be understood as a sign of civic virtue.
This typical rereading frames the question of Jewish intelligence in
Vienna during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

<p>
The Viennese context seems to be especially rich in these cases of
self-doubt 
concerning Jewish intelligence as creative rather than parasitic. As
the city believed to be the most anti-Semitic in Central Europe and
the one in which the Jewish visibility as intellectuals was very high,
one would expect the reading of Jewish intelligence to have an intense
and evident form. Robert Wistrich noted that "the main components of
Austrian anti-Semitism, its multinational character, agitational
techniques, and mass impact, were distinctly novel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 There
was a general assumption in Vienna that there was a "Jewish mind" that
transcended conversion or adaptation and that this mind was inherently
unoriginal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In the writings of a number of Viennese Jewish
(however this is defined) intellectuals of the turn of the century,
one can see a wide range of the positions involving the
internalization of the question of Jewish intelligence; these
positions are linked in striking and rather unusual ways. This is not
a specifically "Viennese" problem; rather, for creative individuals in
a city in which the <I>Bildungsb&uuml;rgertum,</I> the intellectual
middle class, was defined by ideas of originality and creativity, this
quality of mind came to be central in the self-definition of those
labeled or self-labeled as Jews.

<p>
The tone is set in what is without a doubt the most important Viennese
contribution by a Jew to the question of the racial identity of the
Jews. Ignaz Zollschan's study, <I>Das Rassenproblem unter besonderer
Ber&uuml;cksichtigung der theoretischen Grundlagen der j&uuml;dischen
Rassenfrage</I> (The race problem, considered particularly in view of
the theoretical foundations of the Jewish race problem), first
appeared in Vienna in 1912. Zollschan, a Jewish physician whose strong
support of political Zionism made him an opponent of Nazi racial
anthropology, redirects the Jewish question in two specific ways. He
is interested first in determining the racial value of the Jews--do
the Jews make a fruitful cultural and economic contribution to the
lands in which they live? Secondly, he questions whether it is
possible to speak of a discrete Jewish race, marked by particular
qualities that predetermine their historical path. In both areas, the
question of Jewish superior intelligence is a touchstone of his
arguments. He draws on anthropological and historical research in
developing his views. <b></b> 

<p>
In order to address the anti-Semitic claim that Jews lack originality
and 
productivity, Zollschan takes a comparative approach, asking whether
these qualities can be recognized in all peoples except the Jews.
Zollschan suggests that the anthropological basis erected to support
most contemporary racial theory is an utter fabrication. While
recognizing that the Germans seemed to be in possession of all of the
qualities necessary to see themselves as superior, Zollschan deflates
the idea that these qualities are inherent in the German people. The
qualities of bravery, morality, uprightness, and truthfulness are not
inherited from the Germanic tribes. The presence of any degree of
these qualities in the Germanic tribes (and the German people through
the ages) was the result of the utilitarian function of these
qualities--the Germanic tribes could utilizes these "virtues," as it
were, as they suited their needs. Moreover, Zollschan argues, at no
time did the Germans hold a monopoly on these positive qualities. The
presence of these qualities in twentieth-century Germans is not
inherent, but instead acquired through hard cultural work <I>("in
m&uuml;hsamer Kulturarbeit errungen").</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Thus Jews too
could achieve the status of "smart Germans" through their work in and
contribution to the cause of <I>Bildung</I> (culture).

<p>
But adding to the virtue of culture only works if the necessary
biological substrata is present. Zollschan's theory of intellect is
bound up with his general racial theory in complicated ways.
Intelligence is racially determined, and not impacted by environment:
"Character, quality of genius and the quantity of genius is determined
by race. While the character and the quality of genius may be
determined and modified by the environment and eventually through free
will, the <I>quantity of genius</I> is the 
single constant in all environments" (<I>R,</I> 233; Zollschan's
emphasis). That is, whereas "talent can be cultivated, genius arises
with the power of a drive or instinct" (<I>R,</I> 274); one is born,
not educated, to genius. Germans as well as Jews have an innate 
intellectual ability, but it must be cultivated.

<p>
Central to Zollschan's view is the question of why a people is
predisposed toward a particular mode of thought. His answer is that
this stems from an inherited <I>mneme.</I> Zollschan argues that the
<I>mneme</I> that determine psychic instincts are not equally 
distributed among various races (<I>R,</I> 279). The Jews show a
superior intelligence, not only because of their inherent biological
nature but also because they are a pure race; they have not diluted
their intellectual abilities. The intellect is the antithesis of the
drives, the rational. For Zollschan, genius involves the overcoming of
one's instincts. (He distinguishes between instinct and intellect,
designating them 
respectively as "intuition" and "intellect.") Such an overcoming
succeeds only if one is descended from the right racial stock. Thus
this overcoming of instincts is a process whose results vary in mixed
and pure races: "Overcoming instincts is relatively easy in crossed
races . . . for the great segments are so disparate that truly deep
instincts that could be difficult to overcome are not present.
Brilliant but not 
profound intelligence is often found here, but deeper insight is
rarely found" (<I>R,</I> 295). Pure races, on the other hand, show
"brilliant intuition" and "creativity." Zollschan thus projects the
image of the clever Jew onto the individual of mixed race. The space
of the <I>Mischling,</I> the mixed-race individual, becomes the locus
of <b></b> faulty Jewish intelligence. Its faultiness is not the direct
result of Jewish racial 
qualities, but ostensibly because of the irresponsible (and thus
un-Jewish) acts of intermarriage and/or conversion from Jewishness.
This is a pivotal point in Zollschan's argument, and I will explore
its dynamic below. He locates the "source" of the charge that Jewish
intellect is merely cleverness. This projection onto a subgroup of
Jews is a classic move on the part of Jewish scientists dealing with
the charges of racial difference at the fin de si&egrave;cle.

<p>
Zollschan is thus able to spend the last two hundred pages of his
study documenting the "creativity of the Jews." For Zollschan, pure
races (Germans or Jews) are creative races. The centerpiece of this
final section, however, is not simply a rehearsal of "great men" or a
tallying of the relative statistical pre&euml;minence of Jewish
superior intelligence (although both appear). Instead, we find this
material shored up in a complex refutation of the charge of Jewish
unoriginality. This version of the argument centers around the notion
of Jewish parasitism, which was first made in the "scientific"
anti-Semitic literature by Eugen D&uuml;hring (whom Zollschan cites),
and contends that Jews have made no independent contribution to
civilization. The virtue of originality marked the idea of "genius"
even in late nineteenth-century 
scientific thought, and the charge of parasitism carried great
resonance in Vienna, a city in which the link between the original and
the creative was absolute. According to this view, all of the Jewish
contributors to culture are "exploiters, arrogant upstarts, and moral
perverts" (<I>R,</I> 369). We recognize this discourse as another way
of speaking about the modern, but the modern is here understood as
Jewish, and therefore as derivative. This is the same creativity that
Zollschan's contemporaries in Vienna most doubted in themselves and
that becomes one of the means of understanding the self-doubt not only
of the Jew, but especially, as we shall see, of the mixed-race writers
at the turn of the century.

<p>
Central to Ignaz Zollschan's argument for Jewish superior intelligence
was the projection of the image of the clever Jew onto the re of
the <I>Mischling,</I> the mixed-race individual. Indeed, this
distinction between the Jew and the <I>Mischling</I> provided a field
onto which derogatory projections of Jewish cleverness could be made
by those who defined themselves as "pure" Jews. Such a definition was
rooted in the perceived double betrayal through conversion away from
Judaism and intermarriage. But what of those individuals--who now
belonged to the non-Jewish majority in terms of their religious
self-definition--onto whom this idea of Jewish cleverness was
projected? Steven Beller has noted that no one in Vienna "could escape
the social stigma of being a Jew by conversion, or even by being only
partly Jewish" (<I>VJ,</I> 205). At the fin de si&egrave;cle,
converting and intermarrying were said to produce specific 
qualities of mind. Jewish irony is a weapon by which "the baptized Jew
takes vengeance upon the God of the Christians and upon their social
system, for the disgrace of compulsory baptism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This
literally cut to the definition of the Jew as exemplified by the
fin-de-si&egrave;cle reading of, for example, Heinrich Heine. As with
the myth of all "crossbreeds," the worst qualities of the inferior
race surfaces: "The 
children of such marriages [between Jews and non-Jews] . . . even
though they are <b></b> so very beautiful and so very talented, seem to
lack a psychological balance that is provided by pure racial stock. We
find all too often intellectually or morally unbalanced individuals,
who decay ethically or end in suicide or madness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 There
is no place one can hide; there is no means of becoming invisible.
Thus such children are degenerate and "black."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The
Viennese critic Ottokar Stauf von der March observed in regard to the
highly aestheticized products of the fin de si&egrave;cle that "the
greatest number of the decadents are Semites, at least according to
their descent, and Jewry today finds itself at the stage of a physical
and psychic decadence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The issue of this decay was
manifested in the debate over the virtue of the Jews as citizens in
modern society. And that "blackness," as we have seen throughout the
discussions of race in this context, is related to a mode of
diminished or damaged intelligence--to cleverness rather than
intelligence.

<p>
Certainly a major literary representation of this trope is present in
William Thackeray's novel <I>Vanity Fair</I> (1847-48), which was
as much a part of the German as of the Anglophone canon in the
nineteenth century; Thackeray, who saw himself as more German than the
Germans, became one of the classic British authors in midcentury
Germany. In the very first chapter of <I>Vanity Fair,</I> we are
introduced to a Miss Schwartz, "the rich woolly-haired mulatto from
St. Kitts," who goes "in[to] downright hysterics" when Amelia Sedley
and Becky Sharp leave school.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 She is depicted as neither
very bright nor very talented. She retains her "primitive" love of
ornament, wearing "her favorite amber-coloured satin with turquoise
bracelets, countless rings, flowers, feathers, and all sorts of tags
and gimcracks, about as 
elegantly decorated as a she chimney-sweep on May-day" (<I>VF,</I>
200). This hysterical type is a <I>Mischling</I> in the German sense
of the word, as her German name, Schwartz--"black"--suggests. Yet her
patrimony is not exclusively German, but Jewish: "Her father was a
German Jew--a slave-owner they say--connected with the Cannibal
Islands in some way or another," who has died and left his children a
large inheritance (<I>VF,</I> 194). Schwartz is an anomaly within the
novel, an exotic whose 
sexuality exceeds her class, a re whose sexuality and body
threaten to be uncontained by economic markers. Even her wealth cannot
compensate for her otherness; George Osborne therefore rejects an
economically lucrative match with her, exclaiming: "Marry that mulatto
woman? . . . I don't like the colour, sir. Ask the black that sweeps
opposite Fleet Market, sir. <I>I'm</I> not going to marry a Hottentot
Venus" (<I>VF,</I> 204). The reference to the Hottentot Venus evokes
the body of the African woman, Sarah Bartmann, with her "primitive
sexuality," and foreshadows the eugenicist Francis Galton's trip to
Africa a decade later, where he "discovers" the presumed link between
race and intelligence. But the re of Miss Schwartz also looks
backward to a literary reworking of the <I>Mischling</I>'s atavism, in
addition to evoking, within the German context, the German Jew's
supposed willingness, even eagerness, to cross racial lines because of
her or his innate sexual difference.

<p>
In 1909 Max Warwar published a biting feuilleton on the front page of
the Zionist <I>Selbstwehr,</I> a periodical that Franz Kafka read
fervently and occasionally wrote for. <b></b> Warwar bemoans <I>"Der
Flucht vor dem Typus,"</I> the flight from the type, that is, the
anxiety of Jews about their own bodies as signs of their inherent
difference. "There are reportedly Jews," writes Warwar,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
who stand for hours before the mirror and like vain women observe
their exterior with jealousy and distaste, complaining against nature
that had so irrationally formed them in the light of the laws of their
development. These Jews feel their profile as a brand of shame, and
suffer for they have not learned to experience what is there as
beautiful.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
These male Jews are likened to women, but women who are constantly
unhappy with what nature has provided them in the way of beauty. They
are ashamed of their own "type," which according to the Zionist Warwar
is pure; nonetheless these Jews act as if their bodies represented a
mixed type. Some try to escape their bodies through conversion, what
Warwar calls "crawling to the cross," but this attempt is doomed to
failure; these Jews do not acquire any respect for their own "external
being" from the "other" through conversion ("FT," 1-2).
Conversion is in fact not an escape from race, since the desire to
appear like the "other" ("FT," 1-2) is what motivates the craving
for what are simply superficial transformations. What they wish to
escape is the physical embodiment of the "Jewish type," being a "true,
black-haired Jew" ("FT," 1-2). Blackness again marks the Jews as
different in Prague. Blackness, for Warwar, is a sign of the pure
type, a sign of inherent difference. These "black Jews," which Warwar
sees echoed in the singer's self-representation in the <I>Song of
Songs,</I> can be beautiful: "For the soul even of the blackest of
Jews can be as pure as gold" ("FT," 1-2). And indeed the
blackness of the Jew is properly the erotic center of attraction:
"Perhaps it is this very fire that burns in the eyes of Jewish men and
women, that extends an inescapable attraction to all that come close
to it. And the blacker such a type is, the more demonic and darker the
fires burn in the eyes, and the more intimate the magic that such a
Jew can exude." Warwar sees, however, that this is precisely
<I>not</I> the case in contemporary Prague. There the sexual
attraction to such a "type" is felt only by "Christians, Teutons, and
Romans," rather than by Jews ("FT," 1-2). This attraction leads,
in turn, to crossing racial boundaries, and the creation of mixed
racial types. According to this argument, Jews must remain true to
their own "type," to their own body, and to their cultural difference
as "Orientals" ("FT," 1-2). And, again, Orientals are simply
clever, not smart.

<p>
Two fin-de-si&egrave;cle writers who provide some insight into this
anxiety about mixed identity as the source of Jewish cleverness are
the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal and the philosopher Ludwig
Wittgenstein. They exemplify the problems of internalization of the
myth of a corrupt Jewish intelligence. Both are members of the
Viennese upper class, and belong to long-established Christian
families. Their respective 
anxieties are not simply the result of a generalized sense of the
corruption of the Jewish intellect. They are, rather, symptomatic of
having internalized a set of beliefs 
involving the trope of creative impotence resulting from the pollution
of the productive <b></b> Aryan spirit by the reflective Jewish one. It
is this fear--the fear of being 
neither the possessor of a Jewish superior intelligence nor the
proprietor of the Aryan's creative drive--that underlies Zollschan's
image of the <I>Mischling.</I> This double projection, from the side
of the Jew as well as from the anti-Semite, provides a <I>huit
close</I> for the Jews of mixed race in Vienna.

<p>
Of all of the creative res of the fin de si&egrave;cle, none is
more complex and more secretive about his anxiety concerning his
hidden, corrupting "Jewishness" than Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
Hofmannsthal's account of this anxiety begins in 1893 when he is only
nineteen years old.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 He writes in his diary: "If my entire
inner 
development and struggle was nothing more than the disturbance of
inherited blood, the revolts of the Jewish droplets of blood
(reflection) against the Germanic and Roman, and the reactions against
these rebellions" ("AH," 214). Jewishness for Hofmannsthal, who was
raised a Catholic and had one Jewish grandparent, is a state of mind,
but a state of mind that is a block to his self-definition as a poet.
Real 
poetry is not embodied by Heinrich Heine in this particular
conration, but rather by the Symbolists, specifically by Stefan
George, with his strong sense of the limited role that Jews could take
in the "real" world of the poetic. "Jews," George writes, "are
certainly clever in propagating and translating values. But they do
not experience them as elementary as do we. They are totally different
people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Could Hofmannsthal fit into this world? Only if
he was able to keep his clever but superficial side under control. In
1899 he wrote about his future Jewish brother-in-law Fritz
Schlesinger: "Nevertheless I see without any pleasure--alongside his
nice, open, rather sensitive character--a specific tendency developing
to reflection, to the 'critical,' 'historical,' 'objective,'
empathetic and appreciatively educated Jewish manner of thought, which
is so bloodless of life and contains within it the potential to lose
the ability to experience" ("AH," 214). Hofmannsthal's fear is of
being "Talmudic," of falling from the grace of experience onto the
ground of mind. Jews think differently; they do not, cannot, think
poetically, according to Hofmannsthal (and, of course, George). 

<p>
The moral component of Jewish creative difference can be judged in the
comments of another member of the George circle, the poet and
translator Rudolf Borchardt, a Jewish writer whose grandparents had
converted to Protestantism in Prussia long before his birth in 1877.
Defamed by George as "<I>Mauschel</I>-Pindar," a "Pindar with a Jewish
accent," the poet became one of the key res in the debate about
Jewish self-hatred carried on in the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 As early as
1915 Borchardt was making a careful distinction between materialist
writers who are merely "craftsmen" and who "procure necessary psychic
costumes," and the real poet, "the moral 
person." Materialist writers are the Jews in Borchardt's system; only
pure, creative, nonmaterialist authors are truly
virtuous.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Thus the reading of creativity in these writers
of "mixed race" is reread in terms of virtue.

<p>
But the Catholic, upper-class, conservative poet Hugo von
Hofmannsthal, like Borchardt, was himself seen as or at least heard to
be a Jew, certainly as much as was his Jewish brother-in-law. It was
the Jew within that spoke when Hofmannsthal appeared in the artistic
circles of Vienna. Leopold von Adrian, Hofmannsthal's friend <b></b> and,
like him, the offspring of a mixed marriage, commented that when
Hofmannsthal spoke, he did so with a strong Viennese accent, speaking
through his nose. Yet "in certain moments of excitement, he spoke in
the accent of the Jews, but I don't know why, like the lowest of them,
the kikes." In addition, Hofmannsthal was described by Adrian as being
as "sensitive as a hysterical woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Hofmannsthal is
thus the very embodiment of the noncreative spirit. Paradoxically,
however, Adrian exempts himself from this predicament; the wellspring
of his own creativity is found in his position as a gay artist, which
is the "sole and happiest result of the mixing of two advanced
races."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 As the son of the daughter of the German-Jewish
composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, Adrian saw himself as having inherited the
cultural capital that made him who he was. He simply reversed the
poles of Hofmannsthal's argument, seeing his difference as the result
of his inheritance. Hofmannsthal, however, was unable to do this, and
remained locked into the notion that his mixed-race identity was his
hidden flaw--the error of a "Talmudic," sterile rationality.

<p>
For Adrian everyone who made art in Vienna (with the exception of
Hermann Bahr) was a Jew (<I>VJ,</I> 205). While Adrian heralds this,
Hofmannsthal's need is to separate out his art--real art--from the
locus of Jewish art. The Jewish tendency that haunts Hofmannsthal's
world assumes an alternate form, equally antithetical: the tendency
toward the "modern." The modern is, for Hofmannsthal, found in "a 
specific intellectual Jewish milieu in Vienna," which is "a mollusk-
and parasite-world," the antithesis "of the society that is
represented in my poetry--and this is the element at least of my and
the Austrian world"("AH," 218). The modern is, of course, as
antirational as Hofmannsthal, but it is "destructive" rather than
"constructive," in his own poetical/political terms. The circle is
complete: if he accepts the projection of a Jewish cleverness that is
the product of the mixing of races, he projects this accusation of
Jewish cleverness and lack of creativity onto the modern, which is in
turn Jewish. Hofmannsthal's case is one in which the anxiety about
identity remains a private matter, playing itself out in the complex
formation of his art and his politics. This secret stain of the Jewish
is found in another Viennese intellectual, whose comments bring us up
to the very moment before the Shoah.

<p>
The Anglo-Jewish novelist Frederic Raphael has suggested in a review
of my <I>Jewish Self-Hatred</I> that the model of the anxiety about
language and the claim of Jewish intellectuals to a new, universal
language would be well illustrated by Ludwig Wittgenstein's rejection
of "private language."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 This is true, and in unexpected
and complex ways. Wittgenstein's self-doubts about his creativity as a
thinker are linked to the Viennese model of a damaged and damaging
Jewish intelligence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 According to a contemporary
commentator, for Wittgenstein Jewishness is more "an intellectual than
a moral limitation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 But for a philosopher, such a
limitation would seem to be catastrophic: what good is a philosopher
who is not "smart"? Yet writing philosophy for Wittgenstein is never
understood as creative in the same light as, for example, his
brother's ability to play the piano. He writes out the anxiety over
his intellectual 
creativity in private, as does Hofmannsthal, but, as with
Hofmannsthal, it comes to <b></b> be reflected in his writing, his idea
of philosophy, and the cold, spare, seemingly transparent language of
the philosopher. 

<p>
Here, too, the question raised earlier, the question of mixed race and
converts, again emerges. Despite having three Jewish grandparents,
Wittgenstein always 
presented himself as a Christian with one Jewish grandparent; he
always assumed, however, that "they knew about me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 His
philosophy may also be read as a radical attempt to rewrite such
doubts into a philosophy of language that is itself beyond 
language. Wittgenstein's comments and aphorisms on Jewish superior
intelligence were published posthumously and provide a rich palate for
his understanding of Jewish cleverness.

<p>
Reinforced, if not first articulated, by his formative reading of Otto
Weininger's <I>Sex and Character</I> , Wittgenstein's sense of
the limitations of Jewish intelligence was palpable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 For
Wittgenstein, Weininger served as a classic representative of Jewish
superior intelligence, but one that did not fit into the "normal"
categories of Western thought: "In western civilization the Jew is
always measured on scales which do not fit him. . . . So at one time
they are overestimated, at another underestimated. Spengler is right
in this connection not to classify Weininger with the 
philosophers [thinkers] of the West."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 According to this
view, as thinkers Jews are different from their Western counterparts.
And yet the Western tradition, as we have seen, is defined as a "pure"
tradition. Weininger cannot be a "real" philosopher because, following
the model of the intellectual <I>Mischling,</I> he has abandoned the
rootedness of the Jew. His conversion is a sign, therefore, of his
mixed and, therefore, different intelligence.

<p>
For Weininger, of course, "Jewishness" of mind is an attribute shared
by a wide range of thinkers--it is simply the counterweight to the
Aryan spirit, a "pure" pole in opposition to the pole of "Aryan"
thought. Yet for Weininger everyone is "mixed"; everyone has some
attributes of the Jew and the Aryan. One is defined simply by the
dominant tendency. In the view of Weininger, even Wagner represented
the Jewish mindset, since his mindset showed a predominantly "Jewish"
cast. Wittgenstein's reading of this was clear. Thus Wittgenstein can
write that "Rousseau's character has something Jewish about it"
(&#167;20e - 1931). This "something Jewish" is the quality of mind
associated with the different and the pathological. Wittgenstein's
appropriation of this model, though, transformed it. 

<p>
Jewishness--even in Weininger--is always a lack, whether in non-Jews
or Jews: "What does Mendelssohn's music lack? A 'courageous' melody?"
(&#167;35e - 1939-40) Mendelssohn as the Jewish composer par
excellence lacks rigidity, lacks strength, lacks courage and therefore
is in no way sublime. "You get tragedy where the tree, instead of
bending breaks. Tragedy is something un-Jewish. Mendelssohn is, I
suppose, the most untragic of composers." (&#167;1e - 1929)
Mendelssohn comes to represent in music the essence of Jewish creative
lack. It's unsurprising that Wittgenstein evokes the standard litany
of smart or talented Jews in this lament over his own lack of
creativity. What is interesting is that, like Hofmannsthal, he clearly
understands himself as sharing in, as implicated by, this lack. <b></b> 

<p>
Wittgenstein could comment as late as 1931 about Jewish thinkers
including himself that

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Amongst Jews "genius" is found only in the holy man. Even the greatest
of Jewish thinkers is no more than talented. (Myself for instance.)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I think there is some truth in my idea that I really only think
reproductively. I don't believe I have ever <I>invented</I> a line of
thinking. I have always taken one over from someone. I have
straight-away seized on it with enthusiasm for my work of
clarification. That is how Boltzmann, Hertz, Schopenhauer, Frege,
Russell, Kraus, Loos, Weininger, Spengler, Sraffa have influenced me.
Can one take the case of Freud and Breuer as an example of Jewish
reproductiveness?--What I invent are new <I>similes.</I> . . .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The Jew must see to it that, in a literal sense, "all things are as
nothing to him." But this is particularly hard for him, since in a
sense he has nothing that is peculiarly his. It is much harder to
accept poverty willingly when you have to be poor than when you might
be rich.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It might be said (right or wrongly) that the Jewish mind does not have
the power to produce even the tiniest blade of grass; its way is
rather to make a drawing of the flower or blade of grass that has
grown in the soil of another's mind and to put it into a comprehensive
picture. We aren't pointing to a fault when we say this and everything
is all right as long as what is being done is quite clear. It is only
when the nature of a Jewish work is confused with that of a non-Jewish
work that there is any danger, especially when the author of the
Jewish work falls into the confusion himself, as he so easily may.
(Doesn't he look as proud as though he had produced the milk himself?)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is typical for a Jewish mind to understand someone else's work
better than he understands it himself. [&#167;18e-&#167;19e -
1931]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
The Jewish mind--and this includes his own--has no true originality
once it transgresses the boundary of the rootedness of the Jewish
genius, once it ceases to be pure within its own limitations. This is
Wittgenstein's answer to Weininger. It sees any "Jewish taint" as a
diminution of the overall quality of the pure race. Wittgenstein's
relationship to the concept of genius is also tied to his complex
reappropriation of "wit," the damning quality, for example, in Heine's
work that marks it as Jewish, as the sign of deep ambiguity. Wit, for
Wittgenstein, heralds the appearance of a language that calls for
interpretation at the same time that it marks interpretation as
nonsense. This is a recognizable form of "Jewish" argument, according
to the critics of Jewish superior intelligence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Thus it
is not that everyone is partially Jewish--following Weininger's
argument, an argument that rescues his own "mixed" status--but that
anyone who is partially Jewish is tainted by limited 
creativity. Thus for Wittgenstein, the "holy man" with his original
purity remains the model for Jewish superior intelligence. Here
Wittgenstein stands very much within <b></b> the tradition of Renan's
reading of the limits on Jewish creativity, the limitations of the
nomad wandering in the desert. Thus there is something hidden below
the 
surface: "The Jew is a desert region, but underneath its thin layer of
rock lies the molten lava of spirit and intellect." (&#167;13e - 1931)
This core is, of course, obliterated in the almost-Jew, in the
<I>Mischling</I> who can draw from neither the wellspring of Jewish
identity nor from that of Austrian culture. Jewish copies, mere
inventions, can be easily distinguished from true German art--as
Stefan George claims, by simply placing the copy next to the original.
The Jew is merely the mimicker of art.

<p>
Again Wittgenstein places himself in the catalogue of smart Jews. Here
it is Sigmund Freud and Joseph Breuer that are "examples of Jewish
reproductiveness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 They represent the Jewishness that is
merely the invention of what Wittgenstein calls "new <I>similes.</I>"
At the core of this lies the unauthentic, the unoriginal Jew, the Jew
as 
copyist:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
I believe that my originality (if that is the right word) is an
originality belonging to the soil rather than to the seed. (Perhaps I
have no seed of my own.) Sow a seed in my soil and it will grow
differently that it would in an other soil. Freud's originality too
was like this, I think. I have always believed--without knowing
why--that the real germ of psycho-analysis came from Breuer, not
Freud. Of course Breuer's seed-grain can only have been quite tiny.
<I>Courage</I> is always original. [&#167;36e - 1939-40] 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->

<p>
Breuer almost has courage, unlike Mendelssohn, because he is neither
of mixed race nor a convert. Unlike Freud, he does not abandon his
Jewish religious identity and come to advocate a radical atheism.
Breuer's originality has to do with that which is inexpressible, with
what--even in Freud's terms--is unknowable: his Jewishness. As Freud
stated in the 1934 preface to the Hebrew edition of <I>Totem and
Taboo:</I>

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
No reader of [the Hebrew version] of this book will find it easy to
put himself in the emotional position of an author who is ignorant of
the language of holy writ, who is completely estranged from the
religion of his fathers--as well as from every other religion--and who
cannot take a share in nationalist ideals, but who has yet never
repudiated his people, who feels that he is in his essential nature
<I>[Eigenart]</I> a Jew and who has no desire to alter that nature. If
the question were put to him: "Since you have abandoned all these
common characteristics <I>[Gemeinsamkeiten]</I> of your countrymen
<I>[Volksgenossen],</I> what is left to you that is Jewish?" he would
reply: "A very great deal, and probably its very essence." He could
not express that essence in words; but some day, no doubt, it will
become accessible to the scientific mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
The Jew is unknowable in his essence. Wittgenstein, however, pursues
the roots of this unknowability in the intellectual status of the
Jew. <b></b> 

<p>
According to Wittgenstein, the Jewish essence is the result of the
history of the Jews: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
It has sometimes been said that the Jews' secretive and cunning nature
is a result of their long persecution. This is certainly untrue; on
the other hand it is certain that they continue to exist despite this
persecution only because they have an inclination towards such
secretiveness. As we may say that this or that animal has escaped
extinction only because of its capacity or ability to conceal itself.
Of course I do not mean that as a reason for commending such a
capacity, not by any means. [&#167;22c - 1931]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
The essence of the Jew, the Jew's unknowability or
secretiveness--present even in the pure Jew--is different than that of
the Aryan. But even the essence of the Jew today has radically changed
from the spirit of the holy man wandering in the desert. History has
perverted the Jew, making the Jew lie; he has therefore become the bad
philosopher. Such a view echoes Wittgenstein's understanding that the
Jew in the world of the European represents disease and corruption.
The Jews are

<p><blockquote><!--_extract-->
experienced as a sort of disease, an anomaly, and no one wants to put
a 
disease on the same level as normal life and no one wants to speak of
a disease as if it had the same rights as healthy bodily processes
(even painful ones). We may say: people can only regard this tumor as
a natural part of the body if their whole feeling for the body changes
(if the whole national 
feeling for the body changes). Otherwise the best they can <I>do is
put up with</I> it. . . . There is a contradiction in expecting
someone both to retain his 
former aesthetic feeling for the body and <I>also</I> to make the
tumor welcome. [&#167;20e-21e - 1931]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
This image encapsulates Wittgenstein's anxiety about the Jew
within--the hidden Jew that will reveal himself once pen is set to
paper, once the spoken word is heard. But it is the anxiety of the
<I>Mischling</I> that haunts Wittgenstein's world. Jewish 
superior intelligence is the mark not of success but of failure. 

<p>
Vienna is the space where the problematic nature of Jewish response to
the meaning of Jewish superior intelligence can best be seen. The
image of the "smart Jew" at the end of the nineteenth and the
beginning of the twentieth centuries is so contested, so pathologized,
that Jewish intellectuals--no matter how they are defined--come to
understand themselves as "spoiled." The Zionists, such as Zollschan,
project this onto the "mixed-race" Jews; the <I>Mischlinge</I> such as
Hofmannsthal and Wittgenstein repress this charge, but integrate it
nonetheless as a frame for their self-understanding; the liberals,
such as Theodor Gomperz, project this anxiety about the absence of
creativity and virtue onto the historical Jews and eventually onto
themselves; the skeptics, such as Freud and Karl Abraham, wrestle with
their own creativity as Jews; the self-haters, such as Weininger, find
plenty of proof for their self-abnegation. Vienna <b></b> exemplifies
the locus of the negative reading of Jewish superior intelligence as
shaping how Jews understand their own intellect. Certainly, there are
reactions against this in Vienna. Theodore Herzl's reinterpretation of
Jewish intellect as "Oriental" genius is one such movement. And yet
the poison took root, with individual self-doubt becoming inextricably
tied to discourses about race in Vienna at the fin de si&egrave;cle.

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
By the term ambulatory automatism is understood a pathological
syndrome appearing in the form of intermittent attacks during which
the patient, carried away by an irresistible impulse, leaves his home
and makes an excursion or journey 
justified by no reasonable motive. The attack ended, the subject
unexpectedly finds himself on an unknown road or in a strange town.
Swearing by all the gods never again to quit his penates, he returns
home but sooner or later a new attack provokes a new
escapade.

<p>
Ambulatory automatism, by whatever name--<I>dromomanie</I>,
<I>poriomenie</I>, <I>Wandertrieb</I>, <I>determinismo
ambulatorio</I>, psychogenic fugue, or, in the parlance of the current
<I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual </I>of the American Psychiatric
Association, 
dissociative fugue--is exemplary for, even a caricature of,
late century madness. It is also a distorting mirror of one of the
middle class obsessions of the modern world, the world of Thomas Cook
and Son, the world of the comfortable traveller. For <I>les</I>
<I>alien&eacute;s voyageurs</I>--to use the title of the
first medical thesis about these men--were compulsive
travellers, solid artisans or honest men of the laboring classes, who
on hearing the name of a distant place would set out, on foot, or by
fourth class 
carriage, not knowing why they went. So far as casual passers-by could
tell, they behaved, en route, quite sensibly, yet they knew not what
they were doing, or, in some cases, who they were. That is the
prototype.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Rich men had fugues, and so did knaves, but the
central examples for nineteenth-century fugue were humble, decent men,
who remained humble and decent on their deliberate yet unwanted trips,
of which they later had <b></b> almost no memory. Hysteria has been
called the body language of female powerlessness. Fugue was a body
language of male powerlessness.

<p>
<I>Fugueurs</I> did not wander. They travelled with perseverance, in a
straight line, so to speak. At the end of 1899 a Swiss psychologist
published a once famous book about a middle-class medium, hysteria,
and multiple-personality: <I>From India to the Planet
Mars.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 This captured the imagination of a public
already dedicated to spiritualism and Thomas Cook. <I>Fugueurs,</I>
who were usually men of a more humble 
station in life, did not get to Mars, but they got to India, to
Moscow, to Algiers, or to Constantinople, although most were more
modest in their purposeful meaningless expeditions. <I>Fugueurs</I>
felt compelled, and were fixated on a single idea, a destination, a
variant, as would once have been said, of an <I>id&eacute;e fixe.</I>
They had but one idea, and yet when we look back at them a century
later, a whole cornucopia of ideas 
tumbles out. I shall manage to discuss, under the single heading of
fugue, not only hysteria but also multiple personalty, epilepsy,
hypnosis, the military, the vagrancy scare (or homeless men in the
1890s), the police, anti-Semitism (wandering Jews), photography, art
collectors, archaeology, the bicycle, the Olympic Games, and Proust.
People have gone on strange unmotivated trips forever, but at the time
when fugue became a medical entity, we had truly become modern.

<p>
Ambulatory automatism is an extreme example of a modern malady. It is
not quite extinct. It is parlous to identify any clinical diagnosis of
current psychiatric medicine with a mental illness from times gone by.
Who will say which complaints today match the florid hysteria of the
late nineteenth century? But plainly the official American definition
of dissociative fugue in 1994 was a lineal descendant of the slightly
more colorful definition of my epigraph, stated in Birdhouse a century
earlier: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
A. The predominant disturbance is sudden, unexpected travel away from
home or one's customary place of work, with inability to recall one's
past.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
B. Confusion about personal identity or assumption of new identity
(partial or complete). 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
C. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
Dissociative Identity Disorder (the new name for multiple personality
disorder) and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug abuse, a medication) or a general 
medical condition (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
D. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
The 1992 guidelines of the World Health Organization often sound more
sensible to the lay person than those of the American Psychiatric
Association. There we find a greater emphasis on amnesia. "For a
definite diagnosis," we are told, "there should be":

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
(a) the features of dissociative amnesia;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(b) purposeful travel beyond the usual everyday range (the
differentiation between 
travel and wandering must be made by those with local knowledge); and
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(c) maintenance of self care (eating, washing, etc.) and simple social
interaction with strangers (such as buying tickets or petrol, asking
directions, ordering meals).
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 <b></b> 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
<I>ICD-10</I> further explains that "although there may be amnesia for
the period of the fugue, the individual's behaviors during this time
may appear completely normal to independent observers."

<p>
A first respect in which dissociative fugue is exceptional is that
hardly any psychiatrist in the world today maintains that it is an
autonomous, free-standing mental 
illness. "Fugue episodes" are taken to be symptoms or behaviors
associated with other psychological or neurological problems. Yet if
you turn to the cited page in the standard, up-to-date American
<I>DSM-IV,</I> or European <I>ICD-10,</I> there it is, as if 
dissociative fugue were something you could simply have, like measles.
This 1994 diagnosis is a curious historical relic, grandfathered from
a past that psychiatrists have forgotten, the fugue epidemic of the
1890s.

<p>
Ambulatory automatism really was more autonomous in its homeland,
France, in a precisely defined period, 1887-1909. I am content to
make too fine a dating, in order to highlight how specific the ailment
was. The first celebrated case of fugue as a complaint in itself was
written up, in Bordeaux, in 1887.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Albert, the central
example, was an extraordinary compulsive traveller, who, like the
other men in his 
family, was employed by the local gas company. The last extended
discussion was at a psychiatric conference held in Nantes in
1909--a conference with two themes, fugue and desertion from
the army.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This was no accidental putting together of two
topics for a single meeting. In order to gain acquittals for some of
the hapless conscripts who deserted in peacetime, military doctors
would diagnose them as <I>fugueurs.</I>

<p>
We see from the <I>ICD-10</I> definition that fugue is, among other
things, a curious special case of the topic so well studied by Michael
Roth--forgetting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 We may even wonder why fugue
is not simply a species of amnesia--amnesia with travelling.
The distinction is enforced at present, by both <I>ICD-10</I> and
<I>DSM-IV,</I> not because fugue is somehow an independent disorder,
but because of how fugue and ambulatory automatism emerged as a
distinct disorder in the late nineteenth century. And here we have to
note another remarkable fact, that the psychiatric profession itself
exhibits a kind of collective amnesia. There is now a distinct
diagnosis, fugue, only because of what happened a century ago. Dozens
upon dozens of cases of fugue were published in France alone between
1887 and 1909, and there have been excellent recent survey articles in
the psychiatric literature, running through past cases. Yet in the
present systematic literature all but two of the nineteenth-century
studies have been lost, forgotten, abandoned.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>


<p>
For the primarily European <I>ICD-10,</I> the main problem for people
with dissociative disorders is amnesia. For the American
<I>DSM-IV,</I> the main problem is multiple personalty.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<I>DSM-IV</I> reminds us that fugue was not only a disorder of
forgetting but also, to a lesser extent, a disorder of personal
identity: "Confusion about personal identity or assumption of new
identity (partial or complete)." A definition is used to keep
dissociative fugue distinct from dissociative identity disorder
(multiple personality). A mere definition cannot draw a sharp line
between the two types of behavior, either now or a century ago.
Although complete identity confusion was rare, in the 1890s, there was
usually, during a fugue, at most a foggy sense of who <b></b> one was. In
particular, the <I>fugueur</I> tended to lose touch with exactly those
facts that bureaucrats use to identify us: proper name, place of
birth, domicile, married or 
single?, relatives, educational history, job. Compulsory identity
cards had not yet been introduced. <I>Fugueurs</I> crossing borders
would commonly carry some sort of passport, but, it seems, simply as a
way to cross borders, not as a token of identity.

<p>
Yet there is a fundamental difference between fugue and multiple
personality. You seldom find it stated explicitly in summaries of
clinical experience, although it might be smuggled in under the
discreet heading of "Epidemiology." The fact is that multiples are
women. <I>Fugueurs</I> are men.

<p>
Today there is a great cry among those who treat the dissociative
disorders: "Where are the men with multiple
personalities?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 This is because nine out of ten diagnosed
multiples are women. Why is this a question at all? Is a disorder
stigmatized by being "female"? Or is it rather that the practitioners
fear that the fact that nearly all recent multiples have been women
will be used as a ground for arguing that the disorders have been
suggested to their patients? Or that multiple personality, like
hysteria long ago, is less of a mental illness than a confused
expression of female powerlessness? At any rate, there has for some
years been a popular explanation for the missing male multiples. They
are, it is claimed, not in the mental health system, but in the
criminal justice system. Or, as we say in English, they are in jail.

<p>
One hundred years ago, it was also true that most persons diagnosed
with 
multiple personality were women. But there was an easy answer to the
question "where are the men?" The male multiples were out on trips. On
my account, almost exactly nine in ten fugueurs were men. The 1907
presidential address to the American Neurological Association stated
the matter more strongly. In the course of 
arguing that ambulatory automatism was a type of hysteria, the speaker
observed that:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Early on in my investigations I was struck by the enormous
preponderance of men. In the very considerable number of reported
cases, I have found only two women. . . . Why no ambulatory automatism
in women? . . . It is quite natural that a hysterical woman should not
go off on a long and complicated journey but, for her attack, should
have one of the "regular" manifestations of the disease.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Quite natural, indeed. Fugue is here seen as a male expression of
hysteria, a type of expression that it would be improper or dangerous
for a woman to adopt. It was no literary trope to say that fugue is
the body language of male powerlessness: here our neurologist implies
the same thing. Fugue was at the literal cutting-edge of hysteria. A
chief diagnostic issue, in 1890, was whether or not ambulatory
automatism was a type of hysteria or a type of epilepsy. The happy
hyphen in the then-common diagnosis, hystero-epilepsy, has to be
severed. A case of fugue had to be either hysterical or epileptic.
Hystero-epilepsy was replaced by hysteria/epilepsy, with a sharp
divide between them. <b></b> 

<p>
This is in itself a remarkable small tale in the history of
psychiatry. It is well known that although Charcot by no means
originated the notion of male hysteria, he did legitimate and
popularize it. He is also the man who gave us the label, ambulatory
automatism. So we might expect him to say that his men who took
irrational journeys confirmed the idea of male hysteria. Not at all.
Charcot fiercely and firmly diagnosed latent epilepsy. Even when there
were no seizures, and no family history, the trips of a man afflicted
with <I>automatisme</I> <I>ambulatoire</I> were "epileptic
equivalents." I won't do more than mention a couple of his arguments
here.

<p>
Charcot was a neurologist. He believed that hysteria was part of a
structure of hereditary defects, which could also include epilepsy and
alcoholism. It was produced by occasioning causes. In women these
could be emotional or moral, but in men the causes were physical
trauma, typically either injury to the head, neck or spinal column;
poisoning by industrial or artisanal use of lead, mercury, or silver;
or alcohol. Charcot's <I>fugueurs</I> had no history of physical
trauma, ergo, they were not hysterical. He confirmed that as fact by
clinical questioning, a practice which, we are today convinced, could
at his hands incite or remove symptoms of hysteria at the dictates of
theory. In addition to his clinical analysis, Charcot also claimed
that his men stopped travelling when given large doses of sodium
bromide, a specific for epilepsy, and largely worthless for hysteria.
He was in fact wrong about that: his classic patient wandered off,
never to be seen again, when stuffed full of bromide. Whatever the
merit of his arguments, he put in place a little paradigm: ambulatory
automatism is latent epilepsy.

<p>
According to <I>DSM-IV,</I> dissociative fugue by definition cannot be
frontal lobe epilepsy. <I>ICD-10</I> states more carefully that:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Differentiation from post-ictal fugue, seen particularly after
temporal lobe epilepsy, is usually clear because of the history of
epilepsy, the lack of stressful events or problems, and the less
purposeful and more fragmented activities and travel of the epileptic.
[<I>ICD-10</I>, 155]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Hence my claim that today's diagnosis of dissociative fugue is the
lineal descendant of ambulatory automatism looks suspect. Charcot,
after all, argued that ambulatory automatism is latent epilepsy (but
the travels of his own favorite patient were, 
contra <I>ICD-10,</I> thoroughly purposeful). However, there was
another, anti-Charcotian, little paradigm set up in Birdhouse the year
before Charcot invented the very phrase "ambulatory automatism." The
Birdhouse <I>fugueurs</I> had many of the florid symptoms of hysteria,
such as restricted fields of vision, partial anaesthesias,
inexplicable headaches, trance preceded by globus, and exceptional
suggestibility. Above all, although they usually could not remember
where they travelled, they could recall many specific details under
hypnosis. Hypnosis and hysteria had been firmly joined by Charcot
himself. The recovery of lost itineraries by hypnosis was standard and
striking. This proved--in the second little
paradigm--that fugue was a type of hysteria. <b></b> 

<p>
So two stories were in circulation about
<I>fugueurs</I>--they were epileptics, or they were
hysterics. Instances of both types of men were adduced by rival
parties. After Charcot died in 1893, all but his most faithful
acolytes climbed on the hysteria bandwagon. Sage opinion had it that
there were two types of fugue, but that most <I>fugueurs</I> could be
expected to be hysterical rather than epileptic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 That did
not last long. Fugue was found among an extraordinary range of mental
illnesses, and finally within that new German diagnosis, <I>dementia
praecox</I> itself. Fugue ceased to be a type of hysteria, or a type
of latent epilepsy, and became simply a symptom or manifestation of a
superordinate disorder.

<p>
That is a snippet from the French story. Fugue powerfully illustrates
the role of national tradition and spheres of influence. Whereas Italy
had its spate of mad 
travellers directly after the disorder erupted in France, there was no
such diagnosis in Germany until 1898, when a doctor declared that
German psychiatry was derelict in its duty: it reported no clinical
studies of ambulatory automatism. The golden age of this disorder
began in Germany, a decade after the French one. It stopped only with
the Great War. The same is true of Russia. The Germans and Russians
were faithful Charcotians: fugues were epileptic equivalents.
Italians, on the other hand, inclined to the hysteria opinion.

<p>
Why were German-speaking doctors Charcotian, holding
<I>Wandertrieb</I> to be epileptic in nature? That leads us to the
next point, the military. A number of military doctors all over Europe
were repelled by the swingeing punishments handed down for
conscript-deserters during peacetime. So the army and navy physicians
fastened 
on automatism as a way of getting men off. Male hysteria
never had the role in the German or Slavic speaking worlds that it had
in France and Italy. By 1905, when fugue really caught on in Central
Europe, hysteria was dying, for reasons so well described by Mark
Micale.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Hence latent epilepsy was the best hook on which
the military could hang <I>Wandertrieb.</I>

<p>
Incidentally, fugue never did catch on in the English-speaking world,
despite the fame of Ansel Bourne. Bourne was a born-again preacher who
was re-born as someone else, who was not a preacher but a grocer named
Brown, somewhere else.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 He was described as a multiple
personality, not as a <I>fugueur.</I> William James and other
spiritualists interviewed him. In his Lowell lectures in 1896, James
went so far as to take ambulatory automatism as the central idea of
dissociation, with multiple personality as
peripheral--precisely the opposite of what was done, then or
now, by every other theorist of dissociation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Charcot's
lecture on ambulatory automatism was widely reported in Britain and
America, and a few cases did attract brief attention, but aside from
William James it was seldom taken seriously.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 A few
instances of what would in France have been reported as classic
ambulatory automatism were described as multiples. Two phrases readily
explain why fugue was unimportant in America: No conscript army, and
"Go West, young man." Fugue requires, as the 1994 <I>DSM-IV</I> puts
it, a home or customary place of work, or, as my epigraph from 1891
said, it requires penates. But there is a third reason. Hysteria,
epilepsy, and hystero-epilepsy all fell under the sign of degeneracy,
an especially French obsession. <b></b> The portfolio of the nineteenth
century took stock in different ways at different times. At the
beginning of the century, suicide, madness, crime, and prostitution
were favored choices, for they helped to keep down the French birth
rate, relative to that of Germany or Britain. After 1870
vagrancy--<I>vagabondage</I>--began to enter, and
by 1885 it was deemed a major social problem. To exaggerate, it became
the "universal of mental pathology, the prism through which all the
categories of 
madness and abnormality could be distributed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Thus
vagrancy was straight away medicalized. Vagrants were degenerates,
sure enough. And many must suffer from <I>automatisme ambulatoire.</I>
Jean-Claude Beaune has gone so far as to describe the medicalization,
and medical incarceration, of tramps and hobos as a species of
"genocide."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The population was not literally killed, but
it was extinguished in asylums and jails.

<p>
Enter the police. In fact, Charcot's first and classic case of
ambulatory automatism had been subject to police harassment.He was a
delivery man for a company that manufactured brass ornaments. On his
first fugue, he was on a train crossing the Seine when the ticket
collector approached. Having no ticket, he jumped out of a window into
the river. He could not swim, but he was fished out and taken to a 
hospital. Within an hour he was reached by the long arm of the railway
police, demanding the fare. On his next fugue he got to the seaside,
and was there detained for some days. Because of these events Gilles
de la Tourette proposed that every person diagnosed with
<I>automatisme ambulatoire</I> should have a medical tag with clear
instructions about his disease and his home physician.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

That was the way in which innocent deviants could be fitted into the
growing system of surveillance of an increasingly mobile public.
Notice, incidentally, how Charcot's patient was, in terms of social
class, a prototypical <I>fugueur,</I> a hard-working delivery man,
who, in his fugue state, was so shocked to find that he was travelling
without a ticket that he risked drowning over dishonor.

<p>
Those were early days, when philanthropy and concern for the patient
were paramount in the minds of the physicians. At the end of the
ambulatory automatism 
period we find a very different political philosophy of fugue. It was
stated by the head doctor at the Paris Police Prefecture and an
alienist at a mental hospital who served regularly as an expert
witness in prosecutions: "Fugue," the two men insisted, "is an
anti-social act."

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Every individual has obligations under which he lives. From the moment
that he breaks the social contract, be it instinctively or
voluntarily, he puts himself outside legality. That is the case of the
<I>fugueur</I> who abandons his domicile, and that is why fugue is an
anti-social act.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Then they gave a brisk distinction of fugue from the problems that had
perplexed the clinicians. Fugue is to be distinguished from
"procursive epilepsy, automatic somnambulism, alcoholic and all other
displacements which <I>are not accompanied by the disappearance of the
subject."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In short, the police don't care about the
medical niceties. If the person stays at home or at work, fine, no
matter what ails him. But if <b></b> he flies for whatever reason or
cause, that's fugue, it is anti-social, and subject to detention and
punishment.

<p>
Our strange topic seems not to miss a single issue of the day. Our
decade is that of the Dreyfus case, but Jews were also deemed to be a
pressing problem at a much lower stratum of society. The great pogroms
in the East sent Jews all over Europe. Albert, the first Birdhouse
<I>fugueur</I> of 1887, had been casually compared to the Wandering
Jew. (He was not Jewish.) Charcot's students, working in a public
hospital, saw many poor Jewish refugees. Charcot and his assistants
were fascinated by what they called the iconography of the mad. They
were delighted to compare representations of the insane in medieval
art with photographs prepared in their clinic. One thesis from
Charcot's clinic is rich in copies of mostly seventeenth-century
woodcuts of the Wandering Jew. "The Wandering Jew of the old prints is
indeed a true wandering Jew, none other than the wandering Jew of the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<p>
A French medical thesis consisted of an opening discussion, some
general description, a number of cases presented in clinical detail,
and a conclusion. Here we find five detailed cases, four men and a
woman. Several of them have standard 
hysterical symptoms of partial anaesthesia and restricted vision. The
overall diagnosis is hystero-neurasthenia. (Beard's American
diagnosis, neurasthenia, has recently become prominent in the clinic.)
This being Charcot's clinic, these patients could not suffer from
ambulatory automatism, which was a species of epilepsy. There is an
odd twist here, because in the course of surveying the literature,
Charcot's student decides that the patient closest to the wandering
Jews is none other than Albert, the original <I>fugueur</I> of
Bordeaux. By implication Albert did not suffer from Charcotian
ambulatory automatism--while for Pitres, quoted in my
epigraph, the hysterical Albert was the very model of ambulatory
automatism. All of which reminds us, on the side, that you can't
retain ownership of the names that you invent.

<p>
The wandering Jews in Charcot's ward were duly photographed, although
the photographs were not reproduced in the thesis. Photography is an
essential modern art. The very first multiple personality in
history--that, is with more than two distinct and diagnosed
personalities--was photographed in some ten supposed
distinct 
personality states. Albert, the first <I>fugueur,</I> appeared only as
a drawing in a thesis about him. (Medical theses had only drawings,
not photos, which explains why the thesis on wandering Jews merely
refers to the photographs taken at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, but
includes many reproductions of old woodcuts.) For published
photographs of Albert we must turn to the textbook by
Pitres.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 There we see Albert as normal, as natural
somnambulist, as hypnotized, and as <I>fugueur.</I> Thus the very
first case of fugue was presented to the world with what was called an
iconography.

<p>
I should say a little more about the medical culture in which Albert
made his way. The first French double personality to be studied in
depth was F&eacute;lida X, known to hospitals in Bordeaux from 1858,
but presented as a double personality only in 1876.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Her
doctor was Eug&egrave;ne Azam. Philippe Tissi&eacute;, who wrote up
Albert, was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Azam's. For twenty years
Bordeaux, progenitor of double personality, also produced almost half
the roster of written-up cases of fugue, or ambulatory
automatism, <b></b> in France. The doctors there were true bourgeois.
Azam had a notable 
collection of paintings, objects from the ancient world, and local
archaeological 
discoveries. Azam and Tissi&eacute; knew each other best not as senior
and junior doctor, but because Tissi&eacute; was honorary secretary of
the Bordeaux archaeological society, over which Azam presided. It was
these thoroughly modern res, the small bourgeois collectors, who
gave us multiple personality and fugue.

<p>
It may seem a large jump to another modern instrument, the bicycle.
The bicycle has for too long been crushed between the steam locomotive
and the automobile in accounts of the modern world and its machinery.
In the 1890s the bicycle was the thoroughly modern middle-class
sporting instrument of choice. Tissi&eacute; was able to discover
<I>fugueurs</I> on bicycles. His <I>fugueurs</I> on foot often did
eighty kilometers a day; we have no endurance record for the bicycles.
But, just possibly because he was fascinated by these feats of
endurance, Tissi&eacute; made physical education, rather than
psychiatry, his forte. Not that he saw these as being distinct. He
devised a remarkable cure for severe hysteria, which involved riding
endlessly on a bicycle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 It worked.

<p>
Another great product of modernism is the Olympic Games. There was
once a real question, fought out in the 1890s, about the nature of
sport. There was the Swedish system, which opposed competition, and
favored individual development by gymnastics. Pierre de Coubertin
famously took the opposite view, that the English (and ancient Greek)
model of competitive sport should rule. Coubertin nearly lost.

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Tissi&eacute; was dead set against what he saw as the excesses of
competitive sport, the very elements of enthusiasm, liberty and
schoolboy association that Coubertin so vigorously endorsed. Their
rivalry grew, until, by the early '90s, they were implacable enemies,
and when Coubertin again pleaded for athletic games at a conference of
the French Association for the Advancement of Science at Caen, in
l894, Tissi&eacute; strenuously attacked him and carried the day. The
conference resolved "to encourage physical exercise, but to make war
on sports in school establishments."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Tissi&eacute;, as we all know, may have won the battle, but he lost
the war, terribly. He did, in a way, have the last, if forgotten,
word. Having trained as an alienist, he could name the mental illness
from which his opponents suffered. They were afflicted by
ludomania.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>


<p>
Middle-class travel, photography, the bicycle, and the Olympic Games
are parts of the ideas of the modern that have been too much neglected
in our concern with, for example, painting and the novel. But I had
better return to stories. Here is one about a man more prosperous than
your typical <I>fugueur.</I> Emile, a Paris lawyer aged thirty-three,
"presents all the manifest signs of hysteria." He was "almost
instantaneously hypnotizable"--he had only to be asked to
fixate on a point in space, or to hear a sharp sound (the clap of a
hand), and he would fall into hypnotic sleep. He even went into a
trance when he caught himself looking into a mirror in a caf&eacute;
by the Bourse. It was perhaps not too surprising that every once in a
while he lost his memory. "A new life, a new memory, a new me, begins.
He walks, takes the train, makes visits, buys things, gambles, etc."
Some of the events in Emile's second state were not <b></b> altogether
unrelated to events in his normal state. Thus he visited his
stepfather, with whom he had a t, before changing state on 23
September 1888. He returned to his normal state in the middle of
October. Meanwhile he had, for example, visited one of his uncles, a
bishop in Haute-Marne. There he had broken furniture, torn up books
and even manuscripts. He also incurred 500 Fr of "debts" during his
peregrinations, which led to a charge of swindling. Since no one knew
exactly where he was, he was tried and convicted in absentia. The
decision was reversed once medical 
evidence had been heard.

<p>
He did it again, and also stole a small sum of money, and was again
apprehended. Two well known expert witnesses made a favorable
deposition. The charge was dismissed. In the first incident the man
recalled, under hypnosis, that he had borrowed 500 Fr to gamble, and
he described in detail the games he had played and how he had lost.
The second incident furnished even more compelling evidence of the
power of hypnosis (and hence of the hysterical nature of the case).
Emile knew he had, before he lost consciousness in his normal state, a
wallet containing 226 Fr. It disappeared during his second state. He
had no idea where or how. Six months later, under hypnosis, he
recalled the hotel in which he had left it. Awakened, he was told to
write to that hotel, and next day he received the wallet in the mail.
Here we find what was to become the central criterion for hysterical
fugue: amnesia for or 
confused memory about the trip, which could be resolved under
hypnosis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>


<p>
This story was presented to the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences Morales
on 20 January 1890 as a case of ambulatory automatism in an hysteric.
It was thereby an anti-Charcotian case. Emile had been treated by an
eccentric Parisian alienist and 
magnetizer, Dr. J. B. Luys, but it was the highly respectable
professor of medicine and hygiene, Dr. Adrien Proust, who reported the
case. Henri Ellenberger, that exemplary and encyclopedic student of
the history of dissociation, recalls "idle talk in Madame Verdurin's
salon" about a double personality, and writes, "It is noteworthy that
this very story had been published by Marcel Proust's father, Adrien
Proust, as a significant psychopathological case."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 That
may be pushing things, because 
ambulatory automatism, the very point (and title) of Proust's report,
is not mentioned by Marcel Proust, and the disorder had, indeed,
disappeared in France by the time Marcel Proust published the story.
For the passage occurs in <I>Le Temps retrouv&eacute;,</I> in the
voice of Dr. Cottard, who, "with the delicacy which reveals the man of
distinction," is changing the course of conversation from a
disagreeable subject. He "relates in more philosophical terms than
most physicians can command" how the trauma of a fire changed Madame
Verdurin's footman into a new man, with new handwriting and an
intolerable character that led to his being dismissed. Then, as they
moved from the dining-room to the Venetian smoking room,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Cottard told us that he had witnessed actual doublings of the
personality, giving as example the case of one of his patients whom he
amiably offers to bring to see me, in whose case Cottard has merely to
touch his temples to usher him into a second life in <b></b> which he
remembers nothing of the other, so much so that, a very honest man in
this case, he had actually been arrested several times for thefts
committed in the other 
during which he had been nothing less than a disgraceful
scamp.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Is this the specific story of Emile, reported in 1890 by Adrien
Proust? Or is it more of an amalgam? No matter. Emile himself is not a
prototypical <I>fugueur</I> because he was of the middle classes, a
lawyer. And in his fugue he was dishonest, a swindler. The
prototypical <I>fugueur</I> was an honest craftsman, artisan, clerk,
or regularly employed laborer--or a conscript. He was not
your Paris lawyer, nor was he a tramp. In his fugue state he never
stole unless it was out of necessity, a piece of food or clothing.

<p>
Hence I may return to my opening remarks. The <I>fugueur</I> is a
distorting mirror of the classier stuff that we call modern, for the
modern is assuredly bourgeois, and when modern men and women traveled
compulsively, they hired Thomas Cook &amp; Son to make the
arrangements. After a fugue the prototypical <I>fugueur</I> does not
ask, am I far from home? He does not ask, where is where? When he
wakes up he knows where, and wants to go home to family, unless
compulsion strikes again and he moves on. We do not find this humble
man in the impeccably controlled Proust, who at most frames a man,
possibly Emile, in a conversation. The <I>fugueur</I> is more a re of popular culture. His descendant appears in trashy stories as the
man who wakes up in a strange town, with no idea how he got there, but
with a train ticket in his pocket. In television thrillers his
descendant is run together with amnesia, contrary to the intentions of
<I>ICD-10.</I> I should expect <I>fugueurs</I> to occur in the
ephemeral popular writing of the 1890s, but I do not know of any. I
should be grateful to any 
reader who can direct me to examples.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<p>
My first and favorite <I>fugueur,</I> Albert of Bordeaux, red not
in Proust but in a popular book, complete with illustrations. He was
well worth the tale. On his greatest trip he was arrested in Moscow as
a nihilist. (How right the police of Moscow were: what is a
<I>fugueur</I> but the ultimate unwitting nihilist?) After several
months of incarceration, he was released with some three hundred
others (the remainder of his 
fellow nihilists were executed or sent to Siberia). He and his gang,
mostly Gypsies, were force-marched to the Bosphorus. That is a story
to tell elsewhere. I should like to conclude not with Albert, the
first <I>fugueur,</I> but with another man, the last of the French mad
travellers.

<p>
The last <I>fugueur,</I> as I think of him, was a compulsive deserter;
the military doctor who examined him called him a <I>deserteur
voyageur.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 I take him to be my own 
mirror image, because his routes were ones of which I am deeply fond.
His first desertion was from the barracks at Perpignan. From there he
walked over the smuggler's trails between France and Spain, a network
of glorious rocky walks in the Alb&egrave;res, the foothills of the
Pyrenees. There on a flowery slope or on a windblown outcrop you may
still encounter a nervous man who was hoping not to be seen. Today he
is more likely to be a confused Moroccan making his way gingerly
through to France than a dazed French conscript heading for the safety
of Spain.

Between 1980 and 1994 there was an intense debate among American
psychiatrists who treat dissociative disorders, as to whether amnesia
should even count among the defining conditions of multiple
personality or fugue. It was first included, then excluded, and then
reinstated as a condition for multiple personality. Such parochial

a man considering whether to feign fugue as a way of absconding,
because the hero is (ambiguously) already in a trance state.

<p>
No genealogist of the complex and heterogeneous cultural field we have
come to call aesthetic modernism can fail to acknowledge its multiple
intersections with that other richly articulated field known as modern
psychology. In both cases, an unprecedented preoccupation with the
interior landscape of the subject, a no longer self-confident self
functioning with increased difficulty in the larger world outside its
threatened and vulnerable boundaries, led to voyages of scientific and
artistic discovery whose endpoints have yet been reached. Whether it
be the empiricist tradition of Ernst Mach, Franz Brentano and William
James recently foregrounded by Judith Ryan in <I>The Vanishing
Subject</I>,
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Jean-Martin Charcot's investigations of
hysteria inspirational for such modernist movements as Surrealism, or
Freudian psychoanalysis, whose importance for modernism is evident in
such accounts as Carl Schorske's <I>Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle
Vienna</I>,
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 the story of aesthetic innovation has seemed
impossible to narrate without reference to the no less radical
developments in psychology happening at virtually the same time. What
Ryan calls the "complex intertextuality"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 between modernism
and psychology has perhaps reached its zenith in Louis Sass's recent
<I>Madness and Modernism</I>, which boldly seeks to understand such
familiar aspects of the modernist temper as perspectivism,
dehumanization, alienation, ironic detachment, hyperreflexivity, and
spatialized form precisely by finding affinities with the workings of
the schizophrenic mind, which was itself first labeled in the 1890s
and quickly became, he tells us, "the quintessential form of madness
in our time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 <b></b> 

<p>
Cultural fields, however, not only intersect and parallel each other,
producing reinforcements, homologies, and elective affinities, but
also sometimes interact through repulsions and negations, achieving
their fragile definitions by means of abjecting the other. In the case
of modernism and psychology, I want to argue, such a process of
negative exclusion did, in fact, occur, a process which overlapped and
sometimes interfered with the more positive interaction that has been
explored by other scholars. In particular, I want to show that what
the philosophers of this period called "psychologism" and which many
sought mightily to banish from their search for truth also emerged as
a source of anxiety at certain key moments in the genesis of aesthetic
modernism as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 My evidence will come from both
literary and visual instances of this anxiety.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Although I
do not want to be understood as saying modernism was essentially a
repudiation of psychologism, let alone unrelated to developments in
the psychological sciences per se, no understanding of its emergence
can afford to ignore the haunting presence of this stigmatized "-ism"
as a specter that refused to be effortlessly exorcised.

<p>
The philosophical critique of psychologism can be traced at least as
far back as Kant's claim that: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
in logic we do not want to know how understanding is and thinks and
how it hitherto has proceeded in thinking, but how it ought to proceed
in thinking. Logic must teach us the correct use of the understanding,
i.e. that in which it is in agreement with itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
His transcendental deduction was thus explicitly distinguished between
the <I>questio facti</I> of the "physiological derivation" of a priori
ideas and the <I>questio juris</I> of their validity. The most
elaborate and influential development of the critique, however,
appeared after a period in which psychologism gained ground among
philosophers and the upstart discipline of experimental psychology had
emerged to challenge philosophy as the royal road to unlocking the
mysteries of the mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Although there were rumblings
throughout the nineteenth century, only at its end did psychologism
emerge as a primary target of a philosophical counterattack. In 1884,
Gottlob Frege published <I>The Foundations of Arithmetic</I>, which
vigorously criticized attempts by philosophers such as Friedrich
Beneke, Jakob Fries, John Stuart Mill, and Franz Brentano to reduce
the mind, in particular its logical function, to the
psyche.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 More radical psychologizers like Nietzsche were
beneath Frege's consideration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>


<p>
Husserl, although himself initially indebted to Brentano, was
putatively won over to Frege's position by a devastating review the
latter wrote of Husserl's early work <I>The Foundations of
Arithmetic</I> in 1894.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 By his <I>Logical
Investigations</I> of 1900, Husserl had come to see that the empirical
science of psychology with its inductive laws of association could not
provide a basis for a pure, deductive logic, which goes beyond mere
probabilistic knowledge. In the 1890s, other philosophers, such as the
neo-positivist Alexius Meinong and the neo-Kantians Rudolf Hermann
Lotze and Hermann Cohen, also vigorously turned against psychologism,
moving away from epistemological questions to logical and ontological
ones.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In physics as well, a challenge <b></b> to the radical
associationism of Ernst Mach and the "energeticism" of Wilhelm Ostwald
was launched by defenders of the reality of discrete atoms like Ludwig
Boltzmann.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 At the same time, sociologists like Emile
Durkheim and Max Weber sought to avoid reducing social facts to their
alleged psychological substratum, and historians like Wilhelm Dilthey
gave up their search for underlying psychological types in favor of
hermeneutics of objective meaning.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>


<p>
This is not the place to attempt a full-scale history of
anti-psychologism, a task admirably carried out by Martin Kusch in a
recent study in the sociology of knowledge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Suffice it to
say that shortly after Husserl's conversion, it became a fundamental
principle of many influential twentieth-century philosophers in
different camps, including such otherwise disparate res as
Heidegger, Cassirer, Russell, Moore, Carnap, Luk&aacute;cs, and
Goldmann.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Even the early Wittgenstein, as Cora Diamond
has recently shown, sought to banish psychology and follow the Kantian
dictum that logic was in agreement only with itself, however much he
may have ultimately come to question Frege's belief that logic might
be freed of ordinary language as well and expressed in a pure,
unequivocal "concept-script."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>


<p>
There were, of course, many variations in the alternatives to
psychologism provided by these critics, and indeed their target was
not always understood in precisely the same way, but the general
complaint was as follows.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Reducing the mind to the psyche
was problematic for logic and mathematics because it opened the door
to relativism in which truth was merely a function of the specific
thinking mind in which it appeared or of its cumulative experience
over time. Even the concepts of a species-wide transcendental
consciousness or innate biological capacities (of the kind later
defended by Noam Chomsky) were insufficient to ward off the threat of
psychological relativism. As Frege put it, "neither logic nor
mathematics has the task of investigating minds and contents of
consciousness owned by individual men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The philosophy of
mind, in other words, was not reducible to the philosophy of actual
human minds; the apodictic or a priori character of certain universal
truths was not the same as the empirical and a posteriori character of
contingent knowledge. "2 + 2 = 4" and the law of contradiction were
entirely independent of the minds that held them. The truth content of
propositions had to be rigorously separated from the judgments made
about them, judgments that would be better understood as correct or
incorrect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The sense of a proposition, to put it slightly
differently, had to be distinguished from its presentation or
representation; confirmation and refutation were not the same as
persuasion. Moreover, whereas psychological laws could never be more
than vague and probabilistic, based as they were on inductive
generalizations, the laws of logic and mathematics were valid,
timeless, and pure; the latter could not therefore be derived from the
former.

<p>
Husserl, to be sure, ultimately paid more attention than did Frege to
the links between disembodied, timeless Mind and the actual cognition
of real human beings; the ideal realm of logic and mathematics could,
after all, manifest itself in the finite, but rational, consciousness
of fallible mortals. If not, he reasoned, we could have no access to
it. There is thus a possibility of eidetic intuition, Husserl claimed,
which <b></b> provided the immediate evidence of essential
objects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Achieving such intuition was, in fact, the point
of his phenomenological rather than strictly logical method with its
continuing debt to Brentano's notion of intentionality. He thus
returned to a variant of the transcendentalism that Frege scorned.
Nonetheless, both he and Frege resisted the reduction of objective to
subjective ideas, understood either as generalizations from empirical
experience or the product of mere introspection into the individual
self.

<p>
They also shared a strong hostility to what they claimed was the
psychologistic confusion of cause and justification, the genetic
fallacy that understood validity in terms of origin. Whereas
psychologism was determined to reduce logic and mathematics to a prior
psychological disposition or the cumulative weight of successive
experiences, they wanted to disentangle one from the other. As Frege
admonished his readers,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
never let us take a description of the origin of an idea for a
definition, or an account of the mental and physical conditions on
which we become conscious of a proposition for a proof of it. A
proposition may be thought, and again it may be true; let us never
confuse these two things.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Logic and mathematics had timeless validity, which meant their origins
or causes were irrelevant to their intrinsic truth content.

<p>
How ultimately compelling these criticisms of psychologism may be
cannot be decided here. There are, in fact, still heated disputes
among philosophers, and defenses have been mounted by positing
alternative versions of psychology that allegedly escape its
pitfalls.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 What is important for our purposes is the
remarkable extent of its success in the very decades when aesthetic
modernism was itself emerging, from the 1890s through World War
I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Indeed, its power remained strong well into the era
after World War II. Its echo can, for example, still be clearly heard
in one of the most powerful theoretical defenses of modernism made in
the 1960s, Theodor W. Adorno's <I>Aesthetic Theory</I>. Speaking of
the psychoanalysis of works of art in particular, Adorno writes, "it
neglects to consider their real objectivity, their inner consistency,
their level of form, their critical impulses, their relation to
non-psychic reality and, last but not least, their truth
content."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>


<p>
For certain modernist artists as well, the threat to the integrity of
the work of art and its timeless truth value posed by psychologism was
also a palpable reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 There was a modernist "mystique
of purity," which, as Renato Poggioli noted many years ago, 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
aspires to abolish the discursive and syntactic element, to liberate
art from any connection with psychological and empirical reality, to
reduce every work to the intimate laws of its own expressive essence
or to the given absolutes of its own genre or means.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
A displaced variant of the time-honored struggle to maintain a
boundary between the sacred and the profane, this aspiration can also
be understood as yet another <b></b> instance of what sociologists have
seen as the uneven process of differentiating value spheres
characteristic of modernization as a whole. At certain times, the
dislocations produced by that process seem to have been especially
acute, resulting in a struggle over boundary maintenance or
reconration that was particularly fierce. The late nineteenth
century in Europe was by all accounts a period in which the cards,
cultural as well as social, were being rapidly shuffled in new and
threatening ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>


<p>
The threats that resulted in the generalization of anti-psychologism
beyond the confines of philosophy were multifarious: for example, the
expansion of confidence in natural science produced a scientistic
hubris that threatened the value of other approaches to reality; the
extension of new forms of popular commodified culture appealing to the
desires and fantasies of the masses menaced the allegedly
disinterested real of high art; and the challenge to traditional
gender roles in the fin-de-si&egrave;cle created anxieties about the
domination of masculine conceptions of cultural value. Modernism, as
Andreas Huyssen has shown, often defended itself against a feminized
version of mass culture, which it stigmatized as debased
kitsch.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Not surprisingly, one weapon in its battle with
these demons was the exorcism of psychologism in the name of a
universalism that would, however, be based on non-scientific values.

<p>
Perhaps the most explicit manifestation of the struggle against
psychologism appeared in the development of modernist literature in
Britain around the time of World War I. In virtually all accounts of
the evolution of British poetry from Yeats to Pound, Ford, and Eliot,
the search for something called "impersonality" and the suppression of
subjective expressivity has been duly recognized.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

Although the tangled web of attitudes towards subjective expression
and objective presentation in the history of British modernism has
prevented the story from being a straightforward narrative of
one-dimensional anti-psychologism, it is nonetheless clear that the
anxieties we have traced in Frege, Husserl, and the neo-Kantians were
given aesthetic voice in the work and theory of the major res in
that story.

<p>
In fact, the explicit importance of Husserl's critique of psychologism
for the poetry and criticism of the influential critic and poet T. E.
Hulme has been widely acknowledged. Although it took some time to
disentangle Hulme's initial enthusiasm for Bergson's philosophy of
flux and immediate experience from his later, very different
position--an entanglement abetted by the ensemble
publication of essays from his entire career in the collection
entitled <I>Speculations</I>, posthumously appearing in
1924--there seems to be a consensus now that he had shifted
his opinion in the years directly before the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Partly
due to the relentless critique of Bergsonism as hopelessly romantic
and simplistically democratic, made by Pierre Lasserre, Charles
Maurras, and other neoclassicist stalwarts of the right-wing Action
Fran&ccedil;aise, Hulme's change of heart also reflected a reading of
Husserl's attack on psychologism in the <I>Logical Investigations</I>,
which apparently allowed him to understand for the first time the
implications of the anti-idealist realism he had encountered in the
analytical philosophy of G. E. Moore and Bertrand
Russell.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Liberally citing the German philosopher in the
essay that opened <I>Speculations</I>, "Humanism <b></b> and the
Religious Attitude," a version of which had been already published in
1915, Hulme decried the entire trend of modern thought from the
Renaissance on as distressingly anthropomorphic, based on the mistaken
reduction of objective ideas to a merely human source, the confusion
of pure philosophy with <I>Weltanschauung</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 

<p>
But Hulme went beyond Frege and Husserl's critique of psychologism in
a crucial way: he applied their argument outside of the realm of logic
per se. Citing Moore's <I>Principa Ethica</I> of 1903, with its
celebrated critique of the naturalist fallacy, Hulme argued that
ethical values as well should be understood as irreducible to human
construction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 It was possible, he contended (without
bothering to demonstrate how), to arrange them in an objective
hierarchy. A parallel argument loosely derived from Wilhelm
Worringer's 1908 <I>Abstraction and Empathy</I> allowed Hulme to
denounce aesthetic styles based on intersubjective empathy (or more
precisely, on a subject's pantheistic empathy with a beautiful object
in the world) as inherently inferior to those, such as Egyptian or
Byzantine, which resisted naturalistic organicism in the name of
impersonal, geometrical, non-vitalist abstraction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Modern
art, exemplified by the sculpture of Jacob Epstein and the paintings
of C&eacute;zanne and Wyndham Lewis, Hulme argued, promised a return
to precision, austerity, and bareness, the anti-humanist values he so
admired.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 It would help clean up the mess produced by
transgressing boundaries, that "pot of treacle over the dinner table"
Hulme famously identified with the "spilt religion" that was
romanticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>


<p>
This is not the place and I am not the scholar to present a detailed
and nuanced account of the complicated resonances of Hulme's ideas
among the English modernists, especially the Imagist
poets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Nor can we pause to consider related developments
in the modernist novel from Flaubert to Virginia Woolf, in which
stylistic innovations like the <I>style indirect libre</I> helped
create the effect of non-egocentric impersonality in ways that
parallelled developments in the poetry of the modern era.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

And we cannot open up once again the debate about spatial form in
modern poetry and the novel launched by Joseph Frank, who acknowledged
an explicit debt to Hulme and Worringer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 What, however,
needs to be at least briefly underlined is the pivotal role of a
re of inestimable importance who acknowledged an explicit debt to
Hulme and through him to Frege and Husserl: T. S. Eliot.

<p>
In his new journal, <I>The Criterion</I>, and elsewhere, Eliot
energetically promulgated many of Hulme's ideas, aesthetic as well as
political. In such celebrated essays as "Tradition and the Individual
Talent" of 1919, he presented many of the same anti-psychologistic
arguments we have already encountered. "Poetry," he contended in lines
that quickly became canonical, "is not a turning loose of emotion but
an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality but an
escape from personality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 His influential notion of an
"objective correlative" seems likely, in fact, to have been taken
directly from Husserl, whom Eliot read when he studied philosophy at
Harvard in 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Although his obvious debt to the F. H.
Bradley on whom he wrote his dissertation has been widely
acknowledged, Eliot also drew on the work of Meinong, Russell, and
Moore and the other so-called "new realists" of the
period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 According to Sanford Schwartz, "in his thesis he
undermines the assumptions of the <b></b> psychologist by reducing
consciousness to its objects, and later used the same strategy in his
critique of nineteenth-century poetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Eliot, Schwartz
also shows, went on to criticize an equally abstract objectivism,
which reified objects as a simple inverse of the romantic reification
of the integral subject; he was clearly no naturalist seeing art as a
passive reflection of an external world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The poet's
ability to fashion words from his immediate experience somehow
overcame the very dichotomy between subject and object, challenging as
well the infamous "dissociation of sensibility" that Eliot claimed had
plagued the modern world ever since the English Revolution placed
feeling above wit. 

<p>
Through the dissemination of Eliot's ideas by the New Critics of the
1930s and 1940s, impersonality became a new dogma and the isolation of
the poem from its contexts of production and reception an article of
faith. Like the logic Frege had hoped to rescue from its
psychologistic reduction and the ethical imperatives Hulme had sought
to distinguish from the humans who followed or transgressed them,
aesthetic value, often equated entirely with formal
self-referentiality, became an end entirely in itself. The New
Critics's dreaded genetic and affective fallacies and the fallacy of
expressive form were all little more than redescriptions in poetic
terms of the warnings against psychologism made by late
nineteenth-century philosophy. Even when later champions of modernism
like Charles Altieri sought to reintroduce a notion of agency, they
were careful to distinguish the structuring activity of the artist
from the emotional interiority of the empirical, suffering subject
lurking beneath its surface.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<p>
All of this is by now well known and needs no belaboring. But what
perhaps warrants some attention is the parallel process that can be
discerned in the visual arts during this period. Not surprisingly, the
value of hard-edged visual distinctness, which Hulme and the Imagists
defended as a metaphoric antidote to the sloppy pantheistic
continuities they saw in romanticism, could easily be adopted in
literal terms by painters anxious to experiment with geometric
abstractions and fields of color.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Despite the powerful
subjectivist impulse in certain visual modernisms, most obviously
German Expressionism, others manifested the same suspicion of
psychological expression that we have noted in literary modernists
like Eliot. 

<p>
The nineteenth century, to be sure, can be said to have been, by and
large, a period of the increasing psychologization of the visual, the
abandonment of a geometric optics of representation based on the eye's
ability faithfully to mirror the world outside. The story of how,
beginning in the second decade of the nineteenth century, scientists
of perception undermined the classical observer modeled on the
automatic functioning of a camera obscura has been masterfully
reconstructed by Jonathan Crary in his recent <I>Techniques of the
Observer</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 No longer a monological, punctual,
mechanical eye coolly recording a world outside itself, the new
spectator was embodied, binocular, and influenced by internal
psycho-physiological processes such as afterimages, the presence of
sensations without any simultaneous external stimulus. The
psychologization of vision, the loss of confidence in the veracity of
the eye and such systems of representation as Renaissance perspective,
affected art history and <b></b> criticism as well as practice. Thus, in
his influential <I>Principles of Art History </I>of 1915, Heinrich
W&ouml;lfflin would write of the oscillating pattern of classical and
baroque styles he saw as a constant of visual representation: "There
is no denying it--the development of the process is
psychologically intelligible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>


<p>
The delayed artistic repercussions of the changes Crary details in the
early part of the century can be found most readily in the "glancing,"
embodied, and dynamic--as opposed to "gazing," disembodied,
static--eye of Impressionism, to borrow Norman Bryson's
well-known distinction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 It has thus been easy for
commentators on the literary offshoots of psychological empiricism,
such as Judith Ryan, to find compelling parallels between them and
Impressionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Both suggest a withdrawal from the world
of stable objects and a new preoccupation with the perceiving subject,
a subject in crisis, absorbed by its own dissolution, fascinated and
sometimes bewildered by the flux of sensations flooding in from
without.

<p>
It is, however, with the loose and amorphous body of work that has
become known as post-Impressionism, and with the painting of
C&eacute;zanne in particular, that these parallels begin to break
down. Indeed, it might be said that the famous "doubt" that
Merleau-Ponty detected in C&eacute;zanne was directed not only towards
the traditional perspectival order of the Renaissance frozen gaze, but
also towards the adequacy of the Impressionists' glancing
eye.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 His attempt to return to objects and paint "nature"
was not, however, a restoration of earlier representational realism;
instead, it sought the real entirely on the surface of the canvas,
where subject and object, perception and the perceived, were not yet
distinct and separate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Here a world of pure monstrance,
of visual presence rather than representation, began to supplant the
sensationalist psychologism of the Impressionists. Although
Merleau-Ponty thought C&eacute;zanne had anticipated what later
psychologists, such as the Gestaltists, were to realize in their
laboratories, his description of the painter's achievement suggests a
less psychologistic interpretation: "The lived object is not
rediscovered or constructed on the basis of the contributions of the
senses; rather it presents itself to us from the start as the center
from which these contributions radiate."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>


<p>
C&eacute;zanne's project to capture viewer and viewed together on the
flat surface of the canvas and thus realize unmediated visual presence
may have been utopian, but it provided a challenge to the psychologism
that had come to dominate nineteenth-century spectatorship (a
challenge, as Altieri has argued, that had an impact on modernist
poetry as well).
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Thierry de Duve describes that challenge
in terms of a difficult choice: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Modernity picked up C&eacute;zanne's heritage in the form of an
alternative: either I actively destroy the object, the re, and all
the realism that goes along with it, in order to preserve that which
remains of my subjective integrity--here I have no other
choice than to destroy the represented real, but at least
in destroying it I make myself master of it--or I agree to
sacrifice my subjective unity and allow the plural significance of my
self-image to appear, but to the benefit of an unalterable
pseudo-object, the self-sufficient epiphany of a world that excludes
me.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<b></b>

<p>
At different times, different movements and res opted for one or
the other of these alternatives (and some, to be sure, sought to
overcome them by somehow including a dispersed notion of subjectivity
in the epiphany itself).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 But it is perhaps legitimate to
say that in the long run most modernist painting, at least as it
became canonically described in the criticism of Roger Fry, Clive
Bell, Clement Greenberg, and Michael Fried, took the second course.
That is, it sought to purge painting of anything allegedly superfluous
to it, any expression of the painter's interiority, any
representational reference, decorative functionality, or theatrical
appeal to the beholder. Instead, painting came increasingly to be
understood as a quest to realize only the essential and immanent laws
of painting themselves, a quest for an authentic, truth-telling art
that would be ontologically "absolute." Even when that absolute was
understood in spiritual terms, as it was by Kandinsky, it meant the
extirpation of the psychological subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Very much in
the spirit of Kant's defense of logic as understanding "in agreement
with itself," high modernism became a game of purification and
reduction in which formal pictorial qualities were their own
ends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Indeed, for Greenberg, Kant himself was "the first
real Modernist" because he "used logic to establish the limits of
logic, and while he withdrew much from its old jurisdiction, logic was
left in all the more secure possession of what remained to
it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>


<p>
Not surprisingly, the aesthetic variant of this strategy of <I>reculer
pour mieux sauter</I>, most explicitly realized in the writing of
Greenberg after his break with Marxism, often earned a comparison with
the New Criticism that was the scholarly handmaiden of literary
modernism at this time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Greenberg's explicit embrace of
Eliot's banishment of personality from aesthetic judgment was also
remarked, as was the similarity between his position and that of
Adorno.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Although Eliot's later ruminations on culture and
tradition suggest a more hermeneutic, contextual perspective, both he
and Greenberg could be seen as championing self-reflexivity and
self-absorption, in which the aesthetic object is rigidly segregated
from anything outside its apparent boundaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>


<p>
The anti-psychologistic impulse in the Greenbergian version of high
modernism is thus not difficult to discern. More surprising is that
something similar can be detected in the work of a modernist re,
who fell entirely outside of the canon established by Greenberg and
the other champions of optical purity and self-sufficiency: Marcel
Duchamp. What has been called his "pictorial nominalism," which
perhaps became most explicit when Duchamp began fashioning his
celebrated "readymades," meant foregrounding the constitutive power of
the artist, who named an object an artwork through an act of
enunciation ultimately valorized by the institutions of art rather
than by his own genius or skill.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Eschewing the search for
optical purity, indeed truculently indifferent to any optical values,
and hostile to the search for the "absolute" essence of the medium of
painting, Duchamp was in many respects the antithesis of the artist
who hopes for the epiphanous revelation of a self-sufficient world on
the flat surface of his canvas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Instead, he promoted the
invasion of the realm of the visual by the textual and discursive,
allowed the real world literally <b></b> to appear through the surface of
the "canvas" (the <I>Large Glass</I> was a transparent "window"
mocking both the old metaphor of the canvas as window and the new
celebration of its two-dimensional opacity), and foregrounded the
persona of the artist, whose unstable identity registered the crisis
of the genius model of creativity.

<p>
And yet, despite his radical problematizing of the mainstream
modernist quest for pure visual presence and his deliberate mockery of
its ontological pretensions, Duchamp was, I want to argue, equally
suspicious of certain versions of psychologism in art. His famous
dismissal of "retinal painting" was aimed at the positing of the
painter's or beholder's eye, whether gazing or glancing, as the
foundation of aesthetic value. His nominalism extended, we might say,
to the perception of the artist, whose sensitively recorded act of
ephemeral seeing was no less a questionable standard of veracity than
the idealized representation of objects allegedly present in the
visual field of a disembodied, camera obscura gaze.

<p>
Duchamp was even more antagonistic to an aesthetic of expressivity,
arguing instead for an anti-romantic art of dehumanization. As Werner
Hofmann has noted, "his act of choice consciously opposed the
glorification of subjective creation and the principle which holds
that the lowly object is ennobled by artistic
'expression.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Not surprisingly, in the 1950s Duchamp
took to quoting T. S. Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent,"
with its famous distinction between the "man who suffers" and "the
mind who creates," and told one critic in 1961 that "Eliot's essay
presents his own feelings as well or better than he himself has ever
done in writing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 In short, even so maverick a re in
the pantheon of modernism as Marcel Duchamp felt obliged to distance
himself from the lure of psychologism.

<p>
Duchamp and Eliot, to be sure, are certainly an odd couple and can
only remain together in a tense constellation for a short while before
they begin to drift apart. Duchamp, in fact, has emerged in the past
few decades as the quintessential critic of modernist pretensions to
formalist purity, optical essentialism, and the integrity of the
medium. Although he may have called into question expressive notions
of genius and disparaged the empirical perception of the artist, his
own role in dismantling the Greenbergian consensus has been
increasingly written in heroic terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 So too the
personal, often erotic traces in his work have come to the fore, in
ways that invite the charge of a renewed psychologism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>


<p>
The postmodern appropriation of Duchamp, in fact, would not feel
offended by this charge, for one of the most explicit dividing lines
between modernism and its putative successor is precisely their
differing attitudes towards psychologism. Indeed, in one sense,
postmodernism can be said to be a "second psychologism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP> Its return seems to have 
been prepared by the widespread
recognition that the modernist project of ruthless purification had
reached a dead end, as there was little interesting left to write or
paint about once all contaminations were banished. The indifference to
human suffering that seemed too often to accompany the modernist
differentiation of value spheres also made many uneasy, as the extent
of the modernist entanglement with fascism became clearer. Similarly,
the modernist pretensions to disinterestedness have seemed
increasingly hollow in the face of multiculturalist <b></b> and feminist
critiques of its <I>soi-disant</I> universalism, as well as the
sociological claim that aesthetic value is really just another name
for "cultural capital."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 And finally, the threat of a
scientistic version of psychology seemed less pressing once the
literary and hermeneutic dimensions of psychoanalysis came to the
fore.

<p>
The recent return to some form of psychologism is, in fact, evident in
philosophy itself, where a reaction against the privileging of
self-identical logic has taken many forms, among them a new
sensitivity to the impact of the institutional context of the
discipline on its subject matter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 The neopragmatism of 
Richard Rorty is a salient example of a renewed distrust of the
fallacy that defenders of psychologism had once mockingly dubbed
"logicism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 In <I>Philosophy and the Mirror of
Nature</I>, he notes with satisfaction that,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
seventy years after Husserl's "Philosophy as Rigorous Science" and
Russell's "Logic as the Essence of Philosophy," we are back with the
same putative dangers which faced the authors of these manifestoes: if
philosophy becomes too naturalistic, hard-nosed 
positive disciplines will nudge it aside; if it becomes too
historicist, then intellectual history, literary criticism, and
similar soft spots in "the humanities" will swallow it
up.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Rorty's plea is to stop worrying in the face of these putative dangers
and accept the inevitable blurring of the lines between philosophy and
its scientific and historicist neighbors. Heeding his message, some of
his pragmatist followers have reread the modernist tradition itself in
the hope of resituating its res in the new context; one has gone
so far as to try to rescue even T. S. Eliot by turning him into a
closet pragmatist, who ultimately came to believe in the virtues of
historical tradition and practical wisdom over logical (or aesthetic)
truth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>


<p>
Deconstruction has likewise taken aim at Husserl's attempt to use
eidetic intuition to provide an avenue of entry into the timeless
world of logical truth. Derrida's <I>Speech and Phenomena</I> begins
with an attack on the confusions of a transcendental psychologism that
seeks to exclude precisely those intrusions from without that any
psychologism necessitates.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 Gleefully extolling the very
contamination and pollution that so troubled critics of psychologism,
celebrating the temporal deferral and traces of the past that the
fetish of spatial form in modernism hoped to keep at bay, restoring
modified respect for the representation and mimesis that modernist
self-reflexivity had banished, deconstruction transgresses many of the
same boundaries that nineteenth-century psychologism had also
violated.

<p>
Its effects on literary critical attitudes towards psychologism have
been evident. Although eschewing any strong notion of the expressive
subject and no less suspicious of humanist pieties than Hulme and
Eliot were, deconstruction has reversed the New Critics' disdain for
romanticism and reintroduced complicated notions of
intentionality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 One need only mention New Historicism,
reception aesthetics, the pervasive influence of Nietzsche, and the
proliferation of psychoanalytically informed approaches to reinforce
the same point: the taboo against psychologism now seems firmly laid
to rest among literary critics. Or more precisely, many have come to
feel at home in a gray area between the absolute alternatives of a
maximalist <b></b> psychologistic reductionism, in which all mental
activity and all cultural artifacts are merely an expression of
emotional states, and an anti-psychologistic purism, in which
everything of value must be protected against any pollution from
without.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>


<p>
Indeed, one of the reasons it may be meaningful to distinguish between
modernism and postmodernism, however volatile that distinction may be,
is the recent undermining of the taboo, which operated so powerfully
during the modernist era. As I hope is now evident, "psychologism,"
with all of its connotations of reductionism, contamination, and
relativism, became one of the main anxieties of that era, a veritable
"specter," as one recent commentator has called it, haunting the
modernist mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Postmodernists, in contrast, seem more
relaxed and untroubled by these dangers, having learned to live with
the ghosts of the past rather than trying to exorcise them. Although
they hold no brief for the notion of an integrated subject, whose
individual psychology can be the genesis of art, they feel comfortable
with a dispersed and decentered subjectivity whose impulses, desires,
fetishes, and fantasies disturb the smooth workings of any cultural
sublimation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>


<p>
But to give the screw one final turn, postmodernism may itself be
haunted by a specter of its own, which refuses to die: the ghost of
modernist anti-psychologism. Some contemporary philosophers of mind
still struggle, after all, to produce a transcendental account of
consciousness that will establish the autonomy of at least mathematics
and logic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 Certain ethical theorists continue to balk at
the "emotivist" reduction of moral imperatives to personal
preferences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 And what Adorno liked to call the "truth
content of art" stubbornly refuses to lose its fascination for those
unwilling to level all aesthetic distinctions and reduce all judgments
to matters of individual taste.

<p>
If Derrida is right in claiming that the specter of Marx still haunts
our apparently post-Marxist world, the same might well be the case for
the anti-psychologism that flourished during the heyday of
modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 As the continuing wars over multiculturalism
and the canon testify, it would be premature to believe that the
pressures that produced the fear of psychologism have entirely
subsided, or that the search for aesthetic value is entirely a thing
of the past. Whatever the future of the debate, one thing is clear: it
would be a serious mistake to ignore the creative energies unleashed
by the effort to fend off psychologism during the previous era. For
even if it now seems a losing battle, or its outcome at best a
stalemate, the struggle was an indisputable ingredient in the making
of that remarkable phenomenon we call modern art.

The most recent and complete account of the debate over
"psychologism" can be found in Martin Kusch, <I>Psychologism: A Case
Study of the Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge</I> (New York:
Routledge, 1995). He notes that the term itself was coined by Johann
Eduard Erdmann in his <I>Grundrisse der Geschiche der Philosophie</I>
(Berlin: W. Hertz, 1866). A Hegelian, Erdmann introduced the term to
describe the work of Friedrich Eduard Beneke, but did not actively
criticize it (Kusch, <I>Psychologism</I>, 101).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT6" HREF="#REF6">6</a>.
It would also be possible to make a case based on musical examples,
beginning with Eduard Hanslick's defense of "absolute music,"
continuing through the post-Wagnerian rejection of romanticism, and
culminating in Schoenberg's twelve-tone row. If Ortega y Gasset is
right in his well-known analysis of the modernism "dehumanization of
art," the pivotal re was Debussy. For a recent discussion of
anti-psychologistic impulses in Stravinsky, see Richard Taruskin, "A

Although Durkheim's sociology, echoing that of Auguste Comte, was
more resolutely hostile to methodological individualism than Weber's,
even the latter insisted that a proper sociological explanation of
behavior was irreducible to psychological states of mind. Dilthey's
attitude towards psychologism was intensified by his reading of
Husserl's <I>Philosophical Investigations</I>, but he showed signs of
skepticism as early as 1860. See the discussion in Michael Ermarth,

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT15" HREF="#REF15">15</a>.
Kusch, in <I>Psychologism</I>, shows how loose and amorphous the
debate was, with almost every re on both sides of the fence,
including Husserl himself, being accused of some variety of
psychologism. He situates the debate in the context of the
institutional challenge to philosophy presented by the rise of
experimental psychology, exemplified by Wilhelm Wundt, Hermann
Ebbinghaus, Georg Elias M&uuml;ller, and Carl Stumpf, in the 1880s.

the first to underline in his "Husserl's Notion of Noema,"<I> Journal
of Philosophy</I> 66 (16 October 1969): 680-87, that both the
analytical and phenomenological traditions shared a common root in
anti-psychologism (although Frege was more important for the
analytical tradition and Husserl for the continental). Here the
celebrated gap between Anglo-American and continental philosophy
yawned far less widely than is normally assumed. This is not to deny,
of course, that some later philosophers in these traditions reopened
the question of the links between psychology and philosophy, e.g.
Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose debts to Gestalt psychology are evident.

Lucien Goldmann, to take one example, was hostile to psychologism
only when it meant the individual, libidinal psyche. But he supported
the idea of a collective, cognitive psyche and derided neo-Kantians
for their attempt to deny any human origins to the objects of
knowledge. See his <I>Immanuel Kant</I>, trans. Robert Black (London:
NLB, 1971), 153-56. In general, Marxist critics of psychologism
refused the absolutizing of logic evident in Frege, the neo-Kantians,
and Husserl, which they saw as the acceptance of reification. Their
anti-psychologism only meant a resistance to understanding the subject
of knowledge in psychological rather than trans-individual, social
terms.

Kusch argues that the war itself, at least in Germany, produced a
general intellectual consensus that stilled the battle over
psychologism, leaving phenomenology the winner. The war also provided
a new role for experimental psychology as an applied discipline, which
took its practitioners away from philosophical disputes. Those who
remained in philosophy departments in a general atmosphere that was
anti-scientific and anti-atomistic made their peace with the reigning
orthodoxy. See Kusch, <I>Psychologism</I>, chapter eight.

denial of any interest, any desire in allegedly autotelic works of
art. "In contrast of the Kantian or Freudian views on the matter," he
argues, "works of art necessarily evolve in a dialectic of interests
and disinterestedness" (<I>Aesthetic Theory</I>, 17). Earlier, Adorno
provided an equally dialectical treatment of Husserl's one-sided
anti-psychologism. See Theodor Adorno, <I>Against Epistemology: A

Peter B&uuml;rger's controversial distinction between modernism

Michael Shaw (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984), is
useful in this context. Those artists who most feared psychologistic
pollution conform to his definition of modernist, whereas those who
were less anxious, for example the Surrealists, were members of the
avant-garde that sought to reconcile life and art.

Sovereignty of the Artist 1885-1925</I> (New York: Atheneum,

ultimately means that "authority of style was based not on the
assimilation of other styles but on the expression of honest feeling
which is then transformed into individuality of style" (<I>Modern and
Modernism</I>, 153). Such an argument underestimates the modernist
desire to purify the work of psychological and emotional residues.

psychology during this period, such as Nietzsche's and Freud's, and
modernist elitism, but he neglects the opposite connection, which ties
anti-psychologism with misogyny. By isolating works from the contexts
of their production and reception, anti-psychologism furthered the
fiction that they were timeless, universal creations undisturbed by
issues of gender.

<p>
Aesthetic empathy, it should be noted, had been most extensively
defended by the German philosopher Theodor Lipps. As Levenson notes, 

<p><blockquote><!--_extract-->
Lipps also appeared in Husserl's <I>Logical Investigations</I>, where
he is criticized as a proponent of psychologism. Indeed, Worringer's
argument against Lipps and on behalf of abstraction bears notable
similarities of Husserl's defense of 'pure logic,' and although I know
of no evidence of any contact or influence, the theories of the two
res meet in Hulme's enthusiastic embrace. [<I>A Genealogy of

transring life as well.

169f. Noting Greenberg's Jewish anxiety about assimilation, he
compares it with Eliot's Anglo-Catholicism, and concludes that 

<p><blockquote><!--_extract-->
Greenberg's similar insistence on the aesthetic "extinction of
personality," and his 
determination to purge from art all traces of mundane existence, for
which kitsch became the shorthand term, reflect not so much a
political or even art-historical perspective, as they do a
fundamentally religious one. Located against the backdrop of Jewish
emigration from the shtetl and the ghetto, the opposition of purity
and impurity stands as a metaphor for the perilous choices imposed by
cultural assimilation in the New World. [Storr, "Greenberg's
Modernism," 175].

<p>
Situated in the context of the anti-psychologistic tradition as a
whole, however, Greenberg's values seem less quirkily reflective of
his own personal predicament.

See, for example, Rosalind E. Krauss, <I>The Optical
Unconscious</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1993), chapter three, in
which Duchamp is presented as introducing carnal desire rather than
cerebral reflexivity into his art. She explicitly contrasts his work
to the ascetic, contemplative aesthetics of Bloomsbury theorists such
as Robert Fry, which she claims was derived from G. E. Moore's
anti-psychologistic ethics. A very different account, which
nonetheless also stresses the psychological sources of his work, can
be found in Jerrold Seigel, <I>The Private Worlds of Marcel
Duchamp</I> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995).
According to Seigel, "behind Duchamp's claim to have devoted his
career to destabilizing his personality, countering the pull of taste
and habit with an aesthetic of indifference and avoiding the trap of
fixed identity by his various stages of self-contradiction, there
lurked an uncompromising exaltation of the self" (<I>The Private
Worlds of Marcel Duchamp</I>, 206). This self, however, was less a
sovereign maker than a chooser, who worked with the "givens" provided
by chance or the debris of the culture around him.

chapter eight. In an earlier essay, "Remembering Hulme: A Neglected

re who has been taken as the quintessential anti-psychologist. His
evidence, however, is basically limited to one aphorism in the
unfinished collection entitled <I>Cinders</I>, which Herbert Read
included in <I>Speculations</I>, which begins "The truth is that there
are no ultimate principles, upon which the whole of knowledge can be
built once and for ever as upon a rock . . . " (Hulme,
<I>Speculations</I>, 233-34). On this basis, Shusterman claims
Hulme was close to Rorty in his anti-foundationalist stress on the
priority of <I>Weltanschauungen</I> to absolute truth. Putting aside
the performative contradiction entailed in a sentence against absolute
truth that begins "the truth is . . . , " Hulme, it seems to me, was
attacking the humanist pretension to combine cognitive, ethical, and
religious knowledge in one grand system, not the possibility of
foundations in separate spheres. His appeal for strict discontinuity
between those spheres and belief in the authority of revealed religion
in value questions makes him a far cry from Rorty's philosophy of
relativist edification.

Hysteria was surely the most prominent and memorable <I>maladie de la
m&eacute;moire</I> of the nineteenth century: it served as an
intersection for many points of cultural contestation, becoming a
marker for positions on issues of gender, sex, mind/body,
professionalization and secularization, to name only a few. And
hysteria has remained a privileged site for discussing these issues in
critical and historical writing over at least the last twenty-five
years. Just as the conceptualization of memory and forgetting were at
the core of writings on hysteria in the late nineteenth century, so
recent writings continue to debate the ways we are to remember
hysteria, those who supposedly suffered from it, and those who
supposedly tried to understand or alleviate that suffering. The focus
on maladies of memory forced nineteenth century physicians to consider
what it meant  to have a healthy memory, and a normal relation
to the past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 What does it mean to suffer from the past, to
be pained by memory? How is it that some people manage not to suffer
from the past, to orient themselves properly in relation to the loss
of the present? How does attention to the past develop from being a
choice, a matter of taste, to being a duty, a matter of obligation, to
being an obsession, a matter of mental illness? These questions remain
crucial for us in our own fin-de-si&egrave;cle, with memory disorders
continuing to be a a major vehicle for their discussion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>


<P>
The fascination with hysteria and the investigation of it have, of
course, a very long history, about which there is now an enormous and
high quality body of critical writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 I focus on the
moment of this history when the study of hysteria comes together with
the study of hypnosis, both tied to a concern with the question of how
one recalls and manages to live with the past. Hypnosis becomes an
important subject of medical investigation in France after
Eug&egrave;ne Azam brings the famous case of F&eacute;lida X's
<I>d&eacute;doublement</I> (doubling of the personality, or the early
form of what is now called multiple personality) to the attention of
Paul Broca and the Academy of Sciences in 1859.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Hypnosis
was a technique that seemed to show that radical disturbances of
memory could be created in normal people, that our faculty of memory
could be manipulated in ways that deeply compromised its function as
the core of personal identity. Hypnosis and hysteria work together to
create a crisis in thinking about memory and normality. Who is
vulnerable to hypnotic suggestion and why? Who can claim expertise
about such matters, when hypnosis in various forms had been part of
popular culture long before the birth of psychology? The neurologist
Jean-Martin Charcot linked hypnosis to his investigations of
psychopathology, ultimately concluding that hypnosis was a form of
hysteria. And Charcot's authority in regard to hysteria was second to
none. But other investigators inside and outside the medical
profession claimed that we were all more or less susceptible to
hypnotic suggestion. They did not mean to imply that we were all
vulnerable hysterics, but they left it unclear how we discriminated
among these phenomena and among the classes of people with whom they
should be associated. In the 1880s, the alienist Legrand de Saulle
claimed that there were fifty thousand hysterics in Paris, ten
thousand having attacks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Did that not mean that there were
forty thousand invisible hysterics in the city, radically disturbed
people without the major symptoms of the disturbance? How, in this
case, to tell the normal from the abnormal? 

<P>
The effort to define normality and to set firm limits to health was of
great importance in late-nineteenth-century France, a period
in which the Third Republic was establishing itself as a secular
polity of reason, of enlightenment. The new order should have the
capacity to define the abnormal, to explain what had been regarded as
mysterious or had remained within the realm of religion and magic. The
famously deceptive disease of hysteria posed a great challenge to this
regime, and the investigation of equally puzzling hypnotic phenomena
led even the most scientific observers into areas where they were no
longer at home. Doctors knew that hypnosis allowed individuals to have
access to different sets of memories, or to forget (to not
experience?) painful events. In medical amphitheaters they showed
colleagues <b></b> women under a hypnotic trance with no reactions to or
memory of the needles stuck in their arms. But in other showplaces,
there were demonstrations that were more difficult to integrate into
the domain of science. Spiritists and mediums claimed that hypnotic
trances gave them access to different temporal dimensions, that they
could in fact speak with the dead. Conventional memory, they claimed,
could be supplemented through hypnosis with a cosmic memory.
Psychologists, psychiatrists, and neurologists joined hands with the
mediums and tried to ascertain whether they were on the road to a
revolutionary discovery about the nature of time and memory, or
whether they were dupes. Often they arrived in s&eacute;ances with the
latest photographic equipment so as to capture ephemeral events in a
permanent form. Photography, they thought, was the perfect vehicle for
remembering the <I>materialization</I> of the spiritual/mental: in
medicine and spiritism. Was photography also the proper model for an
ideal connection to the past?

<P>
In late-nineteenth century France, hypnosis was a bridge between the
normal and the abnormal. Hysterics lived on the bridge and were
represented as either revealing to us the otherness of serious illness
or the true possibilities that lay hidden 
 within ourselves. Some writers on hypnosis attempted to normalize it
as a transition between states that could be described (if not yet
fully explained) in the language of science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 For them,
hypnosis was very much like sleep, and hypnotic phenomena like dreams.
The spiritists pulled in the opposite direction, pointing to hypnosis
as the link to a realm that could not be accounted for in materialist
terms. Thus, for diverse writers concerned with these sorts of issues,
there was much at stake in the link between hysteria and hypnosis, and
in the question of whether everyone was 
vulnerable to hypnotic suggestion. Does our faculty of memory contain
within it the secrets that allow us to escape from the confines of
conventional corporeal (and 
temporal) existence? Or is our faculty of memory so vulnerable to
suggestion that it reveals the fragility of personal identity? Who has
the capacity to cross into and return from the abnormal; who has the
authority to claim to understand this crossing; and how can they
represent what they have found there to the rest of us?

<P>
In order for hysteria to become conceptualized as a disorder of
memory, the disease had to be separated from its traditional
gynecological aetiology, a task for which Pierre Briquet's
<I>Trait&eacute; clinique et th&eacute;rapeutique de
l'hyst&eacute;rie</I>  was a decisive intellectual
step.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Briquet's treatise assumes importance in large part
because it can be viewed retrospectively as leading toward Charcot's
elevation of hysteria in the 1870s and 1880s to the center of French
cultural life. Charcot established a clinical inventory of the
disease, reducing its florid variety of symptoms to an orderly series
of stages. Although he was convinced that degenerate heredity played a
crucial role in the neurological predisposition to the disease,
Charcot paid increasing attention to the psychological aspects of the
illness throughout his career.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 

<P>
It is crucial to see that in much of the medical writing on hysteria
at the end of the nineteenth century the disease was seen as a radical
dysfunction of memory. The link between memory and hysteria was the
concept of trauma. The term "trauma" <b></b> had been used regularly in
Western medicine to refer to a bodily wound. Charcot developed the
category of traumatic hysteria to understand those instances of the
disease (especially among men) that could be traced to some "shock" to
the nervous system. As Mark Micale has pointed out, Charcot's writing
in this regard was part of a general European and American concern
with the diverse long-term effects of injuries to the head and
spine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In the 1880s and 1890s in Britain and France these
injuries were frequently linked to railway accidents, and the term
"railway spine" designated an array of post-traumatic pathological
effects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 But this approach did not result in finding hard
anatomical evidence of a wound. To what, then, was the nervous system
reacting, when it began to malfunction some time after the original
accident (or shock) had taken place? How to understand a wound that
refused to heal yet remained invisible?

<P>
For Charcot the many lawsuits brought against railway lines by
passengers and workers who claimed to have suffered from some
traumatic shock as a result of train travel were often based merely
"on hysteria and only hysteria."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 In saying this, Charcot
was partly noting the hereditary antecedents of those who suffered
from railway spine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 But he was also underscoring the
disjunction between the pathogenic event (a train accident, a t, a
brush with danger) and the onset of symptoms, a disjunction both
temporal and causal. Symptoms might not begin immediately after the
original shock, and the symptoms that did arise could often not be
reconnected to the original event through some plausible causal chain.
The troubles of the young male hysteric might be linked in his mind to
the time when he was frightened by a falling object, but it was
impossible for the physician to discover how the trauma produced a
wound which led to a wide range of hysterical symptoms.

<P>
The memory of some occurrence, and not the original experience itself
was seen as the pathogenic factor, and often at the center of the
constellation of hysterical symptoms was an event that disrupted
subsequent memory. The strange case of Mme. D.'s hysterical amnesia
was discussed by Charcot, Janet, and other physicians of the
1880s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Mme. D., thirty-four years old and the wife of an
honest workman, was calmly sitting at her sewing machine in the small
city of M., when she was told by a man she did not recognize: "Prepare
a bed, we are bringing you your husband who is dead." She did not move
but began to cry. The strange man told her to stop crying and to
prepare the bed. Then, he left as suddenly as he had come. After the
neighbors heard her cries, they returned with her husband, who was in
good health and knew nothing of this. Upon seeing him, Mme. D. fell
into convulsions. She cried out for her husband, and seemed to have
hallucinations. 

<P>
After this attack, Mme. D. awoke without any memory of what had
transpired. Indeed, she had lost all memories dating back to the
previous 14 July, about six weeks prior to the false report of her
husband's death. Moreover, and this is what attracted the interest of
writers at the time, she seemed incapable of having any new memories.
The trauma, when combined with a predisposition to hysteria, led to
hysterical "retro-anterograde" amnesia. Charcot used the word
"elaboration" to describe the process through which an idea or
remembered event acquired hysterical potency <b></b> over time. Through
elaboration or auto-suggestion the trauma accumulated force and became
the root of the hysterical symptoms. Like hypnotic suggestion,
elaboration was a process that took place in the brain, but not one
that involved any 
conscious awareness. In the case of Mme. D., the shock of hearing of
her husband's death and then seeing him continued to block her
capacity to remember (and thus to experience) any new
events.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>


<P>
The concept of elaboration depended on a new and complex notion of
the brain and of memory, one presupposing that an original event is
remembered by the subject in ways that are independent of
consciousness. The subject, or perhaps we can say "part of the
subject," registers the event neurologically, storing its
representation in the brain. The stored event continues to have
effects on the workings of the 
nervous system, even if the event itself can not be recalled
consciously by the subject. This process, of course, is very familiar
to us, but in the late nineteenth century the idea of memories having
effects independently of consciousness was new and disturbing.
Curiously, Charcot paid almost no attention to the significance of the
stored event. The initial experience was treated like an electrical
charge that continued to have consequences on the nervous system, not
as an event that was 
cognitively or emotionally unbearable for the conscious subject. The
shock of this experience could even divide the faculty of memory or
"double" it. A doubled 
memory led to split personality, faculties of memory working in
isolation from one another--the same phenomena that Azam saw in
F&eacute;lida X, a case that also fascinated Charcot because it put
memory at the center of hysteria and split personality.

<P>
But Charcot did not pursue an investigation of doubling as a separate
pathological entity. He saw the phenomenon under what he imagined as
controlled conditions in hypnosis. Under hypnotism, subjects are given
access to a set of memories different from those that they would
recall in their normal personalities. This access can often be
remembered, with the proper hypnotic suggestion, so as to integrate
the different faculties of memory. In other words, once a forgotten
event is remembered under hypnosis, it can often be opened to the
normal faculties of recollection. Alternatively, that which happens
during the hypnotic trance can, through suggestion, be closed off from
remembrance in the normal state. "You will remember nothing of what
has happened here after I awaken you."

<P>
These techniques were long familiar to mesmerists and more mainstream
scientific investigators by the time Charcot announced his serious
interest in hypnosis in 1882.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 But when Charcot lent his
prestige to the study of hypnosis and related states, it seemed to
make new phenomena visible and old explanations suddenly worth 
 taking seriously. Charcot took a narrow view of his subject, one that
legitimated his own expertise. There was nothing mysterious about the
phenomena, no invisible fluids or forces from the beyond. Hypnotism
was a series of several "nervous states," which, like the stages of
hysteria, could be isolated and described in detail. As Anne
Harrington notes, "Charcot manages, in one fell swoop, both to give an
aura of medical respectability to a formerly shunned and suspect
subject, and simultaneously to stake a clear claim to the medical
profession's exclusive competency to deal with this
 <b></b> subject."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 For him, hypnotism was an artificially
created hysteria, and thus could be used to investigate cases of the
spontaneously generated disease. One of the ways the master did this
was by hypnotizing female hysterics and suggesting to them that they
mimic the symptoms of male hysterics. His best patients performed
splendidly.

<P>
In the case of Mme. D., hypnosis proved very valuable indeed. First,
it allowed Charcot to determine that the woman was indeed registering
her experiences, even though she could not recall them. "This woman,"
the doctor wrote, "whom we have been able to hypnotize, rediscovers in
her hypnotic sleep the memory of all the facts that have transpired
until the present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Hypnosis thus revealed a "second
self" which did not suffer the effects of the trauma that afflicted
her conscious self. The traumatic idea, the false report of her
husband's death, had acted as a form of 
suggestion, cutting off a faculty of memory as did hypnotic sleep. For
Charcot, the nervous system of the traumatized subject functioned much
like the nervous system of the hypnotized subject. They were
hysterical. The task for Charcot in the case of Mme. D. was to use
hypnotism to overcome the disjunction between the first and second
selves. Hypnosis functioned both as the sign of the pathology and the
possibility of curing it. If the patient was willing to follow the
hypnotic suggestion to remember, then the wound of the trauma could be
healed. 

<P>
But remembering for Charcot did not have any of the connotations of
integrating the self or facing one's desires that it would come to
have in the twentieth century. Remembering was a behavior that Charcot
wanted to promote, a behavior currently inhibited by a (probably
degenerate) nervous system that had not recovered from a shock (a
trauma) it had received. Marcel Gauchet has emphasized Charcot's
indebtedness to the neurophysiologists who by 1870 had established
that "the totality of the nervous system can and should be analyzed in
terms of unities similar in structure and function; that is to say, in
terms of sensori-motor connections and reflex processes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

The reflexive reactions of a degenerate nervous system following a
trauma leave it vulnerable to suggestion--that is one of the key
reasons for the production of symptoms. Suggestion can also be used to
get the system back on track.

<P>
It is instructive here to examine how Pierre Janet made sense of this
same case. Janet had a very different intellectual itinerary than
Charcot, although their interests crossed over the field of hysteria
and hypnotism. Whereas the latter came to this area from roots in
neurology and clinical diagnosis, the former's intellectual formation
began in philosophy, and he wrote his doctoral dissertation on
psychological automatism on the basis of his experiments with
hysterics in Le Havre.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Pursuing a 
second degree in medicine, he was invited by Charcot to direct a
laboratory of psychological research at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
in 1889, where he especially studied the operations of memory in
hysteria and hypnotism. For Janet, abnormal memory was at the core of
hysteria: "I am convinced that amnesia is very important in hysteria,"
he wrote, "and that it is even one of the cardinal symptoms of this
affliction . . . the principal fact which affects more or less all the
others, [is] disturbance of memory."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Hysterics often
seemed to live without past or future. Their amnesia, however, stemmed
from their inability to connect to the memories that they did in fact
have. <b></b> The hysterics remembered, but they did not know that they
remembered. The 
investigator could determine this through hypnosis.

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
An amnesia of a hysterical nature . . . is not due to the destruction
itself of traces left by sensations. In other words, in all hysterical
amnesias the conservation of memories still continues . . . this
forgetting is only an appearance, an illusion; it suffices to put her
to sleep again, through suggestion, or better still through an
automatic habit, to put her into a moral state analogous to that from
which she has just emerged in order for her to rediscover her
memories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
Doctors first became aware that Mme. D. was conserving traces of
events when she referred to them while talking in her sleep, crying
out about the dog that had bitten her in the street.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

While awake, she had no conscious recollection of the dog or her
cauterization treatment for rabies (with Dr. Pasteur!). As noted
above, when hypnotized Mme. D. did show that she recalled all the
events since the practical joke. Janet also showed that Mme. D. could
retain hypnotic suggestions and carry them out after she had been
awakened from her somnambulistic state. There was memory in Mme. D.
But where was it, and why was she unable to access it?

<P>
This last question is not one that seemed to interest Charcot. He
wrote about the patient on the level of the nervous system, not on the
level of consciousness. For Janet, on the other hand, Mme. D.'s
dilemma was further evidence of unconscious or subconscious
memory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Psychologists (Janet was probably thinking
especially of Ribot) had written extensively on two facets of memory:
the conservation of memories and the reproduction of images. The third
ingredient that Janet underlined was the <I>"perception personnelle
des souvenirs"</I> (the personal perception of memories) or the
<I>"assimilation des images" </I>(the assimilation of the [stored]
images).

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
It is necessary that the personal perception seizes this image and
reattaches it to the other memories, to sensations either clear or
confused, exterior or interior, the totality of which constitutes our
personality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
One can see Janet here as translating Charcot's neurological holism
back into psychological terms. One of the major accomplishments of
neurophysiology in the late 
nineteenth century was to use neurological response mechanisms to
provide an explanation of human behavior without a dependence on the
murky area of 
consciousness. These mechanisms operated independently of
consciousness. Janet was, of course, well aware of these processes,
having cut his intellectual teeth on the philosophical problem of
automatic actions. At least in regard to memory, however, he made
their independence of consciousness an aspect of their abnormality as
memory. Thus, in the case of Mme. D. her amnesia resulted from her
inability to attach the registration of experience to the other
memories which constituted her personality.

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
It is as if these patients had become incapable of having a personal
perception of their memories, of assimilating to their present
personalities the images which continue to <b></b> be conserved and
automatically reproduced in their minds; as if their personalities, 
definitively blocked at a certain point, can no longer grow through
the addition, the assimilation of new elements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
The lack of a "personal perception of one's memories" not only
restricts one's personality, it is linked with one's openness to
imitate the personalities of others or to follow their hypnotic
suggestions. Janet confronted the difficulty of using this tendency to
imitation, to accept suggestions, as a weapon against the
disintegrated self. Patients could be led to imitate an integrated
personality. But did this make them well or merely continue (even
deepen) the illness?

<P>
Janet's concern with the powers and dangers of hysterical imitation
are particularly evident in his discussion of his treatment of
Marceline.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Marceline entered the hospital in 1887 and was
in a severely anoretic state. Refusing almost all food and water,
unable to urinate, with severe visual and auditory impairments, and
insensible across the surface of her body, she seemed only to have
left a "last breath of life." Janet was alerted to the case by his
brother Jules, and they attempted to hypnotize the patient in the hope
of getting some food into her. 

<P>
Marceline was easily hypnotizable, and the brothers were shocked by
the "singular state" which the hypnotic trance brought on. She ate and
drank without difficulty, was able to urinate on her own, and showed
sensibility and unimpaired hearing and sight. The vivacity of the
hypnotized Marceline was striking, but since the Janets regarded this
state as "artificial," they felt obliged to "awaken" her. As soon as
the hypnotic state was lifted, Marceline fell back into her prior
condition, although she now also had a gap in her memory. She had no
recollection of anything that had transpired while she had been
hypnotized. Pierre Janet noted:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Nevertheless, thanks to these artificial somnambulisms, we were able
to nourish her and cause her to recover her strength. But it was
always impossible to make her eat in the period considered normal,
which we always brought back by awakening her. So that, tired of thus
putting her to sleep at each meal, which was very long, we left her
for whole days in the artificial state. The only result was
apparently a great advantage, since all day she ate well, urinated
completely, and presented more sensibility, memory, and activity. One
day her parents, finding her in this fine artificial state, considered
her cured, and took her out of the hospital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
The "artificial state," however, did not last. With her first
menstrual period, Marceline relapsed into her "normal" state, but this
time she had forgotten the weeks since leaving the hospital. All the
symptoms returned, and her parents brought her back to the hospital.
"In the presence of all these disturbances," Janet reports, "I could
do nothing else but put her to sleep again, or rather bring her back
to her artificial state" (<I>MSH,</I> 88). He continues:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Incredibly enough, this situation continued for fifteen years.
Marceline would come to me in order to be put to sleep, enter into
her alert state, and then go away very happy, with complete activity,
sensibility, and memory. She would remain thus for a few weeks;
 <b></b> then, either slowly or suddenly, in consequence of some emotion,
fall back into her numbness, return to the state we had considered
primitive and natural, with the same visceral disturbances. The
forgetfulness now extended over whole years, and disturbed her
existence completely. She would hasten to come to me to get herself
transformed again. Things continued thus for years together, till the
death of the poor girl, who succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis.
[<I>MSH</I>, 88-89]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
Marceline's is an important case because it underlines how the study
of hysteria became a study of what is normal. Which is the normal
woman? How do we measure progress? One clear measure of her progress
is that she is eating, that she is not near death. But she must be
hypnotized in order to be "normal," and the cost of this progress is
her increasing dependence on hypnotism and on the doctor. For Janet,
"the provoked somnambulism became for this patient a second existence
more complete than the first and was entirely substituted for
it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Do we read this as the loss of self or as the
acquisition of a reasonable self given to her by the physician?

<P>
Janet came to understand his patient as having lived in a normal state
before puberty. Her problem was not that she had more than one
personality. Jules Janet had stressed that everyone has two
personalities, but most people have their first at least as strong as
the second. Thus, the second personality, the unconscious one, only
erupts in dreams, when drunk, and very occasionally.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

Pierre came to believe that when they found Marceline in her anoretic
state, she had already lost her normal self, and one of the chief
signs of this loss was her amnesia. Hypnosis restored her memory and
thus her first personality. By reconnecting her to the past the
physician returned her to normality. Her second, disordered,
destructive personality could be kept at bay through the forces of
memory.

<P>
But the forces of memory relied on the power of hypnosis wielded by
the physician. The success of the treatment depended on the patient's
vulnerability to suggestion, but this vulnerability itself was a sign
of the illness: "The very power of our suggestions, which seems to us
positive, is a mark of the profound disagregation of the mind, and the
more the recovery appears to be easy, the more the mind is, in
reality, sick."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Those patients who were apparently healed
through suggestion developed a need for more suggestion, a
"surprisingly violent" need to confess, to be directed. Suggestion can
not set the patient free from the illness, because in hysteria <I>"la
passion somnambulique"</I> (the hypnotic passion) is at the center of
the illness (<I>NIF,</I> 211). The physician will naturally think his
treatment is working well, as he sees the patient, eager to please
him, returning for more treatments and apparently improving steadily
as a result of the suggestions, the "moral guidance" he provides. But
the physician should not be fooled:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
The true sign of the recovery of the patient is the departure of the
physician, who one sends away with pleasure; unhappily, this sign does
not exist among the patients with whom we work. They are always
incapable of dismissing their doctor. This influence exercised by the
physician on the patients appears crucial to us in these mental
disturbances.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 <b></b> 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
In cases like Marceline's Janet was inclined to attribute the need for
suggestion to an extremely weak hereditary constitution. The hysteria
is not fixed on a certain idea or a particular memory; it is a global
condition which justifies pessimism about any long-lasting therapeutic
outcome.

<P>
Mme. D.'s amnesia was specific and limited. Although there was some
questionable nervousness in her family's past, she had been basically
healthy until the "lugubrious joke" that the stranger had played on
her. For Janet the case was crucial, because it pointed to what he saw
as the root of traumatic hysteria: dissociation of the personality
provoked by an intense emotion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 How was one to provide
the 
hysteric with renewed capacities for psychological synthesis? One of
the chief 
obstacles was the now elaborated memory of the trauma, which Janet
described as an <I>id&eacute;e fixe.</I> But whereas Charcot's
neuro-hynpnotic approach to Mme. D. was to find an efficacious
suggestion to remember, Janet explored how forgetting might be
essential to cure: "One of the most precious discoveries of
pathological psychology would be that which would give us the certain
means to provoke the forgetting of a specific psychological
phenomenon."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 

<P>
After months of failing to get Mme. D. to make the false report a
conscious memory, he attempted "to suppress it" <I>("la
supprimer")</I> or at least "to modify it" <I>("la modifier")</I> so
as to make it less frightening. While hypnotized, Mme. D. heard a
knock at the door--but instead of the stranger entering the
house, it was the psychologist himself! And instead of announcing the
terrifying news, Janet's image said only: "Mme. D., prepare a bed
because I would like to sleep at your house in M."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Now
when Mme. D. had the recurrent dream about the incident, it aroused
much less emotion, thus allowing her personality to integrate the
various segments of the past into her personal memory. Janet
de-elaborates the memory and thus removes its potency. In Charcot's
terms, by manipulating the image he destroys its ability to 
continue to affect the nervous system. The past is in the way. By
changing the past, the psychologist opens the possibilities of new
memory for Mme. D.

<P>
Janet's interest in real trauma has made him an important re for
recent feminist critiques of Freud, and his emphasis on dissociation
rather than repression has drawn the attention of many who work with
people victimized by violence or traumatic accidents.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The
Freudian concept of repression always involves the question of desire;
how does the person's ambivalence interact with memory to disturb the 
present? Janet was usually uninterested in this sort of question,
concentrating instead on eliminating the potency of the link to the
past. Although he departed from Charcot's neurological model in very
significant ways, Janet also regarded memory as a potentially
pathogenic element, but one that could be diffused through certain
techniques in the present. The potency of the past for both men was
extremely 
dangerous, and Janet emphasized how forgetting was essential to any
healthy existence. "[I]t is more difficult than one generally believes
to forget something. To know how to forget something is often as
important as to know how to learn, because forgetting is the condition
of forward movement, of progress, of life itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 An
element from the past which disturbed the possibilities for
psychological synthesis (a trauma) <b></b> could be removed, or at least
recomposed. "In a word, after the disappearance of the <I>id&eacute;e
fixe,</I> the unity of the spirit is reconstituted."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The
hygienic attributes of forgetting led the psychologist to reach beyond
psychopathology for a general social law: "Forgetting is very often a
virtue of individuals and peoples. 'It is necessary to know how to
forget,' said Taine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>


<P>
Janet struggled to find techniques that would give his traumatized
patients the capacity to forget. Escaping from the grip of the past
did not involve returning to it, or coming to understand its
significance for one's present. The doctor could remove one's memory
of the past, or at least change the past that one remembered.
Nietzsche wrote that the will's "gnashing of teeth" and its "secret
melancholy" was that it could not will backwards, it could not change
the past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 With hypnosis, Janet (and many of those around
him) thought he had found a treatment that could.

<P>
Janet used hypnosis as a technology of forgetting in a variety of
circumstances. In their somnambulistic states, hysterics had their
traumatic memories or <I>id&eacute;es fixes</I> removed like malignant
tumors; or, perhaps more accurately, the growths were rendered benign.
Of course, in these conditions, it is not the patient's will which is
"willing backwards." It is the physician's will (in the form of
suggestion) which enters into the psyche of the patient when her or
his own will is suspended through hypnosis. Janet regarded suggestion
as an important psychological phenomenon, but (and here he remained
linked with Charcot's school against the claims of Bernheim and the
school of Nancy) he also regarded it as pathological. The more
vulnerable one was to suggestion, the less stable was one's own
psychological synthesis. Traumatic events were those that disrupted
this synthesis, allowing unhealthy suggestions to develop into
generally pathological behavior. Janet did not classify the types of
events that might become traumatic. Everything depended on the overall
health of one's psychological constitution--analogous to Charcot's
neurological predisposition. If there were degenerate hereditary
factors at work, the hysteric would only imitate psychological
synthesis to satisfy his or her desire for suggestion. In cases where
symptoms were caused by an isolated traumatic event, Janet believed
that a healthy personal psychological synthesis could be restored by
removing the experiences that had 
disrupted it. 

<P>
Another case of Janet's provides an example of restoration through a
transformation of the past. "Achille" thought he was possessed by the
devil, but the psychologist discovered that it was the past that had
taken control of his life. In "A Case of Possession," Janet exorcises
the past with the powerful tools of the new science. After making
Achille's internal devil obey his commands under hypnosis, Janet was
able to discover the precipitating cause, the <I>id&eacute;e fixe</I>
behind his patient's ornate "medieval delusions." Achille had been
sexually unfaithful to his wife, was consumed by fear and guilt, and
was possessed by a subconscious emotion of remorse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 How
to remove the remorse? Remove the sin, and the remorse and the
delusions around it would also vanish. "An idea, a memory, can be
considered as a system of images that one can destroy in separating
its elements, in altering them separately, in substituting in the
compound one or another partial image for those which
exist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 In the case of <b></b> Achille, an hallucination of
his wife could be integrated through hypnotic suggestion into his
reconred memory of adultery <I>"au moment convenable"</I> (at the
opportune moment; <I>EMH,</I> 404). Thus, in rearranging the past, the
psychologist grants a full pardon. Achille, we are told, returned home
and remained in good health.

<P>
In this case of what he called <I>l'exorcisme moderne,</I> Janet
participates in the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re school's effort to use
the tools of modern science to redescribe phenomena that had been
thought to belong either to the world of religion or to the realm of
the paranormal. In the <I>Biblioth&egrave;que Diabolique</I> series
and in a variety of other publications, Charcot and his disciples used
the language of psychopathology to demystify religious experience. Not
only did they argue that witches were hysterics and not criminals,
they also rewrote the biographies of saints to show that they, too,
were hysterical. As they did with hypnosis, the doctors were
attempting to show the power of their new techniques over material
once thought to lie beyond the borders of science. By bringing this
material into the scientific domain, the doctors were claiming new
territory for the empire of rational investigation and thereby
increasing their own power within the contest of competing scientific
disciplines.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>


<P>
But if hypnosis and suggestion offered a language that could be used
to redescribe religious and paranormal phenomena, it also confronted
some investigators with occurrences that deeply shook their scientific
presuppositions. The experts in hypnosis at the end of the century
were not only to be found at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re and other
hospitals, but were also scattered around the country in carnivals,
s&eacute;ance halls, and even the living rooms of the bourgeoisie.
Despite Charcot's stern warnings about the danger of these
unprofessional practitioners of hypnosis, in fin-de-si&egrave;cle
France they remained enormously popular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 And some of
their most faithful auditors were men of science who sought not so
much to bring the hypnotists or mediums within the territory of
science, but to use their work to destroy its borders.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P>
Perhaps the most important and interesting of these res is Charles
Richet.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
Richet's interest in hypnotism and in the
mesmerists preceded Charcot's by several years, but since he did not
medicalize the phenomena his work at first had little impact on the
scientific community. A professor of physiology at the Sorbonne,
Richet emphasized that the self was comprised of memory, and
investigated hypnotism's capacity to erase one's personal memories and
substitute for them another set of images, another self.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

In cases of "artificial somnambulism", the new collection of images
were the suggestions given by the hypnotist. Hysterics and those who 
suffered from a <I>d&eacute;doublement de la personnalit&eacute;</I>
(doubling of the personality) were often cases of spontaneous or
natural somnambulism. How did suggestion work for them? Richet, like
Janet, was fascinated by memories which seemed to work outside of
consciousness. These memories functioned as suggestions, creating
alternate 
personalities.

<P>
For Richet, memory was the "prolongation of an excitation" (<I>la
prolongation d'une excitation</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 After some event was
registered, the registration remained a permanent trace of the event.
Conscious memory was just that bit of the past that we <b></b> could
recall at any given time. In fact, memory was much broader, since
nothing was ever lost to it. 

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
As one has said for a long time, no fact disappears from memory:
everything is fixed in it. Everything acts on us and leaves an
indelible trace. Our intellectual existence at a moment is the result
of all the impressions received in our past existence. How few, in
this immense number, are perceived by consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
In order to investigate this broader memory, one had to make use of
subjects who had access to the world beyond consciousness, and for
Richet, like many of his 
colleagues, this meant work on psychopathologies. In addition,
however, Richet was drawn to people on the margins of conventional
society who claimed to have access not only to other states of
consciousness but also to other worlds. The truth was revealed at the
margins, whether these were in hospital wards or spiritist
s&eacute;ances. As Joseph Maxwell, a colleague of Azam's in Bordeaux's
hospitals and an assiduous participant in s&eacute;ances of the
paranormal with Richet, said: "From the beginning of my experiments .
. . I understood that one could study certain apparently supernormal
manifestations only with the aid of mental and nervous
pathology."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>


<P>
Many of Charcot's colleagues (including Janet) were interested in
paranormal phenomena. In the work for his doctoral dissertation Janet
researched the claims of a medium, and Charcot's last publication
dealt with faith healing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 But as we have seen, this sort
of work was usually in the mode of demystification, the mode of 
showing how the extraordinary claims made for paranormal phenomena
were either fraudulent or easily explained through the conventional
categories of science (often of medicine). Richet thought of himself
as a much more open-minded researcher than his counterparts at the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re because he was ready to accept the possible
occurrence of some phenomena that the doctors would never consider.
Thus, he was one of the most enthusiastic researchers into that which
could not be explained through our conventional understanding of the
natural world. He wed a conventional belief in scientific progress
(plus real scientific achievement) with an enormous appetite for the
occult and the abnormal.

<P>
For example, Richet stressed the reasonableness of research into the
appearance of ghosts. Now that we can communicate across space
(through the telegraph and the telephone), the next task is to
communicate over time. To communicate over time meant ultimately to
eliminate the border of death. We do not expect to talk to our dearly
departed grandparents, he assured his readers. But we do expect our
great-grandchildren to contact us. That is what scientific progress is
all about.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 There would be nothing about this that
violated the laws of nature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 On the contrary, Richet
emphasized, our increased understanding and control of nature would
allow us to overcome the temporal and spatial constraints that
currently governed our lives. This was, after all, what science and
technology had been doing throughout the second half of the nineteenth
century. He was, he kept reminding his readers, a very reasonable
man.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 <b></b> 

<P>
As a biologist interested in memory, it seemed plausible to Richet to
move from the rational investigation of hypnotism and memory into
scientific research on life after death. The physiological basis of
memory was the "prolongation of an excitation," a trace left somewhere
independently of one's awareness. Hypnotism showed that human memory
was far more extensive than human consciousness. Richet began with the
nineteenth-century scientific truism that nothing disappeared from
memory and then wondered whether traces of the past continued to exist
independently of the normal human capacity to recall them. If the
material basis of memory was simply the "prolongation of an
excitation," then perhaps there were media other than the brain in
which this prolongation continued. Perhaps normal recall was only one
way to access past time, and there were other possibilities
unreasonably 
excluded by mere prejudice.

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
This does not mean that what is occult today will be occult tomorrow.
Three hundred years ago, electricity was an occult force. Before
Schelle and Lavoisier, chemistry was an occult science and was called
alchemy; and it is only scarcely twenty years ago that animal
magnetism ceased to be an occult science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
Elsewhere, Richet wrote, "It is the first time that one dares to study
<I>scientifically</I> that which follows death. Who, then, will dare
to say, without having cast an eye on this work, that it is a
folly?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 He wanted only to collect evidence for further
scientific work, and he defended his work on telepathy and on
spiritism with a straightforward appeal to empiricism. We must have
the facts before we can try to make sense of these extraordinary
claims!

<P>
Photography was the privileged medium for presenting these facts in
the late nineteenth century, as it was considered by many as the
technology that perfectly copied the world even while prolonging, in a
real sense, its excitations. Richet used photography not to define and
hence limit what counts as real, but instead to change the way we
understood the nature of reality and our connection to it. The
photographic plate could record aspects of the world that our eyes (at
least the eyes of most people) were not sensitive enough to register.
For those who believed that our unaided senses offered us only the
most superficial connection to reality, photography provided a tool to
investigate the possibility of other realms, other modes of existence
(e.g., the supernatural, the abnormal). It also was used to provide
evidence of the appearance of these other realms in our reality.
Nothing, after all, escapes the camera. In this regard, the camera was
imagined to be like memory, for which nothing was ever lost. The
photograph <I>materialized</I> an event, fixing movement in a
concrete, physical process. The abnormal could be made available for
all to see.

<P>
Thus, many photographers were not only seeking the banal, the
everyday, but they were on the hunt for the abnormal and the extreme.
Reality contained more than most people ever saw, and the camera could
expand the normal range of the 
visible by bringing the abnormal into it. Photographers went into the
hospitals to <b></b> photograph the sick, into the asylums to photograph
the insane, into the jails to 
capture the prisoners (forever), into the s&eacute;ances to record how
hypnosis was used to communicate with the beyond of the unconscious
and the beyond of the <I>apr&egrave;s mort</I> (world after death).
The transmission of something like the <I>fluide vitale</I> (vital
fluid), long appealed to by mesmerists, magnetizers, mediums, and
hypnotists, would be <I>seen</I> through photographic inscription. In
late-nineteenth-century France, these "extreme photographs" were used
to expand the domain of the real, or at least to alter the conception
of reality and its representation that had come to be accepted in the
fin-de-si&egrave;cle.

<P>
Photographs of ghosts were used as evidence of the existence of an
afterlife, or at least of some world beyond the one visible to us in
space and time. These pictures should be seen as part of a more
general effort to find a place for the non-material in a culture
increasingly dominated by technological change and scientific
legitimation. In the age of positivism the search for some evidence of
the existence of an afterlife took on new forms. The acceleration of
secularization in official culture in the last decades of the
nineteenth century reconred the organization of interest in the
"spiritual" or "non-material" world. The increasing pace of
technological change and scientific advance both explained more about
the natural world and opened more mysteries in it. The development of
electric power, the invention of the recording phonograph and the
discovery of X rays are only a few of the markers of what was taken to
be both signs of scientific power and indices of the profound
mysteriousness of nature. For many, photography offered the
possibility of recording this mysteriousness with one of the most
powerful and accessible products of scientific progress. As Gabriel
Delanne put it in 1893:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
We see how much importance critics attach to photographic proof; it
establishes, in fact, irresistibly, the certainty that one has really
witnessed an objective phenomenon, and that there is no question of
hallucination in the sight of the materialized spirit. . . . Well, we
spirits, we have just told the positivists: we have become your
disciples, we have adopted your method, and we accept as true that the
truths demonstrated by analysis, the senses, and
observation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
The disciples of positivism would bring one of its favorite tools into
the dark cabinets of spiritism. There the camera would ratify the
reality of phenomena that otherwise would lie beyond the limits of the
scientific imagination. S&eacute;ance-goers were no more the dupes of
fake mediums than were physicians falling for the malingering of false
hysterics. Photography would substantiate the reality of the
phenomenon. One of the key words here is materialization: the process
through which the spiritual or mental world, and especially the world
of the past, is made manifest to us. Photography is the medium that
can give this process a permanent, concrete form. 

<P>
Photography was a powerful example of how an increased understanding
of 
natural processes allowed us to have deeper insight into and control
over the real. Already in the 1870s, attempts to photograph ghosts
were in full swing. Photography <b></b> could stop time (although,
through the 1870s, it still took some time to get a proper exposure),
thus making a permanent trace of reality. Thus photography could be
used to satisfy--or at least address--the desire to remain in contact
with the dead. Photographic portraits of the dead rapidly became a
commonplace in late-
nineteenth-century bourgeois France, with many of the big Parisian
studios advertising portraits <I>d'apr&egrave;s dec&eacute;s</I>
(after death) as part of their repertoire of services for the
consumer. These portraits were usually taken in the hours just after
death, when the pain of loss was most acute and the possibilities of
photographic preservation most apparent. In the 1870s, however, an
enterprising Parisian photographer, Buguet, had the idea of using the
medium to photograph the deceased even after they had been long
buried. He brought mournful clients to his studio at 5 Boulevard
Montparnasse where they would be kept waiting with another "client"
who in 
reality was an associate of the photographer and who acquired
information about the physical characteristics of the deceased. When
the real client entered the studio proper, he or she was asked to
concentrate on the dearly departed. Buguet explained that through a
very special process the photographic plate could capture the
connection that was established between the intense memory of the
client and the deceased. After finishing the supposed exposure, the
photographer withdrew into a second studio where he sketched on the
plate an impression of a head to "satisfy all tastes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

Buguet's studio became well known, and it was even doing a mail order
business ("concentrate on the photographer and the deceased, and our
special camera can record the image . . . distance is no obstacle").
Satisfaction was guaranteed. If the picture does not look at all like
your loved one, send it back and we'll try again. Eventually, the
police took an interest in the studio, and when Buguet produced a
picture of what was supposed to be the commissaire's deceased wife, he
was 
promptly arrested. The commissaire had never married.

<P>
The photographic con artist became notorious after his 1875 trial, and
the photography of spirits fell into general disrepute by the late
1870s. But with the increased scientific importance given to hypnotism
and hysteria in the 1880s and 1890s, photographers were once again
enlisted to make the abnormal real and concrete. Hysteria was said by
many to be the somatization of desires and of traumatic memory; this
process could be revealed by hypnosis. Hysterical symptoms were the
materialization of the past, of the hysteric's wounded memory.
Physicians, psychologists and philosophers worked extensively with
mediums who could reproduce hysterical symptoms when in hypnotic
trance. The hypnotic trance allowed the hysteria to take a material
form. The trance could also allow the spirit to take material form.
Photography could record this <I>materialization</I> of the beyond
just as it had recorded the somatization of the hysterical desire in a
symptom.

<P>
One of the prominent theories of hypnosis in the last two decades of
the century linked the trance to "the doubling of personality." The
person (usually a woman) in the hypnotic trance was said to enter into
(or create) another personality. According to Aleksandr Aksakof, the
photographic plate was able to register the form of this other
personality--as distinct from the body of the person in trance. For
Aksakof, the <b></b> photograph reveals something that is not visible to
the human eye. The light-
sensitive plate can capture things that elude us. Aksakof here goes
beyond using the camera to make permanent astonishing but ephemeral
things we have seen. He thinks of photography as offering us a new
tool for recording the invisible so as to expand what we can
see.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>


<P>
Hyppolite Baraduc was one of photography's most ardent explorers of
the invisible. Unlike the scientists who went to s&eacute;ances armed
with a camera in case a ghost appeared, Baraduc was using the
light-sensitive plate to record what we never could see, attempting to
create an "iconography of the invisible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 In this realm,
"nothing is lost . . . everything is transformed; and if we now
rediscover the earthly dust of worlds or of beings that have existed,
we should also be able to rediscover <I>v&eacute;cues
potentialities</I> [lived potentialities], the shadows of those who
have passed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Photography is not limited to the body, but
can register the vital forces that continue to emanate from our
spirit. Thus, photography is our chief weapon against time; not
because it can freeze the moment in which action takes place but
because it can show us that <I>nothing is lost</I> in our world. Death
is only transformation and photography can give us evidence of the
results of this process.

<P>
The publication of photographs that claimed to show the mysterious
forces at work in our universe quickly resulted in essays that
challenged the interpretations of the images. For the brothers
Lumi&egrave;re, writing in the 1890s, the halo effect that so
captivated Baraduc was only a technical problem of certain cameras or
plates, and it could be alleviated through the choice of particular
lenses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>


<P>
If photographs of the invisible were dismissed as illusions generated
in the darkroom, how was one to explain the photographs that recorded
the very strange phenomena that were occurring in s&eacute;ances at
the end of the century? Verbal reports from even the most
distinguished observers could be dismissed or attributed to
<I>tromperie</I> (fraud), but who could "deny the reality of the
photograph?" With the advent of 
fairly rapid exposure times and of flash photography, cameras joined
scientific observers to document how the hypnotic trance (variously
red as access to an unconscious, a second personality, or a
different dimension of temporality) allowed another world to become
visible in ours. One of the great products of this effort to document
the reality of the spirit world through photography is Julliete
Alexandre-Bisson's <I>Les Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes dits de
mat&eacute;rialisation: &eacute;tude experimentale,</I> published in
1914, based on her experiments in the late nineteenth and the early
twentieth 
centuries with Dr. Schrenk-Notzing and the medium Eva. These
experiments produced "ectoplasm" the substance that emerges from the
medium as a sign of the beyond (this, after all her orifices had been
checked before the s&eacute;ance by Schrenk-Notzing and other
observers to guard against trickery), and ideoplasms. Ideoplasms were
images that appeared above or behind the medium's head--faces of a
spirit called from the beyond. The photographer could capture that
ephemeral image in a permanent form.

The ectoplasm that emerges from the medium's mouth or other bodily
cavities was evidence of contact with the beyond, and the ideal
photograph would show the <b></b> medium in the throes of putting forth
this mysterious substance (. 
<a href="3.2roth_1.html">
1</a> - 
<a href="3.2roth_2.html">

example is when the ghostly image seems to emerge out of the
ectoplasm--so we have a double dose of evidence from another world
grasped by the photographic apparatus (. 
<a href="3.2roth_3.html">
3</a> - 
<a href="3.2roth_4.html">
4</a>).

<P>
If it was difficult to doubt the veracity of the photographic
recording (<I>something</I> was in front of the camera and the
witnesses), it was very possible to question what was being recorded.
Skeptical critics pointed out that the ideoplasms resembled
photographs of famous people that had appeared in popular magazines;
the medium had cut these out, attached them to a stick and a black
sheet, and in the dark room someone had waved them about in front of
the gullible s&eacute;ance participants. The photo of the so-called
"ideoplasm," the critics claimed, was really a photo of a photo! <b></b> 

<P>
Schrenk-Notzing replied that the ideoplasm was a materialization of
the medium's hypnotized memory of a photograph. First there is the
photo of a famous person. The image becomes part of the medium's
extraordinary memory, and these mnemonic powers cause a
materialization of the image, which is then photographed by the
investigator. Thus, the ideoplasm is not a fraud, it is the return of
the image to the concrete through a powerful projection of memory. The
photographer in the s&eacute;ance records this projection, and the
image produced should count as evidence of the 
reality of the powers of the medium's memory. The medium's powers were
real, even if they led only to the imitation of an image. And
photography's powers to document remained substantial, even if they
led only to copies of other photographs in the effort to realize the
fervent desire to see beyond the visible and to live beyond the limits
of mortality.

<P>
We saw above that doctors working with hysterics considered their
symptoms as materializations of the past. In the hospitals, too,
photography became a privileged medium for representing these
materializations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 And these doctors so concerned with the
fragility and the malleability of memory sought to register their own
work <b></b> with permanence. In 1875 Bourneville and Regnard set up a
photographic service in Charcot's wing of the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, and soon after they began publishing
pictures alongside their case studies. This was six years after the
establishment of the Photographic Revue of the Hospitals of Paris, a
publishing venture in which Bourneville became an editor in 1870.
Photography gave direct access to the Truth, and the directors of the
journal hoped to have as much success with their medium as did
clinical photographers of skin disease who had been at work already
for some time. Charcot considered himself not a theorist of hysteria,
but someone who was able to see it more clearly than anyone else.
Seeing things cleanly, grasping them with the eye and without theory
was an attempt to see them outside of time. The perfect instrument for
that (the perfect weapon, as Didi-Huberman has said) was photography.
It was photography that helped the celebrated doctor respond to the
charge that the hysterics in the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re were merely
imitating the disease that Charcot and his famous patients had
prescribed for them. In 1887 the doctor wrote: "It would be something
truly miraculous if I could thus create these diseases according to my
caprice and my fantasy. But the truth is that I am there absolutely
only the photographer; I inscribe what I see."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 The doctor
is a light-sensitive plate, he merely receives and records the
symptoms. 

<P>
The difficulty with this analogy, however, is that the doctor himself
is both discursive--the images must be translated into words (what is
lost in the translation?)--and transitory (when he is no longer there
to see, what he has seen disappears). The photographic study is the
perfect complement to the vision of the doctor. The photograph
dispenses with the need for words; nothing can be lost in the
translation. The photograph is permanent, an absolute memory which
will be fresh long after the doctor is gone. But <I>what</I> is seen?

In one photograph (<a href="3.2roth_5.html"> 5</a>), published in 
1878, we see Augustine 
in her normal state. Where in this picture is the hysteria? Where is the
recording or the inscription of a disease? A photograph like
"Tetanisme" (<a href="3.2roth_6.html"> 6</a>) is to reveal the 
core of the illness, or perhaps
the signs of the illness. Or is it that in hysteria the signs are the
core of the disease? By now the series of images known as <I>Attitudes
Passionnelles</I> (hysterical postures) are quite familiar (.
7 - 9).[<a href="3.2roth_7.html">

 8</a>][<a href="3.2roth_9.html">  9</a>]
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 There are many more photographs of Augustine
in the various positions that had come to be famous as the positions
of 
hysteria. The camera, like Doctor Charcot, is presented as inventing
nothing, 
suggesting nothing. The photographic imperative will see all, will
demand revelation from <I>the patient.</I> The photographic imperative
must see into the disease. The model seems to have been the
photographs which were eventually housed in the museum of
dermatological disorders. These images are able to enclose the disease
as they record its signs. The diseased organ, the skin, is there
before us in these pictures; but where is Augustine's disease? Where
is it <I>located?</I>

<P>
The photographic imperative will record what is revealed. But with the
hysteric, the camera's desire to reveal is itself recorded in the look
(even when the eyes are closed) of Augustine. The hysteric is the
subject who will be revealed, and although in this period male
hysteria is recognized (with some pride) as a possibility, it is
the <b></b> <b>[Begin Page 22]</b> woman who is revealed by the 
male doctor and his camera. Knowing
the desire for revelation, acknowledging this desire in her own look,
in the positions of her body, becomes a part of hysterical desire, and
perhaps of hysterical suffering. We see revealed by the photographs
the desire for revelation of the photographer, of the psychiatrist
whose fantasy of passively recording the desire of these women becomes
part of their desire, becomes part of their hysteria. And, of course,
the <I>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</I> of these pictures, their artfulness,
discloses the futility and the denials of this dream of passive
recording. In the Archives de l'Assistance Publique one can consult
what seems to be some of the original photographs eventually published
in the <I>Iconographie.</I> On the back of a few of them, written
lightly in pencil, there are instructions to the photographer for
publication-ready copies: "Lighten a little the bottom of the clothes
and the hands; accentuate the eyes in the sentiment of the gaze
<I>[sentiment du regard];</I> put a few creases in the
blouse."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>


<P>
This was frustrating work for the physician and his photographer. The
hysteric's illness, according to many, was in her deception, her
<I>appearance</I> of illness. This did not mean she was faking, or
that she was not ill. As the psychiatrist Lasegue noted, not anybody
who pleases can be a hypochondriac; the symptoms of hysteria could be
lies, but they were still symptoms of a real illness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>

(Remember the photograph of the ghost/photograph.) How does the
hysteric force her body to lie? How could photography, in recording
that lie, capture the truth? What if the hysteric's production of
symptoms is stimulated, aroused by the photographer's sensitive
recording of appearance? The attempt of the physician to record the
hysteric, to commit her through images to a memory which knew no
forgetting, placed the photographic imperative within the dialectics
of hysterical desire, by which I mean a desire for recognition
combined with a radical denial of the possibilities for satisfying
this desire. The physician/photographer was in the position to reward
the hysteric by 
seeing (and preserving) her as a model of the disease. The hysteric
was in the position of rewarding the physician/photographer by giving
him the model of hysteria. The pictures were immediately criticized
for being modeled, that is, for picturing merely imitations of
symptoms. The models were too good. The women, the critics said, were
only responding to suggestion, not from some trauma in the past, but
from the doctors or other patients. The photographs only recorded the
product of the 
suggestion. But was susceptibility to suggestion a real disease, and,
if so, how was it to be recorded?

<P>
After leaving the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, Dr. Bourneville became the
director of the service of hysteria, epilepsy, and idiocy at
Bic&ecirc;tre, a men's hospital outside of Paris. At his new post, the
doctor continued to make use of photography. He wanted to commit the
physicians' work on disease to memory in forms that escaped the
problems of the interdependence of the hysteric and her photographer.
Bourneville is an exceptionally interesting character. An accomplished
physician, he was a radically anticlerical deputy to the National
Assembly. Not content with chasing the church from hospitals and
positions of pedagogic power, Bourneville edited the
<I>Biblioth&egrave;que </I> <b></b> <I>Diabolique,</I> which published
retrospective diagnoses of saints and miracle workers as hysterics
<I>avant la lettre.</I>

<P>
In 1885 Bourneville established the <I>mus&eacute;e pathologique</I>
(pathological museum) at Bic&ecirc;tre. The museum collected human
skeletons, bones of animals, and fetuses in various stages of
development. Mme. Forino, a midwife from the suburb of Gentilly,
considerably enriched the museum's collection with her own 
 private holdings in 1886. The museum also contained portraits of
physicians at the hospital, and photographs of patients in various
stages of their illness, including portraits of the dead and of 
cadavers during autopsies. Bourneville seemed to worry that the public
would think of the museum as a collection of curiosities, and in the
<I>Bulletins</I> of 1887, and also 1888, 1889, and 1890, he repeated
that he had not collected objects for the merely curious, but
materials to be used in serious research. Not only should physicians
be able to use the museum for further study, the 
general public should find there the evidence of medicine's steady
progress against the ravages of disease.

<P>
In 1887 Parisian newspapers reported the visit of the Minister of the
Interior to the pathological museum at Bic&ecirc;tre. The museum was
made up of one room that stored specimens meant to shed light on
various diseases: epilepsy, idiocy, hysteria. A favorite technique for
preserving the signs of disease were wax models of bodies twisted by
illness. But photography remained a privileged form. One paper noted
that the minister stopped for some time before photographs of children
under the care of Bourneville. "It  was easy to follow the phases
of the disease. To the extent that the patient entered the path of
healing, the structure of the face is modified, the brutal impression
of characteristics is attenuated, pupils are dilated, the eyes become
clear and lively and the cheeks are colored and take on a shade of
freshness and health."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Progress for the patient. Progress
for the doctor. Progress for the minister.

<P>
But these are not the photographs I have seen. What remains of the
<I>mus&eacute;e pathologique</I> are not signs of progress but signs
of the inexorable degradation that disease brings. We see children
standing next to a measuring stick when admitted to the unit; we see
them next in various stages of their stay in the hospital. In one
series, a young girl, Blaise, is shown looking scared, small but
almost precious next to the measuring rod. Like all the other children
in these pictures, she is clothed in warm, winter greys. Then we see
her some months later and the illness has overwhelmed the person. We
then see her dead, photographed on the cold metal table. But this is
not the end of the story: the insistence on taking the camera to the
core of the disease ends up with a photograph of a brain, which the
inscription beneath tells us was once hers.

In other photographs (. 10-14) we see the death
masks--or should I call them death skulls?--made
before autopsy.

They are among the many found tucked away on the
shelves in the basement of the Museum of Public Assistance of the City
of Paris. Some of the skulls show extraordinary deformations. Others
are striking for their expression, the wisps of hair which still cling
to eyelashes and scalp after a hundred years. The skulls--and remember
the claim that these were not objects of curiosity, but tools for
serious research--were kept in cabinets to be seen by hospital
visitors, doctors, and those who would in the future admire the work
done to understand illness and heal the sick. <b></b> 

<P>
Charcot had told the doctors in his department that they should think
of the extraordinary number and diversity of 
ailments available to them at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re as a vast
<I>mus&eacute;e pathologique vivant</I> (living museum of pathology).
Later, like Bourneville, he aimed at something more permanent, and
more public. A museum that would house the challenges and triumphs of
the new school of psychiatry. Bourneville, in his pathological museum
at Bic&ecirc;tre, wanted to inscribe his work in permanent forms:
photography, wax res, plaster skulls. A living museum, a museum of
the living, would die, its res disappear. With photographs and
sculpture, the terror of illness and the capacities of medicine to
overcome that terror could be rendered permanent. Memory, these
doctors knew, had to be embodied. But bodies, they also knew,
degraded, vanished. The <I>mus&eacute;e pathologique</I> would
overcome forgetting in a permanent tribute to scientific progress and
the powerful physicians who made it possible.

<P>
But as I said, the skulls are in the basement of a museum, and not one
known for attracting long lines of people. There is almost nothing
left of Charcot's museum at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. Soon after
these doctors died, their memorials were unfunded, their 
treasures unclaimed or dispersed. The museum's traces, its remains,
have been almost forgotten. What do these photographs and plaster
res still express of the doctors' hopes for recognition, for
permanent progress; what do they express of the patients' agony in the
final degradation of disease?

<P>
Following Charcot, Freud wrote of hysterical symptoms as residues and
mnemonic symbols of particular experiences. He  compared the
signs of disease to monuments and other symbols of
memory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 In late-nineteenth-century French psychiatry,
Freud learned to think of hysteria as the failure to overcome trauma.
A fixed idea is elaborated into a symptom or into a sign, the past
remains in the present. The doctors, too, tried to keep the past in
full view of the present. Of course, they did not embody past traumas,
they tried to memorialize past triumphs. French doctors at the end of
the nineteenth century seized new technologies of representation to
immortalize patients whose pasts continued to wound them. In so doing,
it would be too much to say they behaved like their hysterical
patients. But we can see how the pathological museums came to resemble
the hysterics in their display of temporal disorder; the painful
disruptions of hysteria and the cool display of disease and death in
the museum are inverted metaphors for one another. Both embodied signs
(of achievement, of trauma) which were never to be forgotten. And both
exemplify that desire which can become pathological: the desire to
overcome memory and forgetting, to overcome the passage of time by
representing and collecting the ephemeral in permanent form.

<p>
These words, with their suggestion of a hoped-for remedy for world
catastrophe, are those of the poet and playwright Antonin Artaud
(1896-1948), the exemplary madman of the modernist avant-garde.
They were written in 1935, shortly before Artaud embarked on his own
quest for the primitive, a journey to visit the Tarahumara Indians of
Mexico. Artaud was, by then, thoroughly disgusted with modern
civilization and profoundly disillusioned about the possibility of
redemption through art. He believed that "reason, a European faculty,
exalted beyond measure by the European mentality, is always an image
of death"; that reason had "created the contemporary despair and the
material anarchy of the world by separating the elements of the world
which a real culture would bring 
together" (<I>SW,</I> 358-59). In Mexico, in the land of the
Tarahumara, Artaud expected to find a true culture, a land of speaking
blood where consciousness and language, instead of causing a rupture
in being, would be the medium of a deep unity between self and world,
spirit and body, intellect and emotion. "Because I kept seeing around
me men lying . . . I felt the need . . . to go away to a place where I
could at least freely advance with my heart," he wrote (<I>PD,</I>
71). "I came to Mexico to make contact with the red earth" (<I>SW,</I>
537). Stopping off in Mexico City, Artaud was dismayed to find that
the city dwellers there had no interest in the Indian cultures
surrounding them. He took this as a bad omen. "Nevertheless," he wrote
in a 
 <b></b> letter home, <I>"the</I> <I>Indians</I> <I>exist</I>. . . . and
soon I am going to reach the Indians . . . and there I hope to be
understood" (<I>SW,</I> 365).

<p>
There is no re who better illuminates the complex relationships
among three closely related <I>topoi</I> of our age: modernism,
madness, and the primitive or tribal mind. A profound influence on
modernist art, perhaps the decisive influence on avant-garde theater,
Artaud clearly had a critical attitude toward many of the central
trends of modern culture and thought. He also spent nine of his last
eleven years in asylums. There he displayed many classical signs and
symptoms of paranoid, 
catatonic, and deteriorated forms of schizophrenia--an illness that
many psychoanalysts and psychiatrists, as well as many
anti-psychiatrists and members of the artistic avant-garde, have seen
as involving a regression to the earliest, most unreflective and
instinct-ridden stages of human life.

<p>
In Artaud's embarking for the land of the Tarahumara, we have the
spectacle of a schizophrenic artist, a person of immense influence on
twentieth-century culture, setting out on his own quest for the
primitive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Ironically enough, he too yearns for the very
mode of life--primal and undivided, imbued with passion, immediacy,
and a sense of mystical participation--that, according to traditional
theoretical accounts, underlies his own psychological
condition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 It seems, then, that the schizophrenic, at
least <I>this</I> schizophrenic, can be as susceptible as anyone else
to the myth and the lure of the primitive; and it is worth asking why
this should be the case. Does Artaud sense a fundamental affinity
between his own mode of being and that of the Tarahumara of his
imagination, living in immediate connection with their emotions and in
symbiosis with the surrounding world? Or could it be just the reverse:
namely, that for Artaud the Tarahumara seemed to offer the haven of an
existence quite antithetical to his own?

<p>
In both worlds where he has been a re of importance,
anti-psychiatry and the artistic avant-garde, Artaud has been
primarily understood in the first way. Since the 1960s he has served
as the paradigmatic instance of the madman as wildman or 
primitive, a person who is supposed to incarnate the irrationalist and
primitivist esthetic of which he is perhaps the most influential
modern exponent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 He is the 
emblematic re for those who adopt Dionysian notions of madness, of
modernism (and postmodernism), and of modernism as a kind of madness;
and he is thought to embody a postromantic or romantic-modernist
esthetic in which insanity has become the privileged "metaphor for
passion," the logical consequence of all strong emotion. <SUP><a 
NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP> Perhaps the classic modern 
expression of this conception is
Nietzsche's vision, in <I>The Birth of Tragedy,</I> of an ecstatic
surrender of self-control that obliterates all doubt and hesitation to
make way for the raptures of unrestrained instinct and primordial
unity. Such a conception of madness has often served as a kind of
objective correlative. It has been used to exemplify the supposedly
Dionysiac nature of the forms of boundary dissolution,
self-fragmentation, and social withdrawal that are common in the
twentieth century avant-garde--a condition in which the coherent self
is said, for instance, to be "dismembered by the very fertility of its
resources" in a "triumph of desiring fantasy," dissolved in "exuberant
fusion with those scenes which offer themselves, <b></b> literally, as
the theater of our desires."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Thus for Sylv&egrave;re
Lotringer, Leo Bersani, and Martin Esslin, Artaud's literary works
display the "uncontrollable, polymorphous movement," "heterogeneous
multiplicity," or "pornographic tyrannies intrinsic to all desire."
They illustrate the triumph of "concrete experience" and "the
unrestrained ecstasies of Dionysus" over abstract thought and the
"Apollonian 
principle." Artaud's texts demonstrate that "emotion released from all
restraint of logic . . . can result in a glorious rhetoric of
unbridled passion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 

<p>
The major works of anti-psychiatry--R. D. Laing's <I>The Politics of
Experience,</I> Foucault's <I>Madness and Civilization,</I> and
Deleuze and Guattari's <I>Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and
Schizophrenia</I>--were all profoundly inspired by their authors'
reading of Artaud. In all of them similar images prevail. Foucault
speaks, for instance, of madness as a "sovereign enterprise of
unreason," a "wild state" of an "inaccessible primitive purity." Laing
describes insanity as a release from constraint and a return to
"primal man" that offers the hope of healing "our own appalling state
of alienation called normality"; while Deleuze and Guattari celebrate
the schizophrenic as the "true hero of desire," who is "closest to the
beating heart of reality" and the "vital biology of the
body."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>


<p>
This Dionysian or primitivist image is largely based on the middle
years of Artaud's career, the time of his most famous work, <I>The
Theater and its Double</I> 
(written 1931-36), and a period that culminated in his trip to
Mexico in 1936. During this, his second period of literary production,
consciousness was conceived altogether negatively, and Artaud threw
himself into activities designed to eclipse it. We will need to pay
closer attention to the lesser-known but, in many respects, more
fundamental first period of Artaud's writing, the decade of the 1920s
and early 
thirties during which he offers the most direct descriptions of the
anguish that was to plague him throughout his life, motivating yet at
the same time undermining his later attempts to escape into immediacy
and absorption. As we shall see, it is this first, in a sense
Apollonian or Socratic phase, that forms the indispensable ground for
understanding not only Artaud's middle or Dionysian period, but also
the strangest, final decade of his life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>


<p>
The present paper is not a work of intellectual or cultural history,
but a case study of a single individual--an individual who, however,
is the most prominent re to stand at the crossroads of psychiatry
and the arts in our century. Investigating Artaud's life and work
reveals a great irony of twentieth-century thought: that the madness
so often imagined to be antithetical to, even perhaps to offer refuge
from, the malaise of modern existence, may in fact be a particularly
excruciating case of this very same condition--bearing, in heightened
form, all its familiar stigmata of distance, deadness, and
self-division.

<p>
Artaud's major preoccupations in his first period, the 1920s and early
thirties, could hardly be less Dionysian in character. His most
persistent theme in this period is, as <b></b> he terms it in <I>The
Umbilicus of Limbo</I> , "a <I>congealing</I> of the marrow, an
absence of mental fire, a failure of the circulation of life"
(<I>SW,</I> 72). In <I>Fragments of a Diary from Hell</I> (written
1925), he describes himself as "definitively apart from life . . .
stigmatized by a living death" (<I>SW,</I> 92), and elsewhere he
writes, "I am made of blood, obviously I am made of blood. But I
cannot see myself right now. I do not think of myself as being alive"
(<I>PWW,</I> 82). In a typical passage from this period lasting eight
to ten years, Artaud compares himself to an emptiness or absence and
to a robot that is nevertheless aware of some inner rift: "God . . .
has kept me alive in a void of negations and stubborn self-disavowals.
. . . He has reduced me to being a walking robot, but a robot who can
feel the rupture of his unconscious" (<I>PWW,</I> 81).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>


<p>
In such texts as <I>The Nerve Meter</I> , Artaud speaks
repeatedly of the "disembodiment of reality" and of "a kind of
constant leakage of the normal level of 
reality" (<I>SW,</I> 82)--a leakage that originates in the realm of
thought but quickly contaminates even his own most fundamental sense
of bodily existence. "I feel the ground slipping out from under my
thoughts. . . . More than the mind which stays intact . . . it is the
nervous trajectory of thought which this erosion affects and 
subverts. This absence and this standstill are especially felt in the
limbs and blood" (<I>PWW,</I> 68; also <I>SW,</I> 94). Even bodily
sensations seem unreal to him, like fugitive images from a dream he
cannot quite recall: <I>"description</I> <I>of</I> <I>a</I>
<I>physical</I> <I>state:</I> . . . Probably localized in the skin,
but felt as the radical elimination of a limb, and 
presenting to the brain only images of limbs that are threadlike and
woolly, images of limbs that are far away and not where they should
be. A sort of internal fracturing of the whole nervous system"
(<I>SW,</I> 65).

<p>
Artaud complains of a "lack of normal vitality" which, he says,
"prevents me from keeping track of my ideas . . . and from reviewing
at will my opinions and decisions" (<I>PWW,</I> 83). One eerie passage
describes a "great cold, an excruciating abstinence, the limbo of a
nightmare of bones and muscle, with the sensation of the gastric 
functions snapping like a flag in the phosphoresence of the storm.
Larval images that are pushed about as if with a finger and bear no
relation to any substance" (<I>SW,</I> 94). Artaud speaks of a
"shifting vertigo," a state of "oblique bewilderment" (<I>SW,</I> 65)
in which he cannot represent any sort of stable world, either in his
consciousness or in words. Body, mind, and external reality: all seem
distant, uncoordinated, unreal. He lives instead with a chronic
ontological nausea, always on the brink of some vaguely sensed and
ineffable, yet horrifying devastation. Some years later Artaud would
refer to "this private intellectual vacuum" as the main theme of his
writing and the 
"dominant characteristic of my condition" (<I>SW,</I> 290). Artaud's
psychological difficulties had begun in his youth, and he spent
considerable time in sanatoria between 1915 and 1920. A lifelong
struggle with drug addiction, with periodic attempts at
detoxification, began when laudanum was prescribed for him by a doctor
at a sanatorium in Neuch&acirc;tel.

<p>
In his writing of the 1920s, Artaud clearly sees his thinking as the
main locus and source of his problems, which he describes as "a
frightful illness of the mind" (<I>PWW,</I> 60). "I suffer because the
Mind is not in life and life is not the Mind; I suffer from <b></b> the
Mind as organ, the Mind as interpreter, the Mind as intimidator of
things to force them to enter the Mind," he writes in <I>The Umbilicus
of Limbo</I> (<I>SW,</I> 59). For the most part, however, he does not
attempt to escape or suppress thinking. Indeed, at this stage he tends
to see thinking as indispensible to human existence and, potentially
at least, the richest source of the sentiment of being, the feeling of
reality and vitality that constitutes life itself. "That which is true
in life always gives the feeling of intelligence," he writes
(<I>SW,</I> 189), equating "absolute thought" with "life" (<I>PWW,</I>
71), and defying anyone "to imagine that absolutely unthinkable being,
a mind that could really exist without thinking" (<I>SW,</I> 193).
Thinking, for Artaud, is not to be identified with the spontaneous or
semiconscious activities of object-directed awareness; not, for
instance, with a "pure consciousness" that "forbids itself all
self-expression" (<I>SW,</I> 193), but only with some form of reflexive
self-recognition or self-awareness. "Thinking means something more to
me than not being completely dead," he writes.

<p><blockquote><!--_extract-->
It means being in touch with oneself at every moment. It means not
ceasing for a 
single moment to feel oneself in one's inmost being, in the
unformulated mass of one's life, in the substance of one's reality; it
means not feeling in oneself an enormous hole, a crucial absence; it
means always feeling one's thought equal to one's thought, however
inadequate the form one is able to give it. [<I>SW,</I> 70]
<!--_/extract--></blockquote>
<p>
A "living mind," he explains, is one that is "still conscious, lucid,
capable of observing and measuring its own life, capable, if necessary
and at certain moments, of weighing and judging its own thought"
(<I>SW,</I> 192).

<p>
Given this identification of thought with self-consciousness, this
conceptualization of thinking as a self-sustaining mode of
self-awareness, it is understandable that Artaud often attempted to
overcome the sense of nonbeing through compulsive attempts to
contemplate, control, or describe his own thinking. It was not enough,
it seems, for him to open his eyes and see; or, for that matter, to
close his eyes and think. To gain a feeling of ontological grounding,
experience had somehow to be registered, held fast, and seen twice.
Not only did Artaud need to see, he had to watch his own seeing; and
not only think, but contemplate his thoughts, constantly testing their
responsiveness to his will. Thus he explains that what constitutes
thought is not its external reference, accuracy, or transparency, but
some reflexive inner sense of its thereness and its myness: "for by
<I>having</I> <I>thought</I> I do not mean seeing correctly or even
<I>thinking</I> correctly; having thought to me means
<I>sustaining</I> one's thought, being able to manifest it to oneself"
(<I>SW,</I> 69). 

<p>
Artaud's writings of this period reflect intense self-preoccupation of
two kinds: on the one hand, anguished attempts to trace the fitful and
ultimately ineffable contents of his inner life; and, on the other,
equally anguished attempts to state the problem of ineffability
itself--to express precisely how it feels to be unable to express
oneself, and to explain how this inability undermined his literary
endeavours and provided him with his central theme. In such explicitly
introspective works as his correspondance with the editor Jacques
Rivi&egrave;re (1923-24) and the <I>Fragments of a Diary
</I> <b></b> <I>from Hell</I> , Artaud speaks of "persist[ing] in
this pursuit, in this need to pin down once and for all the state of
my suffocation": "I am definitively apart from life," he writes. "My
torment is as subtle and refined as it is bitter. It is necessary for
me to make insane efforts of the imagination, multiplied tenfold by
the grip of this 
strangling asphyxia, in order to succeed in <I>thinking</I> my
disease" (<I>SW,</I> 92). 

<p>
To capture precisely his own unique inner sensations, to pin down or
state his condition, to think his disease--to Artaud such acts of
effortful and controlled self-awareness seemed to offer the best
chance of shoring up his eroding self and world and of mastering the
linguistic forms that always seemed to dissolve on
approach.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 But inherent in this yearning is a vicious
paradox: the very self-consciousness by which Artaud tried to shore
things up appears, in fact, to have further exacerbated (and perhaps
all along contributed to) the fragmentation and collapse that
afflicted his thinking and language as well as his general sense of
existence. "Yes, my thought knows itself," writes Artaud in <I>The
Umbilicus of Limbo</I> , "and it now despairs of reaching
itself. It knows itself, by which I mean that it suspects itself; and
in any case it no longer feels itself" (<I>SW,</I> 69). Artaud
describes his mind as "present at the profound decline and
non-manifestation of its own powers"; his experience takes the form of
an "inner dialogue between consciousness and mind, that kind of
soliloquy to which everything is reduced and by which everything is
ultimately measured in the inner domain, which sees its words burst,
its phrases abort, its stability scattered, curiously undermined, full
of flight, full of a horrible suspended absence" (<I>SW,</I>
192-93).

<p>
Artaud's most explicit descriptions of this sort of mental
self-subversion can be found in his letters to the doctor George
Soulie de Morant. In 1932, when the Apollonian phase was nearly over
and he had already begun his essays on the theater of cruelty, Artaud
looks back over his past in an attempt "to illuminate once and for all
. . . the dominant characteristic" of the "horribly cruel" and nearly
ineffable 
condition that continues to plague him (<I>SW,</I> 290). The lack of
"continuity" or "persistence" in his thinking might, he writes,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
in some sense be regarded as analogous to the stammering which
possesses my outward elocution almost every time I want to speak. It
is as if each time my thought tries to manifest itself it contracts,
and it is this contraction that shuts off my thought from within,
makes it rigid as in a spasm; the thought, the expression stops
because the flow is too violent, because the brain wants to say too
many things which it thinks of all at once, ten thoughts instead of
one rush toward the exit . . . [<I>SW,</I> 293] 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
On reading this passage, it is natural to assume that Artaud's
thought-blocking or stammering is a consequence of his consciousness
being overly full, an assumption that is also consistent with two of
the most common characterizations of schizophrenic cognition: the
cognitivist notion that such individuals are overwhelmed by internal
and external stimuli due to their lack of an attentional gating
mechanism or filter capable of blocking out the irrelevant; and the
psychoanalytic notion of 
schizophrenic consciousness as dominated by wildly proliferating
primary-process <b></b> modes of thought. A bit later in the same letter,
however, Artaud rejects the idea that his consciousness is a
plenitude. As he explains, there is a more profound sense in which his
mind is too empty:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
[B]ut if one really analyzes a state of this kind it is not by being
too full that consciousness errs at these moments but by being too
empty, for this prolific and above all 
unstable and shifting juxtaposition is an illusion. Originally there
was no juxtaposition, for it seems that in every state of
consciousness there is always a dominant theme, and if the mind has
not <I>automatically</I> decided on a dominant theme it is through
weakness and because at that moment nothing dominated, nothing
presented itself with enough force or continuity in the field of
consciousness to be recorded. The truth is, therefore, that rather
than an overflow or an excess there was a deficiency; in the absence
of some precise thought that was able to develop, there was
slackening, confusion, fragility. [<I>SW,</I> 293]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Artaud also denies that the confusion besetting his thinking is the
product of a dominance of instinctual over rational processes. What is
impaired, he says, is "not merely the thought but the personality, the
life" (<I>SW,</I> 294). In the absence of vital impulse, there emerges
no charged purpose or idea around which the mind can spontaneously
organize itself. "Things have no more odor, no more sex," he writes in
<I>The Umbilicus of Limbo;</I> "their logical order is also sometimes
broken precisely because of their lack of emotional aroma" (<I>SW,</I>
65). "My thought can no longer go where my emotions and the images
that arise within me drive it. I feel castrated even in my slightest
impulses" (<I>SW,</I> 92).

<p>
It turns out, then, that Artaud's consciousness is not in fact filled
with mental 
contents--not, at least, with mental content of the usual kind. The
violent "flow" of which he speaks is composed neither of instinctual
urges nor of stimuli nor even of normal images or thoughts, but of
something more like meta-levels--perspectives on himself and his own
thinking. "[T]en thoughts instead of one rush toward the exit," he
says in the letter to George Soulie de Morant, then goes on to explain
what these thoughts actually involve:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
[T]he brain sees the whole thought at once with all its circumstances,
and it also sees all the points of view it could take and all the
forms with which it could invest them, a vast juxtaposition of
concepts, each of which seems more necessary and also more dubious
than the others, which all the complexities of syntax would never
suffice to express and expound. [<I>SW,</I> 293]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
What plagues Artaud is actually a form of maniacal, reflexive
self-awareness. Instead of simply grasping its own content and nothing
more, his mind tends to be occupied with levels of awareness that
would normally be known only by some other person who observes his
subjectivity from without. Indeed, he can become so preoccupied with
states of mind as such that there is hardly any interest, or any room,
left over for more standard kinds of mental contents. One consequence
is a destabilization and undermining of foundations; Artaud describes
himself as "losing contact with all <b></b> those first assumptions which
are at the foundation of thought." It is "this 
catastrophe at a higher level," he explains, that is "the destructive
element which demineralizes the mind and deprives it of its first
assumptions," thereby making "the ground under my thought crumble"
(<I>SW,</I> 290, 94):

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
It so happens that this slackening, this confusion, this fragility
express themselves in an infinite number of ways and correspond to an
infinite number of new impressions and sensations, the most
characteristic of which is a kind of disappearance or disintegration
or collapse of first assumptions which even causes me to wonder why,
for example, red (the color) is considered red and affects me as red,
why a judgment affects me as a judgment and not as a pain, why I feel
a pain, and why this particular pain, which I feel 
without understanding it . . . for after all there is no reason why
what is simply a 
perverse and perverted way of being and feeling should be the cause of
a state that makes me miserable. No doubt that idiotic and crude
reaction of people who, when confronted by someone else's pain, say,
Don't think about it, is right, but they are metaphysically right and
do not know it. [<I>SW,</I> 293-94]

<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
The Dionysian project central to Artaud's second period of writing
cannot be understood apart from the forms of experience that precede,
underlie, and in the end undermine it. This is not to say that such
texts as <I>The Theater and its Double,</I> Artaud's most exciting
work and his most significant contribution to esthetics, can be
dismissed as of no intrinsic interest. Still, it hardly requires a
deep committment to a hermeneutics of suspicion to recognize that
Artaud's advocacy of a theater of 
cruelty is something other than the "uncontrollable, polymorphous
movement of desire" imagined by certain champions of his
work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Artaud's own words virtually demand that we see his
ecstatic project as (at least in part) what one might call a Dionysian
defense (and a rather unsuccessful one) against what is essentially an
Apollonian or Socratic condition.

<p>
Ana&iuml;s Nin recounts a time when Artaud, leaving a cafe in an open
taxi, stood up, stretched out his arms toward the crowded street, and
said, "The revolution will come soon. All this will be destroyed. The
world must be destroyed. It is corrupt and full of ugliness. It is
full of mummies, I tell you. Roman decadence. Death. I wanted a
theater that would be like a shock treatment, galvanize, shock people
into 
feeling."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 In the preface to <I>The Theater and its
Double,</I> he writes of "the unprecedented number of crimes whose
perverse gratuitousness is explained only by our powerlessness to take
complete possession of life" (<I>TID,</I> 9). And in his essay on the
Balinese theater, he praises the frenzied dance in which "one suddenly
senses the headlong fall of the mind," and manages "to cover over the
void with fear" (<I>SW,</I> 225). 

<p>
True theater, Artaud believed, had to be a massive assault putting
"direct pressure on the senses" (<I>TID,</I> 125), an arousal of
instincts so extreme as to obliterate normal consciousness. Through a
Satanic "total exorcism" of intellect and superego, such a theater
would overwhelm all scruples and hesitations, all concern with
rational purpose, and any tendency to dote upon the future or any
other absent world. <b></b> Distantiated estheticism--that "hellish,
truly accursed thing in our time . . . our 
artistic dallying with forms"--should disappear, to be replaced by a
total theater that rivets the attention and eclipses all sense of
distance, a theater in which both actors and spectators become "like
victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames" (<I>TID,</I>
13). In this period Artaud no longer yearns for a private language, a
language adequate to the unique intricacies of his inner life, as he
had in the 1920s. He calls instead for a nondiscursive and alogical,
an affective and respiratory language: "a 
different language of nature . . . whose sources will be tapped at a
point still deeper, more remote from thought" (<I>TID,</I> 110), and
which will restore to speech "its old magic, its essential
spellbinding power" (<I>TID,</I> 111). No longer does he seek to know
and control his mind, for he now recognizes that "all true freedom is
dark, and infallibly identified with sexual freedom" (<I>TID,</I> 30).

<p>
Artaud's views on the theater of cruelty are well known, and I do not
wish to dwell upon them here. In many respects they are an attempt to
foster the kind of pure Dionysiac experience described in Nietzsche's
<I>Birth of Tragedy</I> (a book Artaud is likely to have read).
Consciousness--now understood not as the true source of being but as
the inclination to nihilate the world and feeling, to hold things off
at a 
distance--is Artaud's ever-present enemy during this period; its
obliteration is the central purpose of his new esthetic demands.
Artaud's attempts to instantiate such a theater were, in any case,
rather unsuccessful, both with audiences and as a curative medium for
Artaud himself. Artaud knew, however, of another way to pursue his
end. This was to return to what, in Nietzsche's view, is the true
origin of theater and the theatrical impulse: the orgiastic rituals of
primitive cultures, rituals where there is no audience but only
participants, where nothing is symbolized or represented because
everything is present, including even the deities and demons who will
seem quite 
literally brought down to earth. 

<p>
Artaud had long dreamed of cultures more primitive or more innocent:
of the ancient Syrians, the Europeans of the Middle Ages, and
contemporary tribal peoples, all of whom he imagined as pursuing the
mystic project of glimpsing "the great All." "Ever since the genesis
of the elements," he wrote, the ancient religions "neither separated
the sky from man, nor man from the entire creation" (<I>PWW,</I> 136).
Artaud yearned for an "organic culture" in which to drown his
increasing estrangement: "a culture based on the mind in relationship
to the organs, and the mind bathing in all the organs, and responding
to each of them at the same time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 After the devast-ating
failure of his play, <I>Les Cenci</I>, Artaud decided to leave Paris
and 
travel to a land where such a culture would really exist. He would go
to the Mexico of the Tarahumara, that "Primeval Race" of "pure red
Indians" who exist "in a 
feeling of spontaneous solidarity" in touch with the "natural
Unconscious"; people whose "magic culture . . . spring[s] forth from
the power of the Indian soil," who are "physically strong like Nature"
because they are "made of the same substance as nature" (<I>PD,</I>
3-11; <I>PWW,</I> 142).

<p>
Like the Surrealists and many others of his generation, Artaud
considered tribal man to be free of what Breton termed "the hegemony
of consciousness," and therefore <b></b> as able "to concentrate on the
conquest of revelatory emotions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 It is hardly surprising
that Artaud, an admirer of Breton and sometime member of the
Surrealist group, should have imbibed the evolutionist notions popular
in his own cultural milieu. More interesting, and more revealing of
Artaud's own preoccupations, is the shifting or contradictory quality
of his attitudes. The Tarahumara and other pagans and primitives of
Artaud's imagination are not, in fact, conceived in simple antithesis
to his own alienation and hyperreflexivity: though largely defined in
opposition to European consciousness as well as to his own inner
state, Artaud does not always imagine them as devoid of alienation so
much as, in effect, engaged in effortful 
struggle against it. "What distinguished the pagans from us," he
writes in one passage, "is that at the origin of all their beliefs
there is <I>a</I> <I>terrific</I> <I>effort</I> <I>not</I> <I>to</I>
<I>think</I> <I>as</I> <I>men,</I> in order to stay in contact with
the entire creation, that is, with the divinity" (<I>PWW,</I> 140;
emphasis added). At times, in fact, Artaud describes the Tarahumara as
living as if they were already dead, as obsessed with philosophy and
ideas, and as despising the life of their bodies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Like
Artaud himself, the Indians he imagines seem not to be spontaneous
primitives so much as willful ones, or better, primitiv<I>ists</I> who
have glimpsed the trajectory of human consciousness and now recoil
defensively from its demands. They exist, says Artaud, "in defiance of
this age" (<I>PD,</I> 7).

<p>
Artaud spent a number of months in Mexico City before he managed to
obtain financial support for a visit to the Tarahumara Indians, who
lived in the Sierra Madre mountains of northern Mexico. The trip began
ominously. Artaud was exhausted and in great physical pain. Among
other problems, he was withdrawing from drugs; 
wanting to rid himself of his European addictions, he had thrown away
the last of his heroin before entering the mountainous region. He
traveled on horseback into the back country, immersed in a
quasi-delusional mood in which everything in the landscape had a
doubled look--as if "represent[ing] an experience I had had before"
(<I>PD,</I> 84)--or seemed to be filled with an ineffable
portentousness: "The land of the Tarahumara is full of signs, forms,
and natural efes which in no way seem the result of chance"
(<I>SW,</I> 379).
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 

<p>
When he finally arrived among the Indians, Artaud was unable at first
to get them to perform their peyote rituals, and had to wait some
weeks in what felt like "heavy captivity." As so often before,
Artaud's body felt to him now like a "cataclysm" or a "dislocated
assemblage, [a] piece of damaged geology." For twenty-eight days, he
felt that "this ill-assembled heap of organs which I was and which I
had the impression of witnessing [was] like a vast landscape of ice on
the point of breaking up" (<I>SW,</I> 382-83). Not surprisingly,
Artaud was moved to doubt the worth of his pilgrimage and his
primitivism:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
For to have come this far, to find myself at last on the threshhold of
an encounter and of this place from which I expected so many
revelations, and to feel so lost, so 
abandoned, so deposed. . . . And all this, for what? For a dance, for
a rite of lost Indians who no longer even know who they are or where
they come from and who, when you question them, answer with tales
whose connection and secret they have lost. . . . And <b></b> what was it
then, what false presentiment, what illusory and artificial intuition
caused me to expect some sort of liberation for my body and also and
above all a force, an 
illumination throughout the reaches of my inner landscape, which I
felt at that precise minute to be beyond any kind of dimensions? . . .
Why this terrible sensation of loss, of a void to be filled, of an
event that miscarries? [<I>SW,</I> 384]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
But then, at last, the Indians did perform their ritual. As Artaud
watched, the priest-sorcerors began pounding the ground and tracing
magical numbers and 
symbols in the dirt. The dancers whirled, lacerating space with their
"coyote calls" and tinkling strange bells, while the priests uttered
incantations and sprinkled water on the initiates, striking their
heads with magical sticks (<I>PD,</I> 31). Artaud, who had taken
peyote, felt at moments that he was inside the ultimate theater of
cruelty. The Indians lay him on the ground "so that the ritual would
descend upon me, so that fire, litany, screams, dance and the night
itself like a living human vault might wheel as a living being over
me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 "To this I knew that my physical destiny was
irrevocably bound. I was ready for any burning, and I awaited the
first fruits of the fire in view of a conflagration that would soon be
universal" (<I>PD,</I> 57-58).

<p>
The experience was clearly ecstatic, but its impact, unfortunately,
was short-lived (<I>PD,</I> 82). Before long, Artaud's sense of cosmic
transformation seems to have turned negative, his sense of mystical
union undermined by an encroaching and all too familiar sense of
ontological insecurity and catastrophe. In <I>The New Revelations of
Being,</I> a pamphlet written shortly after his return to Europe,
Artaud predicts a cosmic holocaust, a destruction of civilization or
ruination brought on by Fire, Water, Earth, and by "a Star which will
occupy the entire surface of the air, in which the Spirit of Man had
been immersed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<p>
In other passages in <I>The New Revelations of Being,</I> Artaud comes
close to admitting the essentially reactive or defensive nature of his
Dionysian project, this attempt to cover the void with fear that now
seemed to him to have been doomed from the start: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
For a long time I have felt the Void, but I have refused to throw
myself into the 
Void. . . .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
When I believed that I was denying this world, I know now that I was
denying the Void. . . .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
What I have suffered from until now is having denied the Void.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The void which was already within me. [<I>SW, </I>413]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Now he prefers to accept rather than to t separation and nonbeing,
as if the only possible act of affirmation was the paradoxical one of
affirming nonbeing itself:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
I know that someone wanted to enlighten me by means of the Void and
that I refused to let myself be enlightened. . . .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I struggled to exist, to try to accept the forms (all the forms) with
which the delirious illusion of being in the world has clothed
reality. <b></b> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I no longer want to be one of the deluded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Dead to the world, to what composes the world for everyone else,
fallen at last, 
fallen, risen in this void which I was denying, I have a body which
suffers the world and disgorges reality. . . .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is a real Desperate Person who speaks to you and who has not known
the happiness of being in the world until now that he has left this
world, now that he is 
absolutely separated from it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The others who have died are not separated. They still turn around
their dead 
bodies.
</blockquote>

<p>
<I>The New Revelations of Being</I> was the last work Artaud completed
before breaking down into frank psychosis. Shortly after finishing it,
he embarked on a final 
desperate journey to Ireland, where he believed he was meant to await
the 
impending holocaust. The trip went badly; there were reports of
violent or threatening behavior; and on arriving back in France,
Artaud was in a straitjacket. It was the beginning of nine years of
confinement in mental hospitals.

<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
After his arrival at Le Havre in September 1937, Artaud was placed in
a series of mental hospitals. Following the acutely disturbed phase of
his trip to Ireland, he now lapsed into a state more characteristic of
chronic schizophrenia. For a year and a half he was nearly catatonic,
refusing to respond to visitors or write to his friends. On being
declared incurable, he was transferred, in February 1939, to a
hospital on the outskirts of Paris. There he began to write letters
and receive visitors, who were appalled to see what had happened to
their friend. After four years, Artaud was again transferred, this
time to an asylum in Rodez in southern France where he remained until
1946, when intercession by friends and admirers willing to guarantee
his 
financial support made possible his release and return to Paris. 

<p>
From the time of the ill-fated trip to Ireland, Artaud was frequently
preoccupied with grandiose and violent fantasies that had a more
overtly psychotic quality than did the eccentricities of his earlier
years. At Rodez, for example, he would frequently circle his room
uttering wild cries and, at meals, would sometimes engage in such
strange rituals as belching in rhythmic patterns or getting down on
his hands and knees to draw magic circles. At times he felt his body
was occupied by a succession of different souls, whose conversation he
was able to overhear; and he declared that all "things and
<I>beings</I> inevitably obey the commandment of my breath"
(<I>PWW,</I> 188).

<p>
In these last ten years of his life, Artaud continued to be plagued by
feelings of ontological insecurity and nonbeing. In letters written in
Rodez, for instance, he complains of horrible splittings of the
personality that make him "absolutely 
incapable of working, thinking, <I>and</I> <I>feeling</I> <I>that</I>
<I>I</I> <I>was</I> <I>alive"</I> (<I>SW,</I> 438). Though he blamed
these feelings on the electroshock treatments he received, they can,
in fact, be difficult to distinguish from those he had described so
often before, as in his early <b></b> texts, <I>The Umbilicus of
Limbo</I>  and <I>The Nerve Meter</I> . Artaud's
continuing sense of ontological insecurity, at the limit a fear of
world catastrophe, is 
apparent in his descriptions of van Gogh, an important alter-ego
re of this 
period. Artaud speaks of van Gogh as a man who "understood the
phenomenal nature of the problem," the fact that in him "every real
landscape is as if latent in the crucible where it is going to be
reborn" (<I>SW,</I> 505). The sense of cosmic or godlike
responsibility thereby implied was accompanied by feelings of
all-encompassing threat: van Gogh's paintings, says Artaud, are like
atomic bombs or bursts of fire <I>(SW,</I> 483); "the apocalypse, a
consummated apocalypse, is brooding right now in the paintings of old
martyred van Gogh," the artist who "has caught the moment when the
pupil is about to pour itself out in the void" (<I>SW,</I> 497, 510).
And, writes Artaud in 1947, "I am also like poor van Gogh. I no longer
think but each day I come nearer to the explosions I am
producing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>


<p>
At first glance, Artaud's third phase may well appear to perpetuate
and exaggerate his second phase, with its revulsion for consciousness
and its valorization of the body. In "Chiote &agrave; l'Esprit" (Shit
to the Mind), a poem written about a year before his death, he
declares:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
the mind is pretentious and phony.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of larval smoke which only lives upon 
what it has drawn out
from the body struggling to make a gesture and not an idea or fact.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For really, what are these ideas, facts, 
values and qualities? 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifeless terms which only become real when the 
body has sweated them out. [<I>PWW,</I> 166]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Now more than ever, Artaud believes in the redemptive power of bodily
being, and yearns for an existence in which "there is no inside, no
mind, no outside or consciousness, nothing but the body just as you
see it--a body whose existence doesn't cease even when the eye looking
at it turns away. And this body is a fact: me" (<I>PWW,</I>
168).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>


<p>
Unlike in the Dionysian phase, however, Artaud no longer looks to
instinct and desire, or to pleasure and pain, as offering refuge from
the deadening, distantiating tendencies of the mind. The following
passage is an implicit critique of the theater-of-cruelty aesthetic,
for it suggests that even the most intense physical sensations are now
vulnerable to consciousness's derealizing power: "When my hand burns,
/ there is the fact that my hand burns which, considered as a fact, is
already in trouble, / 
having the feeling that my hand is burning means entering another
domain. / If I have the idea that my hand burns, I am no longer in my
hand but in a state of supervision" (<I>PWW,</I> 167).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

Even basic biological facts have lost their incontrovertible,
anchoring power; and are now liable to feel like absurd phenomena,
arbitrary 
products of human will that might just as well not have existed, or
have existed in some very different form: "There where it smells of
shit / it smells of being. / Man could very well have avoided
shitting, / and kept his anal pocket closed, / but he chose <b></b> to
shit / like he could've chosen to live / instead of consenting to live
dead" (<I>WRS,</I> 291). 

<p>
But it is not merely that instinct and sensuality are
<I>vulnerable</I> to the depredations of consciousness; the Dionysian
realm now takes on certain of the ontological characteristics
previously associated with the realm of mind. Lust and all the other

imperatives of the flesh had previously been experienced as plenitude,
sources of a heightened sentiment of being. Now, like the mind, they
are felt to constitute an essential lack, aptly expressed through the
motif of the hole or the void. In "Le Visage Humain," an essay
published the year before his death, it is the organs of sense
perception, the bodily sites of intentional, world-directed
consciousness, that appear as grotesque voids: "But this means that
the human face as it is is still 
searching with two eyes, a nose, a mouth and four openings of the
burial vault of approaching death" (<I>WRS,</I> 277). In another work
from the same period, <I>Artaud le Momo,</I> desire is represented in
similar terms: thus Artaud describes the human body as: "This tongue
between four gums, / this meat between two knees, / this piece of hole
/ for madmen" (<I>SW,</I> 524). A passage from his radio play of 1947,
"To Have Done with the Judgment of God," describes human life as an
"electric battery"

<blockquote><!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose abilities and emphases
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been oriented toward sexual life
<BR>
while it is made
<BR>
precisely for absorbing
<BR>
by its voltaic displacements
<BR>
all the errant availabilities
<BR>
of the infinity of the void,
<BR>
of the increasingly incommensurable
<BR>
holes of void
<BR>
of a never fulfilled organic possibility. [<I>WRS,</I> 312]
<!--_/extract--></blockquote>
<p>
In contrast with his earlier polarizing of the sensual and the
cerebral, Artaud now sees the mental self as a parasite that corrupts
an otherwise self-sufficient and innocent body, transforming it into
an organ of desire: 

<blockquote><!--_extract-->
The anchored mind
<BR>
screwed into me
<BR>
by the psycho-lubricious
<BR>
thrust
<BR>
of heaven
<BR>
is the one that thinks
<BR>
every temptation
<BR>
every desire
<BR>
every inhibition. [<I>SW,</I> 523] 
<!--_/extract--></blockquote>

<p>
In his later years, Artaud was obsessed with thoughts of parasitic
beings bent on destroying him by sucking life from him, by robbing him
of his masculinity, as well <b></b> as by appealing to corporeal desires.
The essence of these "psycholascivious 
parasites" is the same as what, for Artaud, now characterizes both
consciousness and desire: namely, pure nothingness, a condition they
create and by which they are also created. Thus the parasites are
"born without cessation, / from each other, / from the holes of the
air, / from the roaming vacuities of space" (<I>PWW,</I>
181).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<p>
Since Artaud now believes that both "feelings and the mind have
poisoned life" (<I>PWW,</I> 167), he wants to cut off every sort of
connection with the external world, to be "chaste and pure, / virgin,
intact, untouchable" (<I>PWW,</I> 192):

<blockquote><!--_extract-->
there is no learning, no knowledge,
<BR>
life has been lost from the day that one single
<BR>
thing was known.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I am not of your world
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
mine is on the other side of everything that is, knows and is aware of
itself, desires and makes itself. [<I>PWW,</I> 165]
<!--_/extract--></blockquote>

<p>
The body he now wishes to become is a purified body, a "body without
organs." The psycholascivious parasites are dependent creatures who
corrupt by inducing the dependencies of desire. To evade their
corrupting influence it is necessary that all holes be covered over
and all organs extirpated--those of consciousness as well as of
instinct, eyes and ears as well as genitals, anus, and mouth. At the
end of "To Have Done with the Judgment of God," Artaud dreams of an
operation on an "autopsy table" in which all the organs of the human
body are removed:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
When you will have made [Man] a body without organs, 
<BR>
then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions 
<BR>
and restored him to his true freedom. [<I>SW,</I> 571]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
In his attempt to remove everything that might evoke any hint of
ontological dependency, or of the absence and nonbeing this now
implies, Artaud was forced to deny virtually every conceivable form of
sapient or sensate human existence: "I hate and denounce as a coward
all sensations and all being. / I hate and denounce the so-called
sensations of being. / I am by nature clean and pure" (<I>PWW,</I>
192). What Artaud desires in this final year of his life is a
paradoxical and impossible state: to <I>be</I> the kind of being that
has no sensation of being, and, at the same time, to experience this
condition. He wants to return to a time before mind existed, a time
when, "as for consciousness, no one had ever thought of it"
(<I>SW,</I> 505). Thus he wants to create a theater very different
from that of <I>The Theater and its Double,</I> a theater in which man
would be a "sculptural object" rather than a "swollen creature"; and
he insists that Man could, indeed should, have made up his mind "to
lose being, that is, to die alive" (<I>SW, </I>559).
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 

<p>
The state of grace that Artaud now imagines is antithetical to that of
the psycholascivious parasites: devoid as it is not only of all need
for ingestion, excretion, or <b></b> desire, but also of any
consciousness of the ambient world. Now his great wish is to become
"an old tree with grooves / which didn't eat / didn't drink / didn't
breathe" (<I>PWW,</I> 182); and he dreams of an idyllic golden age, a
time

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
when man was a tree without organs or function, but possessed of will,
[this time] will return. For the great lie has been to make man an
organism, / ingestion, / assimilation, / incubation, / excretion, /
thus creating a whole order of hidden functions which are outside /
the realm of the <I>deliberative</I> will; / the will that determines
itself at each instant; for it was this, that human tree that walks, /
a will that determines itself at each instant, / without functions
that were hidden, underlying, governed <I>by</I> <I>the</I>
<I>unconscious.</I> [<I>SW,</I> 515]
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
The pure will of this "tree without organs or functions" is not that
of "digestive humanity" (<I>SW,</I> 519). It is an uncontaminated,
self-determining, utterly independent will, a will that is conscious
through and through, and free of any determination by underlying
motives. It is the will of a creature supreme in its indifference and 
harboring no desire other than the wish to constitute itself beyond
any risk of neediness or nonbeing. 

<p>
Artaud's body without organs is obviously not a Dionysian body. It is
also different from the synthesis inherent in a romantic or Hegelian
unification of body with soul, mind with universe, self with other, or
a Nietzschean union of the Apollonian and Dionysian principles. To
reconcile the psychical with the physical in the form of the organic
would, for Artaud, be tantamount to creating a psycholascivious
parasite, the loathsome creature who combines the dependencies
inherent in both knowing mind and yearning body. Artaud's "body
without organs," his "tree without organs or 
function," implies a strange coming-together of spirit and
substance--a denaturing of both mind and body in which each element is
purified to a point of self-negation that is also a point of
convergence between the two. As we have seen, the body 
without organs is a body without desire and sentience, almost a mere
substance. In one sense, then, it might be seen as the final stage in
an anti-Hegelian progression whereby Artaud passes from
self-consciousness back through the imperatives of passion and pain,
and on toward states of vegetal or even inorganic matter. In another
way, however, it can seem a return to the condition of his first,
highly cerebral phase. Artaud's body without organs is, after all, a
pure and worldless will--self-determining, self-identical, and
self-aware. If it is a body, it is a curiously Apollonian one. If it
is a synthesis, it is one founded on negation rather than
reconciliation: all the 
elements are there, but denied rather than affirmed. The body without
organs of this supposed champion of unbridled passion is not, then, a
bodymind but a not-body / not-mind, apotheosis of pure negation.

such a state occurs, they claim, it is not the result of the
schizophrenic process itself but rather of its interruption, whether
through incarceration or through the deadening effect of a society
that recoils from those who threaten it. The re of Artaud lies
behind their image of schizophrenia as a state hyper-imbued with
passion and the life force.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT9" HREF="#REF9">9</a>.
It goes without saying that I adopt the terms Apollonian and
Dionysian from Nietzsche's <I>Birth of Tragedy.</I> My purpose here is
to capture the dominant and distinctive features of each of these
three phases, and thereby to bring out the main lines of Artaud's
psychological and esthetic development. I recognize that, in doing so,
I exaggerate somewhat the unity of Artaud's concerns in each period:
there is more heterogeneity within, and more overlap between, these
periods than is reflected in my presentation. I am indebted to various
works on Artaud's life and work, including Martin Esslin, <I>Antonin
Artaud;</I> Ronald Hayman, <I>Artaud and After</I> (Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 1977); Bettina Knapp, <I>Antonin Artaud: Man of

Greene, <I>Antonin Artaud.</I>

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT10" HREF="#REF10">10</a>.
Andr&eacute; Breton, more clear-sighted than many of Artaud's
devotees, once described Artaud as having led him to a place that was
"abstract, a gallery of ice . . . a place of lacunae and ellipses
where personally I could no longer communicate with the innumerable
things I like" (quoted in Greene, <I>PWW,</I> 23). Artaud himself once
wrote that what made him different from the Surrealists was the fact
that he despised life as much as they loved it (<I>PWW,</I> 23).

<p>

Artaud could be said to yearn for a "private language," in
Wittgenstein's sense of the phrase. See Louis Sass, "Antonin Artaud,
Modernism, and the Yearning for a Private Language," in Kjell S.

See <I>PD,</I> 3, 9, 10. Later, when the trip was over, Artaud
would recall a conversation with the Tarahumara priest who gave him
peyote. The priest had described his own world in terms reminiscent of
decadent, alienated Europe. "The world in the beginning was completely
real," Artaud reports him as saying. "It resounded in the human heart
and with the human heart. Now the heart is no longer in it, nor is the
soul because God has withdrawn from it" (<I>PD,</I> 34).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT17" HREF="#REF17">17</a>.
Even the number of times Artaud perceived certain forms in shadows
and rock formations seemed significant: "I saw repeated eight times
the same rock which projected two shadows on the ground. . . . And
everything I saw seemed to correspond to a number" (<I>SW,</I>
380-81). He looked about him with the kind of scrutiny that
forces the object to yield up some special yet elusive meaning: "I
noticed in the mountain that it is useful to have <I>the</I>
<I>obsession</I> <I>of</I> <I>counting.</I> There was not a shadow
that I did not count, when I felt it creep around something; and it
was often by adding up shadows that I found my way back to strange
centers." For discussion of this sort of predelusional mood, see Sass,

"The self is not the body, it is the body that is the self," wrote
Artaud in 1946-47 (<I>WRS,</I> 251). In a letter from 1948,
Artaud speaks of 

<p><blockquote><!--_extract-->
a nauseating flocculation of the infectious life of being
<BR>
which the PURE BODY
<BR>
repulses
<BR>
but which
<BR>
the PURE SPIRIT
<BR>
accepts
<BR>
and which the Mass
<BR>
through its rites brings about. . . .
<BR>
But this is what popular consciousness will never understand,
<BR>
that a macerated and trampled body . . .
<BR>
will be superior to a spirit handed over to all the phantasms of the
interior life
<BR>
which is merely the leaven
<BR>
and the seed
<BR>
for all the stinking phantasmagorical bestializations. [<I>WRS,</I>
330]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>
<p>
<a NAME="FOOT22" HREF="#REF22">22</a>.
This sense of derealization was a persistent fear even during
Artaud's Dionysian phase. In the preface to <I>The Theater and its
Double,</I> he writes, "If our life lacks brimstone, i.e., a constant
magic, it is because we choose to observe our acts and lose ourselves
in considerations of their imagined form instead of being impelled by
their force" (<I>TID,</I> 8). Artaud's comments on his play <I>Les
Cenci</I> make a related point: "There will be between the Theater of
Cruelty and <I>The Cenci</I> the difference which exists between the
roaring of a waterfall or the unleashing of a natural storm, and all
that remains of their violence once it has been recorded in an image"
(quoted in Stephen Barber, <I>Antonin Artaud: Blows and Bombs</I>
[London: Faber and Faber, 1993], 70).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT23" HREF="#REF23">23</a>.
In "To Have Done with the Judgment of God," Artaud speaks of "the
void which advances with all its forms / of which the most perfect
representation / is the march of an incalculable group of crab lice."
To the question, "And what exactly is consciousness?" he answers, "It
is nothingness. . . . It seems that consciousness / is in us / linked
/ to sexual desire / and hunger" (<I>WRS,</I> 294, 297-98).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT24" HREF="#REF24">24</a>.
Artaud's attitude toward language in his final period partakes of
this same paradoxicality: at times he advocated a language that seems
totally devoid of meaning, incomprehensible to everyone, the self
included. It appears that Artaud had arrived at a point where, at
moments, only utter eschewal of meaning, complete opacity of language,
could ward off the nihilating potentiality of human awareness and
proclaim a bedrock of existence independent of consciousness's
nihilating power. In the following poem he shifts from the theme of
ontological suffering toward the undeniable reality of sound, of pure
word-objects utterly devoid of sense: " . . .therefore no more
suffering. / no more illness / dysentery / suffocation . . . / ka
loughin / re te ka la gouda / ka lagouda / e te ka loughin"
(<I>PWW,</I> 213). Just as the body had to be rid of consciousness and
desire, of anything that points or yearns beyond itself, so language
had to be rid of any tendency for the signifier to refer to a distant

<P>
I find it hard not to see this event as an inversion of the story of the
three little pigs: here the three of us huff
and puff to blow down the house of the big bad wolf. This pig thought he
had a clever way to accomplish that. If I
could agree entirely with Walter Benn Michaels there would be no remainder
that his brilliant dialectics might subsume:
his house would stand but have no visitors. But despite my deep admiration
for his intricate arguments and my reluctant
concessions to his accounts of cultural pluralism and nativist modernism,
I cannot agree with the historical dimensions
of Michaels's argument. Even if one grants that there is a nativist
modernism, I doubt that it had the clear general
dominance that Michaels seems to be arguing for most of the time. And,
more important, I think his attributing such a
single synthetic identity across various cultural domains ignores the
various efforts to negotiate complex tensions
among value systems that are for me the central, dynamic features of
modernity. So I will have to make a few historical
claims and then try to explain what I find problematic in the theoretical
assumptions that seem to underlie Michaels's
argument.

<P>
Let me elaborate my complaint about his claims for the dominance of
nativist modernism by briefly addressing two
issues: first, problems in the scope of his claims and, second, problems
in how he deals with the agency of authors in
his efforts to establish that scope. On scope, consider the following
passage:


<B></B>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Johnson Act guaranteed that aliens would not become citizens by
putting a halt to mass immigration; the Citizenship
Act guaranteed that Indians would not become citizens by declaring that
they already were citizens. Both acts, that is,
participated in a recasting of American citizenship, changing it from a
status that could be achieved through one's own
actions (immigrating, becoming "civilized," getting "naturalized") to a
status that could better be understood as
inherited. [<I>OA,</I> 32]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A series of brilliant leaps here establishes a forceful account of how
ideas of citizenship changed for some agents.
But what about those who were not immigrants, and hence who already
experienced citizenship as inherited even (or
especially) during ages of heavy immigration? Conversely, what about those
immigrants who had received citizenship, or
whose children had heard stories about that process? Would they now shift
their understanding? And how much in common
really is there between the groups of immigrants and American Indians,
since they held quite different understandings
of what citizenship did and did not afford in economic and cultural terms?
Moreover, the very effort to establish
commonness on the level of what these pieces of legislation meant for
people requires overlooking the economic factors
that are central in establishing different experiences of
citizenship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 So as we pull at the threads of such
assertions we find neat equations unravelling into problematic
equivocations, and we begin to appreciate how many
factors an analysis of general attitudes toward citizenship might have to
account for.

<P>
Such omissions become more troubling when we turn to Michaels's dealings
with specific authors. He is superb in showing
how William Carlos Williams and Hart Crane enter into a discourse of
nativist modernism quite different from the
transnational modernism maintained by exiles like Ezra Pound and T. S.
Eliot. But I wonder how much these writers
ultimately share with the overall political concerns Michaels foregrounds.
If, for example, Williams insists that to be
"'Indianlike' the writer must make no likeness to Indians, he must devote
himself to 'WRITING'" (<I>OA,</I> 85), then
it seems that Williams's nativism is of a distinctly metaphoric kind, more
involved with the republic of letters than
with actual citizenship. To insist on the politics of his metaphors is not
far from calling for a feline modernism on
the basis of the analogies Williams draws between cats and the artist's
constructive intelligence. Michaels could only
be convincing here if he could show that Williams based specific political
decisions on identifications with the
natives he uses so blithely in his analogies. More important, Michaels
argues that texts can "parody but also
reproduce" (<I>OA,</I> 26) nativist attitudes, but he does not go on to
explore the aspects within the culture that
generate the distance necessary for parody. So he can use Jason Compson's
speeches as illustrations of William
Faulkner's dependency on racialist rhetoric (<I>OA,</I> 9). But in so
doing he ignores Faulkner's need to distance
himself from anything Compson-like (precisely because the author knows how
much he is tempted to such identifications).
Faulkner's own stance on race is probably closer to a tragic or Calvinist
inversion of progressivist racism that
becomes evident in the necessary deaths of Joe Christmas and Charles Bon,
as well as of Quentin Compson. Moreover, even
if I am wrong about Faulkner's specific beliefs, the gulf between Faulkner
and his characters


<B></B>


requires us to
postulate within modernist culture more than one attitude toward these
racial matters so that one can foreground the
tensions from which these doublings emerge.

<P>
Where conflict and uncertainty should be, Michaels doggedly and
brilliantly imposes a single dominant set of beliefs.
From my perspective the greatest cost is the resulting picture of
modernism. It simply does not suffice to equate
modernist styles with the purity of the signifier without also tracing the
ways that the artists and painters sought to
make this emphasis on syntax carry various versions of semantic force.
Think how often Williams speaks of realization
and of bearing cultural testimony, and recall the power of his lineation
to transform perception into C&eacute;zannian
realization by embodying the role of mental energies in the emergence of
sharp phenomenological detail. Similarly, when
Michaels links his claims about purity of the signifier to the ideal of
untranslatability, he ignores the degree to
which untranslatability functioned within modernism simply as a way of
opposing not impurity but discursivity. Indeed,
an impure art like collage might provide the best version of
untranslatability because of the diversity it forced into
conjunction. Finally, we have to recognize the profound impurities that
make it misleading to treat the literature of
the period in terms of simple dichotomies between native and universal.
Much of the energy driving the Harlem
Renaissance emerged from the pressure of having to face fundamental
conflicts between the ideals of a writing
distinctive to race and of a writing that explored cultural resources not
available to strict identifications with
nativist values.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 And while Williams insisted on the primacy of
the local (often as access to a universal),
even his most radical claims about American identity are accompanied by
statements about the need to use the kind of
singularity that artworks achieve to break down differences and weaken
partiality. So when Williams describes, as
Michaels puts it, "the success of a poem" as consisting in "its
achievement of identity" (<I>OA,</I> 83), he is in
entire sympathy with Pound's transnational modernist dreams that the
achieved identity of artworks can establish
energies then available for diverse cultural groups.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
Given Michaels's intricate mind, I have to risk being patronizing in order
to speculate on what theoretical assumptions
underlie his case; then I can try alternative ways of addressing the same
concerns, which here I will confine to
concepts of identity and of cultural heritage. As long as he is concerned
with transnational modernism, Michaels seems
to have no problem dealing with fluid identities and allowing claims about
culture to do work even though they are not
attached to race. But when he turns to the domestic American scene, the
standards seem to shift. Here his project of
"work[ing] out the meaning of the commitment to identity--linguistic,
national, cultural, racial" (<I>OA,</I>
3)--common to both the social and the aesthetic models of nativist
modernism depends on Michaels showing that such
commitments are inherently flawed by a version of what Kenneth Burke
called "the paradox of substance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

There is a basic contradiction "between being something and trying to be
the thing one is" (<I>OA,</I> 90), so that
concepts of racial and cultural identity compose a


<B></B>


slippery circuit
in which each supplements and empties the
other. Problematic notions of identity then seem inseparable from
problematic notions of cultural heritage: "For racial
identity to become a project, it must turn to culture; for cultural
identity to become a project it must turn to race"
(<I>OA,</I> 122; for fuller statement see 14-15).

<P>
In short, such identity-commitments lead to the dead end of contemporary
cultural pluralism. But are these the only
ways to think about identity--either as a basic practical concern or as a
specific theme in modernist thinking? If we
are to have a less thematizable history and a more intricate sense of how
agents encounter and deal with cultural
pressures, we have to explore both historical and theoretical ways of
negotiating identity claims that do not depend on
the ontological substrates responsible for the slippage so dear to
Michaels's heart. Suppose for example that claims
about personal identity can function as projections that take place on
many levels. Identity is not a condition that
need apply <I>tout court</I> in ways that require a language of grounding
substance. Rather, identity claims wield that
marvelous adjusting operator "as," and hence are relative to contextual
frames. Therefore assertions of identity have
varying degrees of comprehensiveness depending on the scope of
self-reference called for by the situation--my identity
as a tennis player may be more intense than my identity as a family man,
but it still addresses a much smaller set of
features of my life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
Once our sense of identity claims is reconred, we can then see how one
might provide an alternative to Michaels's
treatment of claims about cultural heritage. He sees these as at best
misleading, at worst as charlatanry because for
him such claims have to depend on attributions of shared substance for
those who belong to the culture, and hence they
sustain racism:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
The real question, however, is not which past should count as ours but why
<I>any </I>past should count as ours.
Virtually all the events and actions that we study did not happen to us
and were not done by us. In this sense, the
history we study is never our own; it is always the history of people who
were in some respects like us and in other
respects different. When, however, we claim it as ours, we commit
ourselves to the ontology of "the Negro," to the
identity of "we" and "they" and the primacy of race.
<BR>
<BR>
This is not to say . . . that all accounts of cultural identity
require a racial component, it is only to say
that the accounts of cultural identity that do any work require a racial
component. For insofar as our culture remains
nothing more than what we do and believe, it is impotently descriptive.
The fact, in other words, that something
belongs to our culture cannot count as a motive for our doing it since, if
it <I>does </I>belong to our culture, we
<I>already </I>do it and if we don't do it (if we've stopped or haven't
yet started doing it), it doesn't belong to our
culture. (It makes no sense, for example, to claim that we shouldn't teach
Shakespeare because he isn't part of our
culture since to teach him will immediately <I>make </I>him part of our
culture, but it also makes no sense to claim
that we should teach him because he is part of our culture since, if we
stop teaching him, he won't be any longer.)
[<I>OA,</I> 128]

<P>
If, however, one has a more supple view of both identity and the kinds of
pressures that ideals of a cultural heritage
can help negotiate, one need not be as fearful as


<B></B>


Michaels is of the
illusions of substance creeping in. There are
other ways to speculate on which history ought to be ours, ways that do
not generate a strict binary between something
belonging to our culture only because we do it and some netherworld of our
forgettings. To dramatize this alternative
we need only ask whether Michaels's version of culture will suffice for
the many first-person plurals invoked in the
passage just quoted. Can the "we" here do any work despite not alluding to
race? And must "our culture" here depend on
actual shared practices, or only on understanding what such practices
might look like, even if we do not now actualize
them? I suggest that the "we" invoked here does not depend on any specific
set of shared beliefs but only on shareable
competencies. That is so, I further contend, because a cultural heritage
makes better sense when viewed not as actual
concrete practices that are either present or absent, but as complex
grammatical competence: the ability to use certain
practices and make certain identifications and assertions of difference
when occasions call for them. And then the test
of belonging to the culture is not sharing any origin but being able to
share the kind of projections Michaels invites
us to take on. Sharing a cultural heritage does not necessarily mean
reading Shakespeare but it does mean understanding
the reasoning involved in making a case for reading Shakespeare. One might
even say that so long as we teach literature
or drama there are claims that anyone whose interests are directed toward
such materials will profit from trying
Shakespeare--not because there is some direct link to him but because
there are possible uses for him that emerge from
our grasp of related materials and the interests they may form. So there
are considerable grounds for inviting or even
requiring people to try out identifications with a heritage even if there
is no racial basis for the identification.
Culture as educational heritage belongs to us, in other words, not because
we have direct rights to it but because we
can visualize sufficient proximity to its projections that we can believe
we have some interests in trying on what it
offers.

<P>
For American modernism, shifting our theoretical terms also involves
shifting the level of issues we make central and
the range of sympathies we entertain--for example in relation to how
agents like Coolidge might have been using notions
of culture very differently from how Michaels reads them (<I>OA,</I> 35,
123) and in relation to appreciating why there
could have been such tension between universalist and particularist
stances on matters of race and culture. Moreover,
understanding that ideals of culture as <I>paideia</I> offered an
alternative to racial and class identifications seems
to me necessary to appreciate both how the children of immigrants were
educated into American and how at least many of
the intellectuals found grounds for breaking with the religious and family
ties that originally bound immigrant
communities. The parents' concern with getting educated in order to get
ahead made possible the children's concern for
education in order to get away.

<P>
An adequate sense of history also requires a sense of how we might alter
what we inherit. Acutely aware of this task,
Michaels tries to make visible both the lineage and the contradictory
structure of cultural pluralism. But for me the
ultimate limitation of the theoretical assumptions enabling his work is
their incapacity to be much help


<B></B>


in
suggesting any alternative practical strategies for reconring our
imaginations in relation to racial issues. For
Michaels's pragmatism this theoretical poverty is no weakness at all: in
theoretical poverty there may be existential
possibility. However, I do not see how productive possibility will emerge
from the binary in his work between
problematic strict notions of identity and some general sense that we can
do without the notion of identity entirely
(even though Michaels's own history seems driven by quite narrow
categories). In my view, the best way to counter the
heritage of nativist modernism is not to absolutize it and then demolish
it but to use the conflicts and tensions its
formation created in order to clarify just how complex identity issues
are, and just what moral and social work can be
done if one keeps a relativized sense of how identity claims are both
imposed and negotiated. Then we need not dismiss
the possible need for racial identifications, so long as we can also
promise corollary identifications with imaginative
sites not necessarily bound to any specific racial heritage. So long as
race remains a term validated by historical
patterns, there will have to be projections of imaginative ways for
identifying with others who feel they share or are
required to share similar histories. Developing these possible
imaginations is the work of culture. But once we
understand the relation between culture and identity we also have strong
grounds for arguing that it is as impoverished
to rely only on racial identifications as it is to deny by abstract
argument that they ought to matter for historical
practice.

There is one particular moment in <I>Our America</I> where this refusalof
economic factors in favor of cultural
concerns seems especially problematic. Michaels professes to find no merit
in the charge that whites have stolen
aspects of black culture, since there is no clear way to decide what makes
certain elements black or white:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
But why does white men's learning to sing and dance like blacks count as
stealing black culture? The assumption that
transforms learning into stealing must be that blacks have a <I>right
</I>to their culture that is violated by whites
who take up black cultural practices. Or, to look at it from the other
perspective, that whites who sing and dance like
blacks are betraying <I>their </I>culture. But for either of these
descriptions to be true there must be some special
relation between race and culture such that racial identity counts as
importantly determining cultural identity, that
is, as determining the cultural practices that you have a right to if not
necessarily the cultural practices you in
fact engage in. [<I>OA, </I>129]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
However in the case of claims about popular music at least, the charge is
not made on the basis of some abstract sense
of cultural right. Rather it is a simple economic fact that music
producers sought whites to play songs and develop
sounds that were the province of specific black performers. And the
outrage is a matter of profits going to those who
take the work of others: the fact that the work is black is much less
important than that the workers were perceived as
black and because of that were not the ones white promoters developed.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT2" HREF="#REF2">2</a>.
Clearly poets like Countee Cullen would not accept the statement that"the
alternative to 'Nigger' . . . seems to be
'imitation white'" (<I>OA,</I> 90). And Michaels needs his best
equivocating skills to get Alain Locke's concern for
what Locke calls "Negro life's" "seizing upon its first chances for group
expression and self-determination" to be
incompatible with Locke's corollary insistence that it is "unjust" and
"ridiculous . . . to regard and treat the Negro
<I>en masse</I>" (<I>OA,</I> 88). Given Locke's pragmatism, there can be
infinite ways that one can call upon a racial
group without treating that group in terms of a single mass: all they need
have in common is the possibility of seizing
in the present on new possibilities of individual self-expression.

Conversely this model will also accommodate treatments of identity
as"something that might be lost or found,
defended or surrendered" (<I>OA,</I> 141), since an utterance like "I am
Duchess of Malfi still" can be treated as a
taking of responsibility, not a discovery of something hidden. I use this
example to suggest also that it is
historically inaccurate to blame nativist modernism for making identity
into "an object of cathexis" (<I>OA,</I> 141),
since from the Renaissance to Hegel's beautiful soul such staking of the
self has been fundamental to Western drama,
and not only on stage. For a defense of the claims I make here see my
<I>Subjective Agency</I> (Oxford: Blackwell,
1994).

Speaking in Buffalo in 1994, the Argentinean poet Jorge Santiago Perednik
ended his talk on cultural resistance to the recent reign of terror in his
country by saying "the struggle is impossible and for that reason it took
place."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Without wanting to violate the cultural specificity of
Perednik's comment, I understand this also to mean that poetry, insofar as
it resists reification as culturally sanctioned Poetry, is also
impossible--and for that reason takes place. For the sake of this context,
I would like to add America to this list, for America is impossible and
for this reason, also, it exists.

<P>
Or Americas, for it is in the resistance to any singular unity of identity
that the impossibility of America, of a Poetics of the Americas, may be
said to dwell. The cultural space of this impossible America is not carved
up by national borders or language borders but transected by innumerable
overlaying, contradictory or polydictory, traditions and proclivities and
histories and regions and peoples and circumstances and identities and
families and collectivities and dissolutions--dialects and ideolects, not
National Tongues; localities and habitations, not States.

<P>
But such an America is imaginary, for everywhere the local is under fire
from the imposed standard of a transnational consumer culture and
undermined by the imperative to extract it and export it as product.

<P>
In the United States we are particularly bedeviled by our own history of
cultural resistance, often confusing the struggles for cultural
legitimation of the last century with our own reversed roles in this one.
I am thinking of the specific needs, a century ago, that gave rise to the
invention of "American





literature" as an academic category within
the university system that had only recently countenanced English, or
British, literature as a suitable appendix to the study of the classics
(primarily Greek and Roman works). At that time, there was a clear
necessity for breaking away from the perceived limitations of "Island"
English literature in order to build an audience for, and give a measure
of respectability and legitimation to, certain New England and
"middle-Atlantic" and southern English-language texts. "American" in this
context was a strategic rather than an essential category; as a result,
the multi-ethnic and polylinguistic reality of the U. S. was not accented
in early formations of "American literature." By 1925, William Carlos
Williams, in <I>In the American Grain, </I>had given new breadth to the
concept of America; yet his related insistence on an American speech
suggested a false essence to a concept useful only as a negation: NOT
English verse diction. That is, as a negative category American literature
was a useful hypothesis. In contrast, for the present, the idea of
American literature understood as a positive, expressive "totalization"
needs to continue to be dismantled.

<P>
The problem here is twofold: the totalization of "America" and the
globally dominant position of the U. S. Since the U. S. is the dominant
English language (as well as Western) nation in the political, economic,
and mass-cultural spheres, its monopolizing powers need to be
cracked--from the inside and outside--as surely as one version of
England's grip on our language's literature needed to be loosened in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The same logic that led to the
invention of American, as distinct from English, literature now leads to
the invention of, on the one hand, a non-American-centered
English-language literature and, on the other, a poetics of the Americas.
Any unitary concept of America is an affront to the multiplicity of
Americas that makes U. S. culture as vital as it is. America is, to echo
Perednik, an "unclassifiable" totality ("PCR"). For there is no one
America. The U. S. is less a melting pot than a simultaneity of
inconsolable coexistences--from the all-too-audible spokespeople of the
state to the ghostly voices of the almost lost languages of the sovereign
nations of Arapaho, Mohawk, Shoshone, Pawnee, Pueblo, Navaho, Crow, Cree,
Kickapoo, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Zuni . . . though in truth there are no
sovereigns, only sojourners.

<P>
For writing, or reading, to assume--and consequently "express" or
"project"--a national identity is as problematic as for writing to assume
a self or group identity. However, in jettisoning such presumptions, some
sense of what such entities might be may be revealed. Such exploratory
writing does not escape from its sociohistorical situation but instead
contributes to an interrogation and reformulation of the<I>description
</I>of that sociohistorical situation, foregrounding heterogeneous and
anomalous elements rather than homogenizing ones. In contrast, attempts to
represent an already constituted idea of identity may preclude the
possibility of encountering newly emerging identity formations.

<P>
I feel much closer to the concerns of some small-press magazines in the U.
K., Canada, New Zealand, and Australia than to most poetry magazines in
the U. S. As


<B></B>


 for the Americas, I would say that <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
</I>and <I>XUL, </I>the Argentinian magazine with which Perednik is
associated, probably share more than <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E </I>shared with
most other poetry magazines published in New York.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The
national focus of "American poetry" tends to encamp poets who would do
better to share work and readership; similarly, it tends to limit
arbitrarily the horizons of much current criticism of poetry. At the same
time, "internationalism," like its Anglophonic cousin the
"trans-Atlantic," has provided models of connoisseurship that have removed
poems from the local contexts that give them meaning while at the same
time developing a canon of works that undervalues the untranslatable
particularities not only of given poems but also of the selection of
poets. (A related problem of decontextualization is apparent in the
reception of "Latin American" fiction in the U. S.) Perednik speaks of the
serendipitous colliding of different poetries as the "law of poetic
coincidence" ("PCR"); this poetic law provides a way to navigate between
the universalizing humanisms of internationalism and the parochialism of
regionalism and nationalism.

<P>
This is not to say that our different national and cultural circumstances
are not marked in our poems; on the contrary, it is the insistence on
registering these social circumferences in the forms of our poems that may
be our shared methodological approach. I am also conscious that U. S.
poets tend to be less aware of developments in other English-writing
countries than the other way around. Often, our boasting about the
significance of a non-European American poetry has deafened us to the
newness of English-language poetries and non-English-language poetries
even further from Europe than our own, including some being written right
in the heart of that "old" world.

<P>
The impossible poetics of the Americas does not seek a literature that
unifies us as one national or even continental culture--America (the U.
S.), North America (the U. S. and Anglophonic Canada), Multicultural North
America (Canada, Mexico, and the U. S.), Latin America (south of the U.
S.), South America (the seventh continent, since in the U. S. we learn
that the Americas are two separate continents). Rather, the impossible
poetics of the Americas insists that our commonness is in our partiality
and disregard for the norm, the standard, the overarching, the universal.
Such poetry will always be despised by those who wish to use literature to
foster identification rather than to explore it.

<P>
So I hope it will be apparent that while I welcome the challenge of
multiculturalism as it has entered U. S. arts and education in the past
decade, I continue to find many of its proponents more interested in
reinforcing traditional modes of representation than allowing the
heterogeneity of forms and peoples that make up the cultural diversity of
the Americas to transform poetic styles and personal and group identities.
Yet it is hardly surprising that static conceptions of group identity
represented by authentic spokespersons continue to ride roughshod over
works and individuals whose identities are complex, multiple, mixed,
confused, hyperactivated, miscegenated, synthetic, mutant, forming, or
virtual.


<B></B>

<P>
American literary multiculturalism, insofar as it seeks to promote
representative res, runs the risk of becoming a kind of domestic
internationalism. When we seek representativeness from a poet we often do
so at the cost of misrepresenting the poem. At the same time, official
verse culture remains dominated by a poetics of individuality and
subjectivity that has tried to remain resistant to (not to say "above")
not only questions of identity politics but also aesthetic position, a
double evasion often expressed, apparently without irony, as
"disaffiliation." The result is an homogenization of poetic values and
practices undreamt of among poets willing to acknowledge their
affiliations.

<P>
The problem is how to pursue affinities while resisting unities and how to
resist unities without losing the capacity to be poetically responsible,
that is, responsive to and supportive of those poetic tendencies and
affiliations that deepen, intensify, and extend the activity of poetry.
And that means enacting poetry's contemporaneity--the willingness of poets
and ability of poems to act on and in the present social and cultural
circumstances, including working with the cultural forms and linguistic
materials specific to the present. The point is to pursue the collective
and dialogic nature of poetry without necessarily defining the nature of
this collectivity--call it a virtual collectivity or, to appropriate
Stanley Cavell's phrase for Emersonian moral perfectionism, "this new yet
unapproachable America": this unrepresentable yet ever presenting
collectivity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
In a recent book, <I>Modernisms: A Literary Guide, </I>the British critic
Peter Nicholls schematically contrasts two modernisms that may be applied
to American poetry. The first and more familiar kind, associated with a
partial reading of Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, "rests," in the words of
Peter Quartermain, "upon assumptions of a unitary self that carefully
differentiates itself from the world of the Object and thus asserts codes
of mastery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 In this type of modernism, the poem imposes a
(masculine) order and form on the (feminine) flux of modern world; the
self is imagined as closed, autonomous, distant, and antagonistic in its
effort to establish stable authority. Another modernism can be associated
especially with Gertrude Stein and her nonsymbological or constructive
practice. In Nicholls's words, this poetic practice is "preoccupied with
what seems other but turns out to be the same," thus unsettling the
autonomy of the self central to the first type of modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

"Stein shares with H. D. the desire to move beyond the object-based
poetics which derives its force from the repudiation of the feminine, and
to discover in its place a form of writing that reveals continuities
between self and world" by opening the self to that which is outside
it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P>
I would propose at least three modernist projects: subjective, objective,
and constructive. By nonsymbological or constructive, I am referring to
the fact that in many of her works Stein does not depend upon supplemental
literary or narrative contexts to secure her meaning but enacts her
subjects as continuously actualized presentations of meaning. Unlike Pound
or Eliot, with their myriad literary and other


<B></B>


references, or James
Joyce, with his etymological anaphora, with Stein you are left with the
words on the page and the Imaginary structures they build.

<P>
In the poetry of the past two decades, I think we have moved away from the
choice of subjective, objective, or even constructive and toward a
synthesizing or juxtaposing of these approaches. Here the influence of the
dialect poetries of the modernist period gives way to a dialectical poetry
that refuses allegiance to standard English without necessarily basing its
claim on an affiliation with a definable group's speaking practice. The
norm enforces a conduct of representation that precludes poetry as an
active agent to further thought, unbound to the restrictions of
rationalized ordering systems. Poetry can be a process of thinking rather
than a report of things already settled, an investigation of ration
rather than a picture of something red out. Such ideologically
informed nonstandard language practice I call "ideolectical"; I find it
equally present in British poets such as Maggie O'Sullivan, Tom Leonard,
and Tom Raworth; in U. S. poets such as Susan Howe, Bruce Andrews, Lyn
Hejinian, Leslie Scalapino, Harryette Mullen, Clark Coolidge, and
Nathaniel Mackey; in Canadian poets such as Steve McCaffery, Deanna
Ferguson, Nicole Brossard, and Karen MacCormack; or in such South American
poets as Perednik and Cecilia Vicuna.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P>
The invention of an ideolectical English-language poetry as a poetry of
the Americas involves the replacement of the national and geographically
centered category of English (or Spanish) poetry not with the equally
essentialist category of American poetry but with a field of
potentialities, a virtual America that we approach but never possess.
English languages, set adrift from the sight/sound sensorium of the
concrete experiences of the English people, are at their hearts uprooted
and translated: nomadic in origin, absolutely particular in practice.
Invention in this context is not a matter of choice: it is as necessary as
the ground we walk on.

<P>
The impossible poetics of the Americas of which I speak has, in the U. S.,
a history of breaks from the received literary language of England. The
vernacular was a crucial factor in many of those breaks, particularly as
explored by African American poets such as Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston
Hughes, Sterling Brown, J. W. Johnson, and Melvin Tolson. At the same
time, the American language was being transformed by the "bad" or "broken"
English of the European immigrants from the 1880s through the early years
of the new century: new syntaxes, new expressions came along with the new
world. Here it is significant that Williams, Stein, Louis Zukofsky, and
other makers of a new American poetry were themselves second-language
speakers of English, while others were children of second-language
speakers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 For these children of immigrants, English became
less transparent, more a medium subject to reforming. Correlatively, on
the other side of the Atlantic, the explorations of dialect traditions by
Basil Bunting and Hugh MacDiarmid, and in the Caribbean by Claude McKay
and more recently by Linton Kwesi Johnson, Louise Bennett, Michael Smith,
or Kamau Brathwaite (who rejects the term "dialect," preferring



<B></B>


"nation language"), become a source of shared language resources
among English-language poetries.

<P>
I realize that my emphasis on nonstandard language practices makes for
unexpected affiliations. Tony Crowley, in <I>Standard English and the
Politics of Language, </I>points to two senses of "standard." A standard
is a rallying point for the forward movement of an ideology or group, by
means of which a unity is invoked, as for example a flag in battle. But a
standard is also an objective unit of measure and regulator of uniformity,
and as such a product of normalization and averaging. Standard American
English involves both these senses: it is a sociohistorical construction,
embedding class, ethnic, and racial preferences, that serves to build
national unity; it is also a regulator of language practices, serving to
curb deviance. Under the aegis of standardization, problems of social
coherence are displaced onto questions of linguistic correctness:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The search for linguistic unity and identity is one that is founded on
acts of violence and repression: a denial of heteroglossia--discursive and
historical--in favour of centralizing, static forms. And the victory of
one dialect or language over others produces a hierarchy, an ordering of
discourse which excludes, distributes and defines what is to count as
discourse and what is to be relegated to oblivion. It brings into being
the "authoritative word" [that in Bakhtin's words] "is located in a
distanced zone, organically connected with a past that is felt to be
organically higher. It is, so to speak, the word of the fathers." There is
then no possibility of challenging this discourse. . . . Its authority is
already borne along with it and it is the authority of the ruling
patriarchal tradition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In "our" "own" literature, the most significant past debates on these
issues took place in two distinct quarters. Disowning and deflating the
"authoritative word" was a central project for Stein and other
constructivist poets of the modernist period. Even more explicitly,
however, standard English was the center of a debate that took place in
the frame of the Harlem Renaissance, itself a geographic displacement of
what is more accurately described as African American arts of the 1920s
and 1930s. Writers such as Hughes and Brown invented and defended a
vernacular poetry that refused the standards of literary English advocated
by poets such as Countee Cullen: a controversy that in many ways echoes
the debate between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. DuBois. The issue in
both controversies is the nature, terms, and price of assimilation.

<P>
As our literary history is usually told, the nonstandard language
practices of the radical modernists and their descendants are not linked
to the dialect and vernacular practices of African American
poets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 But the construction of a vernacular poetry was a
major project for many poets, black and white, during the modernist
period, and the fact that these developments often took place without
reference to each other--the fact of the color line--should not now
obscure their intimate formal and sociohistorical connections. Stein's
breakthrough into the ideolectical practice of <I>Tender Buttons, </I>for
example, was prepared by her problematic improvisations on African
American vernacular in "Melanctha." A generation later, both Tolson and



<B></B>


Zukofsky used complex literary framing devices as a means of working
with and against--I'd say torquing--vernacular linguistic materials. By
linking dialect and ideolect I wish to emphasize the common ground of
linguistic exploration, the invention of new syntaxes as akin to the
invention of new Americas, or of new possibilities for America. In
Brathwaite's account, however, dialect is better called "nation language"
and if that is the case it would seem to run counter to ideolect, whose
nations may be described, in Robin Blaser's phrase, as image nations,
imaginary, ideological; dialectical in that other sense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 I
don't wish to relieve this tension so much as try to locate it as pivotal
to our literary history and contemporary poetics. I am convinced, however,
that nonstandard writing practices share a technical commonality that
overrides the necessary differences in interpretation and motivation, and
this commonality may be the vortical prosodic force that gives us footing
with one another.

<P>
In <I>History of the Voice, </I>Brathwaite's 1979 talk about the "process
of using English in a different way from the 'norm,'" Brathwaite speaks of
the break with the pentameter metric of English verse as decisive in
establishing a distinct Caribbean national language rooted in an oral
tradition:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is <I>nation language </I>in the Caribbean that, in fact, largely
ignores the pentameter. . . . English it may be in terms of some of its
lexical features. But in its contours, its rhythms and timbre, its sound
explosions, it is not English, even though the words, as you hear them,
might be English to a greater or lesser degree. . . . But it is an English
which is not the standard, imported, educated English. . . . It is what I
call, as I say, <I>nation language. </I>I use the term in contrast to
<I>dialect. </I>The word "dialect" has been bandied about for a long time,
and it carries very pejorative overtones. . . . Nation language, on the
other hand, is the <I>submerged </I>area of dialect which is much more
closely allied to the African aspect of experience in the
Caribbean.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Brathwaite's nation language is as much a new standard to rally national
spirit as it is a break from standardization. Any comparison of
ideolectical and dialectical poetry must confront this obvious
contradiction: dialect, understood as nation language, has a centripetal
force, regrouping often denigrated and dispirited language practices
around a common center; ideolect, in contrast, suggests a centrifugal
force moving away from normative practices without necessarily replacing
them with a new center of gravity, at least defined by self or group.
Furthermore, the social positions from which these practices emerge will
often be quite distinct. Dialect poets may be regarded by the dominant
literary culture as outsiders, but they are often also at the center of
collective formations that are struggling to obtain self-respect and
cultural legitimacy. Ideolect poets often eschew the center with which
they may be associated by education or social position, to the point of
refusing the collective identities with which they might otherwise be
affiliated.

<P>
The work of Bunting and MacDiarmid is useful to consider in this respect
for they are both poets whose work, dialect and not, insisted on a
"northern" identity--Northumbrian and Scottish--while rejecting closed
forms of Northumbrian or Scots nationalism. MacDiarmid's sympathy for but
ultimate rejection by both Communist


<B></B>


and nationalist political
parties is exemplary of the tension between localism and socialism or
anarchism. Writing next to the Island center of traditional English verse,
their poetry skirts the distinction between dialect and ideolect in a
continuing dialogue between language and place that dances around and
within such ideological fractures and fractals, exposing the materiality
of sound patterns to the territorialization of desire. MacDiarmid and
Bunting had to invent aspects of the Scots and Northumbrian in <I>A Drunk
Man Looks at the Thistle </I>and <I>Briggflatts </I>(although the
inventions were quite different in each case). <I>Briggflatts </I>is more
a work of constructed syntax than an idiomatic reconstruction of an oral
tradition; aurality is its most salient feature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 If we
understand the direction of "English" away from its Island-English center
as a structural question, then we can begin to see links among poetic
projects involving secession, dispersal, and regrouping. We may understand
disparate practices as sharing a poetic space that is grounded not in an
identical social position but in the English language itself as the
material with which we make our regroupings and refoundings. Never just
English but always a new English that is an object and a subject of our
Verse. As Louise Bennett so eloquently and hilariously points out in her
1944 poem "Bans O' Killing," this issue is as much one of the past as of
the present and future:

<P>
Bennett's wit makes all the more disturbing her point that suppression of
"Variety" in language produces the cultural suppression of a people: "Bans
O' Killing." A people invents and sustains itself through its shared
language, so it is not surprising that colonial governments have often
prohibited the use of native languages, dialects, patois, creoles, and
pidgins in an effort to maintain social control. Bennett, all of whose
poetry is written in Jamaican idiom, points to, and defuses, the stigma
attached to dialect use; but she also makes patent the deep social scar
left by the denigration of a particular language practice as inferior. In
this sense, dialect becomes the verbal equivalent of skin color: an
"objective" mark of alterity.

<P>
The explicitly political use of dialect in contemporary poetry is apparent
in the work of Jamaican "dub" poet Michael Smith, even as he toys with old

Little has been written about Claude McKay's early dialect work, no doubt
due to the ambiguous status of certain literary dialect practices even for
such eloquent proponents of nation language as Brathwaite:

didn't let his language find its own parameters. [<I>HV,</I> 20]

<P>
Dialect practice can appear to be a form of self-deprecation as it
approaches "black face"--the minstrel mocking of black vernacular by white
as well as black performers. As Brathwaite remarks:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Dialect is thought of as "bad English." Dialect is "inferior English."

a long history of coming from the
plantation where people's dignity is distorted through their language and
the descriptions which the dialect gave to them. [<I>HV, </I>13]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The anxiety of dialect is inscribed already in Paul Laurence Dunbar's
work, where poems in "plantation" dialect are placed side by side with
poems in standard English, both sharing the heavily accented pentameter
that for Brathwaite marks them as problematic but that nonetheless makes
Dunbar's <I>Collected Poems </I> one of the most unsettling and
provocative works of early modernism. Brathwaite goes on to criticize
McKay for his turn to the sonnet in the poems for which he is most famous,
noting the heavy cost of McKay's desire for "universality" (<I>HV,</I>
20). This echoes the debate between advocates of standard literary verse
such as Countee Cullen and practitioners of the vernacular such as
Sterling Brown, a debate that is at the heart of Houston Baker's
<I>Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance. </I>Baker identifies the
controversy as between "mastery of form" and the "deformation of
mastery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 In contrast to my approach here, Baker champions
the assimilationist poetics of Cullen and Washington, arguing for the
long-term efficacy of using dominant cultural forms as one would a mask,
to provide camouflage while precluding total identification. At the same
time, he rebukes, unfortunately in my view, what he calls the
"guerrilla"
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 tactics of resistance and secession represented
by Dunbar and others involved with "sounding" "deformation," a position he
associates with DuBois.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P>
The use of dialectical or ideolectical language in a poem marks a refusal
of standard English as the common ground of communication. For poets
wishing to obliterate or overcome such marks of difference, the choice of
the conventional literary language, whether understood as mask or not,
reflects a willingness to abide by the linguistic norms of a culture and
to negotiate within these norms. Nonstandard language practice suggests an
element of cultural resistance that has as its lower limit dialogic
self-questioning and as its upper limit secession and autonomy.

<P>
Cullen took up the forms valued as universal by a dominant culture in
which the use of African American, as opposed to midwestern or
northeastern, dialect was taken to be a mark of inferiority; his work
wears its humanity on its sleeve, the only place where it could be seen in
a society defined in large measure by the color line. In such a reading,
Cullen can be understood as an American pragmatist par excellence.

<P>
Brathwaite, an advocate of nation language, that is, of linguistic
autonomy and self-sufficiency, makes an argument against the compromised
form of dialect practiced by McKay, seeing it, at best, as the beginning
of a cultural practice that comes to fruition, in the Caribbean, with
Bennett, Smith, Johnson, and his own work. In the U. S. during the
modernist period, Sterling Brown is probably the foremost practitioner of
such a poetics. For Brathwaite, nation language is not a deformation of
mastery but the sign of a newly forming collective identity. It moves
beyond critique and subversion to positive expressivity; that is, beyond a
bogus universality to what Brathwaite, problematically in my view,
understands as a genuine locality.

<P>
The tension between universality and locality is not simply a deformation
or an embryonic phase of group consciousness to be shed at maturity.
Against the positive


<B></B>


expressivity of nation language I would speak of
the negative dialectics of ideolect, where ideolect would mark those
poetic sites of contest between the hegemonic and the subaltern, to use
the terms of Antonio Gramsci. Here indeed would be a poetics of compromise
and dependency--of hybridization and contradiction and multivocality.
Under this sign of radical modernism, I would include not only Dunbar and
McKay, but also Hughes, Tolson, and Jean Toomer; and I would add, among
others, in the U. S., Zukofsky, Hart Crane, and Abraham Lincoln Gillespie,
and in the U. K., Bunting and MacDiarmid.

<P>
One thing these poets have in common is the influence of Marxism on their
poetic practice (Toomer may be the exception).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Marxism is a
universalist philosophy with a checkered history of (often contradictory)
critiques of nationalism as well as ethnic, racial, and sexual
essentialisms. Perhaps the most useful approach to this issue is found in
the work of Gramsci, a Sardinian Marxist whose critique of hegemony is
grounded in his own experience as a "subaltern" southerner whose language
was marked as inferior by its dialectical difference from the Italian of
the north.

<P>
In considering the internal contradictions between the local and the
universal, the subaltern and the hegemonic, I turn to McKay, who, in poems
of breathtaking duplicity and paradox, uses proto-Marxist ideas of
universalism to contest the hegemony of British culture in Jamaica. In
1912, when he was twenty-two and still living in Jamaica, McKay published
two collections of dialect poetry, <I>Songs of Jamaica </I>and <I>Constab
Ballads. </I>No one reading or commenting on these poems can fail to note
the many compromising aspects of this collection. Most obvious are running
translations and glosses at the foot of each page, providing unnecessary
and misleading translations of dialect words and often giving blatantly,
not to say comically, ameliorist interpretations of the poems. Like
Dunbar's <I>Collected Poems, </I>McKay's dialect poetry is a schizophrenic
presentation, foregrounding two unequally powerful readerships, black and
white. Given McKay's association with, as Brathwaite puts it, "a Svengali
like Walter Jekyll" (<I>HV,</I> 20), the controlling hand of white
editorial authority is always present on the page.

In McKay's 1912 collections, pentameter dialect is the ruse or wig that
allows a running double play of ingratiation and defiance. For the "white"
audience, the dialect plays as minstrel show: charming, even ingratiating
in its gratuitous nods to British sentiment and in its self-glossing
self-deprecations. At the same time, the poems compose a song to the
aesthetic power of difference, of the sonic and semantic richness of
vernacular Jamaican, while in their themes they corrode the very
authoritativeness to which they appear to be kowtowing, accumulating a
counterhegemonic force that mocks every surface pretence of accommodation.
This double play brings to mind Melville's <I>Benito Cereno, </I>which, as
Aldon Nielsen points out "is a dramatization of the white racist mind
<I>not reacting </I>in the face of a slave insurrection; for the dramatic
irony of the novel derives from Delano's inability to recognize that which
is palpably before him. He is so much inhabited by the discourse
agreements of white mythology" that he (mis)interprets "the actuality of
the slave revolt" as stereotypical gestures of "servile
loyalty."

On the surface, this is a poem of nostalgia and complacency, even ending
on the subservient note of the native returning home from the Mother
country, resting "glad an' contented in me min' for evermore" (<I>DP,</I>
65). No wonder Brathwaite points to this poem as an example of McKay's
"literary colonialism in the primordial (?) anglicanism" (<I>HV,</I> 20).
But the poem overplays the sentiment in a way that, at least at the
distance from which I am reading it, calls attention to itself, or calls
for a different kind of attention, a reading between the lines. What,
after all, is this "great / Learning" coming from "relics" of an "old
fait'" but the old <I>fate </I>of racism and colonialism; what is this
"beauty lyin' all aroun'" but more relics of lying beauty, overturned by
the "real truths" or Reason. For this poem, after all, is unambiguous in
enforcing the truths (plural) or Reason (capital <I>R</I>): the cant of
the preachers is a lying


<B></B>


beauty, a wreck of learning that appears
beautiful or truthful only with eyes "trained" (by whom?). Read as wig,
the poem begins to destabilize, though a line like "I would ope me mout'
wid wonder at de massive organ soun'" remains difficult, as far as I can
see, to turn round. Yet even the textual glosses can seem to take on
significance; here, only two words, among a number equally nonstandard,
are singled out for definition: "t'o't"--thought (<I>DP,</I> 63), and
"min"--mind (<I>DP,</I> 65). It's as if we are to be reminded that the
"native" has thoughts and a mind of his own: in this sense <I>mine </I>is
synonymous with <I>mind. </I>Perhaps this poem is not so far from Louise
Bennett's work after all, considering that McKay's work was Bennett's
first example of Jamaican dialect poetry (<I>HV,</I> 28). Even the "old"
in "Old England" begins to seem more ominous.

<P>
Am I overreading? McKay is careful to note in <I>A Long Way from Home
</I>that he became a "free-thinker" before he was thirteen, discovering
"like a comet . . . the romance of science in Huxley's <I>Man's Place in
Nature </I>and Haeckel's <I>The Riddle of the Universe."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

By the time he was writing <I>Songs of Jamaica </I>and <I>Constab Ballads,
</I>McKay was steeped in Baruch Spinoza (for a while he considered himself
a pantheist), Schopenhauer, and Herbert Spencer (and by extension Erasmus
Darwin).

<P>
Consider McKay's "Cudjoe Fresh from de Lecture" about "How de buccra
te-day tek time an' b&eacute;gin teach / All of us dat was deh in a clear
open speach" (<I>DP,</I> 55). The buccra's, or white man's, "open speech"
is about evolution, a humanist scientific theory that, in Cudjoe's
interpretation, undermines the racist ideas that are lived out in the
plantation system reflected in the "imprisoned pentameter," or closed
(constrained) speech, of the poem: "Him tell us 'bout we self, an' mek we
fresh again" (<I>DP,</I> 55). This idea of being made "fresh" (not used,
exploited) is what Cudjoe tells as the urgent "news" (<I>DP,</I> 55) from
this lecture:

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">[<I>DP,</I> 55]

<P>
Looking upon his black skin he also sees his black <I>kin </I>in this
collective vision of the equality of "ebery . . . man." On one reading "me
head grow big" has the same stereotyping gesture of self-patronization as
"ope me mout' wid wonder," but taken literally it means the opposite--the
news reverses the patronizing of Cudjoe and his kin, returns heads to
actual size. If the evolution "tell us 'traight 'bout how de whole t'ing
came" (<I>DP,</I> 56), then Christianity, which preaches that blackness is
a "cuss," tells it crooked: "An' looking close at t'ings, we hab to pray
quite hard / Fe swaller wha' him say an' don't t'ink bad o' Gahd."
(<I>DP,</I> 56) Ingratiation or defiance hidden in a smirk as broad as the
face of "Gahd"? If evolution preaches chance not predetermination, then
the scenario of <I>Benito Cereno</I> is closer to hand, for no natural law
precludes the justice of insurrection (the hound, let's say, being on the
other tooth): "But suppose eberyt'ing could tu'n right upside down, / Den
p'rhaps we'd be on top an' givin' some one houn'." (<I>DP,</I> 57) The
very next stanza quells such an interpretation, noting that

 were the
Africans not brought to the Americas they might still be "half-naked . . .
tearin' t'rough de bush wid all de monkey" (<I>DP,</I> 57)--"Wile an'
uncibilise', an' neber comin' tame." (<I>DP,</I> 57) Yet the poem is not
about the taming effect of this "clear open speech" but how this way of
thinking inspires strong feelings that lead to Cudjoe's <I>own
</I>uncorked "talk." Acknowledging that his talk is going in two
directions, Cudjoe then ends by saying maybe not:

<P>
The buccra stops the gallop of Cudjoe's racing thoughts by saying right
will never be. But the last line of the poem is ambiguous: for if wrong
will grow till this world ends <I>for us, </I>doesn't that mean that we
will have to end it ourselves, so that we may establish the truth of a new
world? I hear this, anyway, with all the doubling I have so far noted, in
the title of a poem that might be read as a hymn to accommodation, "Whe'
Fe Do?" The gloss provided for this title encapsulates the issues sharply;
it runs like this: "What to do?--equivalent to 'What can't be cured, must
be endured.'" (<I>DP,</I> 27) Each stanza of the poem ends with a
variation on the title's question: "All we can do" (<I>DP,</I> 27); "Dat
we might do" (<I>DP,</I> 27); "For dat caan' do" (<I>DP,</I> 28); "Whe'
else fe do?" (<I>DP,</I> 28); "De best to do," (<I>DP,</I> 28); and
finally "But whe' fe do?" (<I>DP,</I> 29). But can't (caan') the title
also mean What Is to Be Done?--all that can be done, what's best to do,
what must be done?

<P>
What to make of this? In McKay's Jamaica poems, iambic pentameter is made
the metrical mark of colonialism, the chains around a corrosive dialect.
Pentameter is used to serve as the acoustic trappings of "old England,"
yoked to a diffident creole, the weird ordinary of verse dialect. It is an
oxymoronic form. In this sense, the dialect poems have a similar implosive
power to McKay's "If We Must Die," written five years after his move to
the U. S. in 1914, which creates a tension between the conventional
expectations of the Elizabethan sonnet form and the violent and unsettling
subject matter.

<P>
Claude McKay's Jamaica poems are not free verse. They are marked by their
uneasy relation to the cultural regime under which they were written. But
what is the natural form for a vernacular poetry?
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 MacDiarmid
and Bunting offer a radically modernist setting for their dialect work
that is a far cry from the more direct, sometimes ethnographic,
representations of Sterling Brown. Hughes's style is fluid but often sets
itself apart from the quoted vernacular that peoples his work (as in "The
Weary Blues"); unlike in Brown, identification with the demotic voices is
not total. In his <I>Harlem Gallery: Book I, The Curator, </I>Melvin
Tolson chooses a radically defamiliarizing form to set his multilectical
excursions:

<!--_/poetry-->

<P>
This is neither universal poetry nor nation language; it is "quaquaversal
poetry," a close relative to ideolect. Tolson's hybridization of
discourse, featuring the music of shattering glass (pentameter anyone?) on
the tray of a Creole co-ed from New Orleans by way of the Upper West Side,
mixes cultural references with the sophisticated &eacute;lan of a poet who
makes language his home: the poet's feast is this counterpoint of
contrasting rhythms, protest, and pride. It's not that the indigenous
cultural forms of African Americans--spiritual, work song, ragtime, and
blues, so remarkably and directly charted in Brown's poetry--are the same
as the European dance forms, but that a process of Creolization is
underway: they consort with each in the dance of America.

<P>
The closest thing I can think of to Tolson's dazzling mix of citations and
refutations, discourse as concourse, is Zukofsky's collage poems, from
"Poem Beginning 'The'" to <I>"A."</I> I think the Creole co-ed may even be
a kissing cousin to Zukofsky's "A Foin Lass" in his translation into
Brooklynese of "Donna mi Prega," "A Foin Lass Bodders." Zukofsky's use of
slang is not, to be sure, an instance of cultural identification, and
Zukofsky's sense of his Jewishness reflected the ambivalence of many
leftists of his generation. He had, after all, chosen not to write in his
native tongue, or at least the language of his parents, Yiddish,
specifically choosing not to join with his differently radical
contemporaries who wrote Yiddish poetry as an assertion of what could well
be called Jewish nation language. But Zukofsky's ear was tuned to the
local and the vernacular, and even as he transforms the demotic into his
own brand of ideolect the origin in the ordinary is patent.

<P>
When de Certeau writes of the practice of the wig as "an ordinary art," he
provides a reminder that dialect and ideolect practices are practices of
the ordinary, and in this way linked to other demotic literary practices;
but also that the ordinary grounds itself in provisional constructions,
not natural facts. The ordinary eludes fixed forms of representation; it
can be evoked, not captured. For the ordinary captured becomes merely
captions on a vanished object, an evacuated site for the residual



<B></B>


rubbernecking of exhausted passers-by. The poetic practice of the
ordinary is synthetic and synthesizing, not essentializing. Verse dialect,
like any representation of speech in writing, is always a form of
invention.

<P>
One of the extraordinary things about the poetics of the ordinary is that
it can make poems that look so strange. Any approach to the ordinary is
partial because the ordinary, like materiality itself, is inexhaustible.
The poetics of the ordinary can set its sights on a series of aspects--on
meter, on diction, on theme, on lexicon. Poetic attention to any one of
these aspects may make a poem that will seem alien to those accustomed to
different literary conventions. Transcribed speech, for example, may seem
more unnatural than the idealized conventions for representing speech.
Dialect, because it uses a nonstandard lexicon, can look as odd as the
<I>zaum </I>or neologistic poems of Velimer Khlebnikov or David Melnick or
Gillespie or P. Inman, even to the native speaker of the represented
idiom. The ordinary erodes and resists the standard, and yet standard
English and normative verse forms exoticize and defamiliarize the
ordinary. There can be no completely ordinary poetry because there can be
no poetry without style or form. "We fling ourselves, constantly longing,
on this form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P>
Very little has been written about the ideolectical writing of Abraham
Lincoln Gillespie. Gillespie's pervasively neologistic work bears some
resemblance to <I>Finnegans Wake; </I>certainly, Gillespie knew Joyce.
Unlike Joyce, Gillespie was not interested in maximizing the etymological
resonances of words but in creating a kind of scat writing, with jazz as a
significant influence. American identity, along with "Self" expression, is
certainly under erasure, or more likely actively being erased, in
"Expatracination" (out from fatherland and race/roots), Gillespie's
response to a 1928 <I>transition </I>questionnaire on Americans living in
Europe:

If dialect poetry seems to foster group identification, ideolect poetry
may seem to foster the opposite: a rejection or troubling of identity
structures, be they group or individual. Yet the rejection of received
ideas of identity can also be understood as the continuation of the
politics of identity by other means. The poetics of identity cannot be
symmetrical for the subaltern and for that which it is subaltern to. For



<B></B>


every poetics of cultural legitimation might not there also need to
be a poetics of delegitimation?, as in, Please move over; or else we fall
in the "groove-compulsed . . . Banter" of America as (we are not) "Good
Will-Collective." This passage from Gillespie reminds me of nothing so
much as one of Bruce Andrews's "dynaSaxophoneyc" riffs of invented slang
in <I>I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up (or, Social Romanticism),
</I>which, like Gillespie's work, approaches the vernacular question from
the other end of the stick, i. e., none too pretty out there. The
evisceration of a preassigned cultural identity, as in Andrews (son, like
Gillespie, of affluent white America), is also a form of identity
politics.

<P>
Khlebnikov's <I>zaum, </I>or transense poetry, was made to transcend the
divisions of national languages; he wanted to write an ideolect that all

high coefficient of weirdness, which is to say its abiding and enchanting
peculiarity. At another subdivision of this spectrum, David Melnick's
homophonic, and therefore ideolectical, translation of Homer, <I>Men in
Aida, </I>may first be read for the sheer pleasure of its sonic plenitude;
but after a while the playful signification of both a gay and poetic
"sub"culture, an erotic and writerly community, is unmistakable:

<P>
As dialect becomes vernacular, as the demotic is traded for ideolect, we
may hear a complication or evasion or erasure of identity more than a
celebration of it: an exploration of the space between identities more
than the establishment of a primary identity. Then again, perhaps what we
hear is a writing that goes beyond the present definitions and
inscriptions of collective and individual identifications, and toward a
virtual or coming identity about which these confusions and
comminglings--call them confabulations--hint, as if such writing leaves
room for readers' multifoliate projections.

<P>
I am conscious that an ideolectical poetry, insofar as it may dismantle
whatever self or group identities we may have already developed, risks
making us more atomized and so more passive. In this state of "postmodern"
paranoia, all collective formations--real or imagined--are ironized or
aestheticized, that is, debunked as arbitrary codes, with fashion and
market ascendant as the arbiters of value. If social identities are to be
made problematic as part of the poetic process, this may be in order to
forge new collective identities that will enable a more resourceful
resistance to rigidly territorializing clannishness and paralyzingly
depoliticizing codicity.

<P>
The problem is how to be resistant to the reductiveness of all forms of
positivism without succumbing to the relativistic erosions of market value
that transform poetry from an arena for social exploration or expression
to an empty marker of "subjectivity" in designated Free Trade Zones (to
which both poet and reader are subject). That is, to presume a realm of
social truths against the one truth of technorationality and its schizoid
doubles, triumphalist capitalism and religious fundamentalism.

<P>
William Blake remains the greatest emblem of this "Mental

<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P>
<I>The point is not to display imagination but to mobilize
imaginations.</I>

<P>
But how can we mobilize imaginations, those imaginary nations, when, for
the most part, "imagination" and "subjectivity" have become house pets of
the personal lifestyle industry, cousins to a "creativity" that seems to
apply more to earrings than to hearing? This is no doubt Adorno's fear in
questioning the historical role of lyric


<B></B>


poetry in the wake of a
systematic extermination process that shows up all our means of
representation as thin, palely inadequate to the realities at
hand.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P>
For most conventional verse practices, like many other forms of cultural
production, are more the products of an ideological system than of any
putative author. As a result, they can be read as cultural symptoms rather
than as the inspired and original works of an autonomous author. However,
the current movement of cultural studies risks leveling all art to the
status of symptom. For poetry can, even if it often doesn't, resist
absorption into the zeitgeist. No artist can remain entirely free from
collaboration with the society in which she or he works--history is too
consuming for that--but relative degrees of resistance are possible. Art
can provide a means by which to read culture, cognitive maps if you will.
New forms provide new methods of critique.

<P>
Surely, the subjectivized, gutted lyric that dominates poetry today proves
Adorno's point. Nonetheless, from this same historical point of view, I
would say that poetry is the most necessary form of language practice
after the wars: but a different poetry than we have known. The task of
creating this poetry is impossible and for that reason takes place.

American Poetry, </I>ed. Aldon L. Nielsen (Urbana: University of Illinois
Press, in press). An initial version of the essay was prompted in part by
a panel on the "Poetics of Americas" organized by Ernesto Grosman and
presented at New York University in March 1994. Much of the material in it
was presented in a series of seminars at the Poetics Program at
SUNY-Buffalo; I am indebted to many of the participants for their
comments. Thanks also to Nick Lawrence.

A new and important exception is Michael North's <I>The Dialect
ofModernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature</I>
(New York:
Oxford University Press, 1994). North contrasts the mimicry of black
dialect by white modernists and the skepticism of some African American
poets toward dialect:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Linguistic imitation and racial masquerade are so important to
transatlantic modernism because they allow the writer to play at
self-fashioning. Jazz means freedom to Jakie Rabinowitz [the Jolson
character in <I>The Jazz Singer</I>] partly because it is fast and
rhythmically unrestrained but also because it is not ancestrally his. . .
. For African-American poets of this generation, however, dialect is a
"chain." In the version created by the white minstrel tradition, it is a
constant reminder of the literal unfreedom of slavery . . .  [11].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This reflects, in part, the view of James Weldon Johnson, who in his
preface to <I>God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse</I> (1927; New
York: Penguin, 1990) underscores that dialect verse is a "limited
instrument . . . with but two complete stops, pathos and humor" .

<P>
North goes on to scrutinize dialect and "primitivist" elements in such
modernists as Eliot, Stein, Williams, and Mina Loy, which he sees not as
forging a new poetics of the Americas but as trapped in a racist
ventriloquism. Indeed, North suggests that "white interest in
African-American language and culture was, if anything, more dangerous
than indifference" --a conclusion that is sucked into the very vicious
circles that North's book sets out to critique.

"The new English that each uses is inescapably itself, a shade aliento
the ear and at the same time a shade more 'authentically' English,
because it departs from the koine, standard English, even though it is
comprehensible in an ordinary English context and to an ordinary English
ear (whatever ordinary means there--one used to [hear] 'standard' I
suppose, but that concept has been decaying for the last forty or so years
I think). You'll have noted that I'm saying nothing about what sort of
syntax that is, but I do think it cultivates turbulence and roughness to
the ear and tongue because the smooth and the graceful and the beautiful .
. . are not only 'southron' but also 'literary,' gesturing lazily as they
do to a pitifully limited concept of what constitutes the sublime. Like
Mina Loy, they cultivate 'gracelessness' (but then one has to define
'grace,' no?) and might indeed be said to share with her the project which
says 'I do not write poetry'--if what the centre produces is poetry, then
they want none of it, reaching to another definition of sense and
discourse, derived from dialect/ideolect speech, and from prose." (Peter

Science and Modernism: A Panel
<!--_/title-->
</H2>
<hr>
<!--_text-->
<P>
<I>The truth may not set us free, but it does make for lively
arguments. The following three papers were given at the 1995 Modern
Language Association panel, "Science and Modernism." Although the
panelists did not consult each other in advance, the dialogue that
emerges among these papers is remarkable. Both Christopher Herbert and
George Levine bring Karl Pearson, the turn-of-the-century mathematician,
eugenicist, and one of the "inventors" of modern statistics, into a
controversy about the degree to which scientists taint their inquiry,
and vice versa. Levine and Herbert both point out that Pearson's
negotiation of indeterminancy and his mapping out of the constructedness
of normativity presages the much later critiques of Michel Foucault and
French post-structuralism; the implication is that we still have much
to learn from historical inquiry into the intellectual milieu of the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Susan Squier's anatomy of
the embryo in modern literature outlines another mode of knowing--what
are the means whereby science infects literature with truth claims,
and literature infects science with the shapes of belief? The general
question is how we negotiate the question of contagion in the hot zone
of inquiry, be it science or literature.</I>

<P>
<I>Interdisciplinarity always brings methodological controversy to the
foreground. How a gestalt from one discipline comes to know the gestalt
next door is a major concern of historical criticism. Transmission, how
information and structures migrate or are transmitted from some discrete
body or field, from one walled-in area to another, whether those walls
are made of protein or concrete, will always be most important to
interdisciplinary studies.</I>

<P>
<I>I want especially to thank Robert Caserio, who originally convened the
panel, and the Division on Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century
English Literature for assembling the panel and giving me the opportunity
to chair it, and to present these papers.</I>

In a 1917 apologia for psychoanalysis, Freud portrays the history of
science as a series of parallel revolutions, each in its own domain
inflicting chastisement upon the retrograde influence of what he terms
human "narcissism." The mandate of scientific thought, according to Freud,
is to abolish all the fallacies that arise from anthropocentrism, from
ascribing a privileged position in the natural world to human values or a
human point of view. Copernican astronomy, Darwinian biology, and now
psychoanalysis all give expression to this paramount motive of science,
"the destruction of . . . narcissistic illusion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 This
definition of scientific method as (in Freud's repeated term) the
"wounding" of human self-love fits closely with his analysis in texts such
as <I>Civilization and Its Discontents</I> of the cruel mutilations of
libido that civilization necessarily exacts upon mankind. Given the
sadistic impulse that he identifies as the crucial imperative in science,
it is no wonder that he worries in this essay that many regard his own new
science with "aversion and resistances."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P>
The indictment of anthropocentrism was hardly original to Freud. Around
the turn of the twentieth century and in the following several decades, it
was proclaimed with a frequency that seems to signal some noteworthy
cultural perturbation. One writer after another identifies
anthropomorphism or anthropocentrism as precisely the antithesis, the
nullification, of science. "Anthropomorphism plays a considerable historic
role" in the genesis of physical thinking, admits the mathematician Henri
Poincar&eacute; in 1902, "but it can be the foundation of nothing of a
really scientific or philosophical character."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 In keeping with
a


<B></B>


series of late Victorian writers who identify anthropomorphism
as the characteristic mode of thought of "primitive man," of the
prescientific mentality, James Frazer in <I>The Golden Bough</I> attempts
a vast evolutionary reconstruction of this deluded phase of thinking.
Central to his analysis is his definition of myth as "a description of
physical phenomena in imagery borrowed from human life"; science, which he
calls the "golden key" to truth, by contrast, is the method that as its
primary operation "strips nature of personality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 In his
analysis of the superstitious roots of primitive anthropomorphism, Frazer
means to drive a scientific stake at last into the heart of this ancient
source of folly, ignorance, and cruelty.

<P>
Not every contemporary observer was sanguine about soon eliminating the
lethal contaminant of human narcissism from science. Arthur James Balfour
declares in 1879 that "our idea of the external world is . . .
anthropomorphic" inescapably, concluding from this that science is
afflicted with an irrationalism that no amount of supposed methodological
rigor can ever cure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The anthropologist and philosopher Lucien
L&eacute;vy-Bruhl, in his book <I>Ethics and Moral Science</I> of 1903,
frames the same problem in only marginally less pessimistic terms,
focusing now on biology. Scientific research strives to cleanse knowledge
of what he calls its "specifically human character" and thus to attain
"objectivity," he declares.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Yet so deeply ingrained is the
anthropocentric principle in human thought, says L&eacute;vy-Bruhl, that
even the mighty achievements of modern science have failed to annihilate
it. "The struggle against anthropocentrism is far from ended," he
concludes; "its strongest positions are not yet touched. It has only lost,
so to speak, its outworks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P>
The declaration of war on anthropocentrism may constitute the permanent
creed or charter of true science, as all these writers take for granted,
but the prominence of this theme in turn-of-the-century discourse
indicates its distinct period-specific character, too, as one component of
the wave of new thought and expression, and of anxiety, known as
modernism. As the reaction against a period perceived as in thrall to
complacent sentimentalities and self-aggrandizing systems masquerading as
timeless verities, modernism in one of its aspects takes a mood of
critical astringency and of a principled denial of self-gratification as
the mark of rectitude in sophisticated intellectual inquiry. This is the
aspect of modernism anatomized, for instance, by Jos&eacute; Ortega y
Gasset in his essay "The Dehumanization of Art." Serious modern artists,
he declares, take it as their mission to create artworks from which
narcissistic appeals to human sentiment have been systematically purged by
means of "an explicit act of dehumanization"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
--and, for that
matter, take reactions of "aversion and resistances" from the general
public as evidence of their success. Modernist discourse on science
converges unmistakably at this point with modernist literary
interpretation.

<P>
However, there emerges in the same period a countercurrent to the dominant
trend of argument and ideology just described: a dissident movement that
opposes the definition of scientific method as a suppressing of
anthropocentric fallacies and stripping nature of personality. "The
subject of science is the human universe," declares the mathematician W.
K. Clifford at the early date of 1872; "that is to say, everything that
is, or has been, or may be related to man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The proponents of
the


<B></B>


movement announced by Clifford challenge the assumption that
scientific objectivity must or can rest upon what are called, in a phrase
much bandied about by late Victorian controversialists, "absolute truths."
They argue that scientific rationality can never free itself from "imagery
borrowed from human life," and that in striving to do so, it becomes
incoherent and sacrifices its claim to intellectual legitimacy. They
suggest that the credo of science as the persecutor of human narcissism
originates in a will to tyrannical domination. This movement of what could
be called the rehumanization of knowledge is inseparable from that
elaboration of the relativistic principle that constitutes one of the
defining intellectual projects of the modernist period. In all the forms
that this project assumes, it holds up to critical analysis the
widespread, almost compulsive determination to shield from view the human
image stamped ineffaceably upon all the intellectual productions of our
species.

<P>
I will not dwell on Ludwig Feuerbach here, but a full retrieval of the
history of the anthropomorphic theme in modern discourse would need to
assign him an important chapter. In his great polemic of 1841, <I>The
Essence of Christianity,</I> translated into English by George Eliot in
1854, Feuerbach trains his critique upon theology, but its implications
extend widely into other areas of thought as well. God properly
understood, Feuerbach declares, is an idealized projection of mankind;
religion, the supreme expression of human narcissism, thus originates in
and symbolizes "the deification of man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In the words of
Feuerbach's famous motto, "the beginning, middle and end of religion is
MAN" (<I>EC,</I> 184). For malign purposes of its own, theology
misrepresents this state of affairs, falsely denying the anthropomorphic
character of God and in so doing "[attaching] religion to an external
object" (<I>EC,</I> 11). In short, Feuerbach sees theology as an agency of
the same denial of anthropomorphism that Freud and others ascribe
honorifically to modern science--though for Feuerbach, this denial is the
very reverse of a rolling back of superstition. In dispossessing humanity
of its ultimate imaginative creation, it produces as its chief effect "the
disuniting of man from himself"; indeed, it "sets God before [man] as the
antithesis of himself," in a relation of estrangement and hostility
(<I>EC,</I> 33). All the fanatical obsession of Christian thinkers with
the category of absolute truth, all their morbid hostility to and
vindictive repression of human nature, and all the sanguinary abominations
of religious history--all these things flow, according to Feuerbach, from
the theological denial of the truth that the divine is constructed wholly
of "imagery borrowed from human life." In <I>The Essence of
Christianity,</I> the rejection of anthropomorphism is a purely diabolical
moment.

<P>
In this essay, I will trace Feuerbach's intellectual legacy in only a
single representative text, Karl Pearson's <I>The Grammar of Science,</I>
which first appeared in 1892, fifty-one years after <I>The Essence of
Christianity.</I> Pearson never refers to Feuerbach, but seems to have him
at least unconsciously in mind as he surveys the systematic perversion of
another department of knowledge, that of modern physics. The vocabulary of
the polemic has shifted, in keeping with the times. What Feuerbach calls
"theology," Pearson in effect names "materialism."


<B></B>

<P>
<I>The Grammar of Science</I> begins on a note far removed from
Feuerbachian skepticism, professing what looks like an orthodox faith in
scientific knowledge, particularly in the burgeoning field of physics.
Legitimate science appeals strictly to the reason and disavows the
imagination, Pearson declares, in a distinctly anti-Feuerbachian spirit.
Scientific reasoning forms an ideal training for modern citizenship in a
period of rampant controversy and uncertainty, since it depends on the
principle of what he terms "self-elimination," the principled setting
aside of "personal bias"--in other words, of that element of narcissism or
anthropocentrism that Freud also tells us is the enemy of rational
understanding.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Science, says Pearson here, is above all a
stringent, ascetic discipline, dehumanized in exactly Ortega's sense,
treading unswervingly what is called "the hard and stony path of
classifying facts and reasoning upon them" (<I>GS,</I> 17). The theory of
modern science as an engine for the systematic mortification of human
narcissism could hardly find a fuller expression than in this opening
movement of Pearson's treatise.

<P>
It is with a calculated rhetorical suddenness, then, that <I>The Grammar
of Science</I> swerves into another analytical register--flying, in fact,
squarely in the face of Pearson's opening profession of faith. The human
creative imagination, a few pages previously excluded from the domain of
respectable science, is now identified as, after all, the source "of all
great scientific discoveries" (<I>GS,</I> 30). And now, in place of the
austere discipline of scientific analysis plodding laboriously along "the
hard and stony path" of fact, science, like art, proves to be driven by
the <I>jouissance</I> proper to the experience of beauty: "both afford
material for the gratification of the aesthetic judgment" (<I>GS,</I> 36).
Pearson does not quite assert that the beauty of a scientific theory could
be a measure of its truth, as others have since, but his argument points
unmistakably in this direction.

<P>
He takes a bold step further: "The universe is largely the construction of
each individual mind," he declares, and is therefore "a variable
quantity," altering with each succeeding generation of scientists
(<I>GS,</I> 15). "External objects," a phrase regularly placed within
quotation marks in this book, are not self-existent entities confronting
human perception; rather, in accordance with what Pearson, naming his
chief principle of analysis, calls "the pure relativity of all phenomena"
(<I>GS,</I> 394 n), they are constructions of the human faculties. By the
same token, scientific "laws of nature" are manufactures of human thought,
without a basis in any world of external reality. "It may seem at first
sight strange to the reader," says Pearson, "that the laws of science
should thus be associated with the creative imagination in man rather than
with the physical world outside him" (<I>GS,</I> 36), but such is the
case, he insists. "Law in the scientific sense is . . . essentially a
product of the human mind and has no meaning apart from man. It owes its
existence to the creative power of his intellect. There is more meaning in
the statement that man gives laws to Nature than in its converse that
Nature gives laws to man" (<I>GS,</I> 87).

<P>
For Pearson, in other words, once physical science falls under the sign of
a principle of "pure relativity," it becomes of necessity radically and
militantly anthropocentric


<B></B>


 and, in Freud's sense,
narcissistic. The
human being is promoted in this text to the status of nothing less than
the creator of the universe and the author of its laws: in this sense,
<I>The Grammar of Science</I> proposes its own version of "the deification
of man." Yet the so-called laws of nature that human scientists, driven by
the craving for esthetic pleasure, labor to articulate are in fact not so
much inventions as they are simply the principles of human cognition
itself. "The logic man finds in the universe is but the reflection of his
own reasoning faculty" (<I>GS,</I> 91), says Pearson, his metaphor of
reflection here bringing the Narcissus myth distinctly to mind. Science
does not imagine deities in human form within nature, but it depends on an
analogous mental operation, for it imagines particles, waves, and forces
behaving in accordance with human laws of logic. Pearson's doctrine, we
may say, paraphrasing Feuerbach, is that "the beginning, middle, and end
of science is MAN."

<P>
The reign of the false doctrines of what Pearson calls, synonymously,
"materialism" and "metaphysics" has come about in accordance with exactly
the dispossessing, traumatically alienating event diagnosed by Feuerbach
in the domain of religious imagination--and, in the meantime, by Marx in
the field of capitalist production. The materialist philosopher of
science, says Pearson, "unconsciously severs himself from the products of
his own reason, projects them into phenomena, only to refind them again
and wonder what reason put them there" (<I>GS,</I> 91); this same
materialist philosopher, we are told, constructs a universe of objects
related by natural laws "and then--as his habit is--forgetful of his own
creative facility, has converted [them] into a dominant reality behind his
perceptions and external to himself" (<I>GS,</I> 167). Pearson, like his
mentor the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, claims that science has
no business explaining the phenomena it studies, and so he does not
attempt to explain the appearance of this syndrome of perverse
misunderstanding, which shrouds scientific rationality in metaphysics, and
in the process, not at all incidentally, inculcates an ethic of subjection
to a so-called "dominant reality" (<I>GS,</I> 167). As far as his text
explicitly states, scientist-philosophers fall into metaphysics simply in
a fit of forgetfulness. Such a complex would be easy to interpret,
however, as the necessary outcome of the ideology of science being
promoted with such fervor by Freud, Poincar&eacute;, and many others at
this period, to the effect that the progress of scientific knowledge can
only come about by means of--in fact is identical to--the repression of
the vice of human narcissism. Science in this official view is that
intellectual enterprise dedicated to teaching man his subordinate place in
the universe, where he is to eat his bread in humility. Abjuring human
creativity, imagining perceptions as external objects, and revering
"absolute truth" in science as in other domains of human life--these are
simply the epistemological corollaries of this moral commandment of
poverty and self-abnegation: so runs the implicit logic of Pearson's text.

<P>
To follow out this logic is to move with Pearson's help toward
understanding the anti-anthropocentric dogma of turn-of-the-century
science as a residue of a cultural dynamic deeply associated with the
"Victorian" moment in Europe, and as playing to some degree a dissonant,
unstable role, even a regressive one, with regard to the


<B></B>


modernist
enterprise at large. A definition of science as first and foremost an
agency for "the destruction of . . . narcissistic illusion" is almost too
symmetrical with Feuerbach's analysis of theological authoritarianism or
with, say, John Stuart Mill's assertion that the defining feature of the
Victorian milieu was its domination by what he called "the engines of
moral repression."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Feuerbach's and Mill's analyses suggest,
that is to say, the heavy ideological burden of Freud's idea of science;
more to the immediate point, they help to make legible the satirical idiom
of Pearson's <I>Grammar of Science.</I> His method in much of the book
centers on rigorously deconstructive studies of the categories of
classical mechanics (force, mass, matter, absolute space and time,
causality, the ether, and so on), showing each in turn to suffer from
hopeless logical incoherence and in fact to be scientifically vacuous. If
we follow the skein of implication that gradually unwinds from these
exercises in <I>The Grammar of Science,</I> we come to view the physical
world constructed by Newtonian mechanics--a preposterous world of massive
bodies, mysterious forces, implacable laws of causality--as, among other
things, the characteristic self-expression of a cultural and intellectual
system based on the repressive rule of a caste of lawgiving authorities.
And this, Pearson makes sufficiently clear, is exactly the state of
affairs that his theory of science is meant to address.

<P>
What he refers to as the "maze of metaphysics which at present obstructs
the entry of physics" (<I>GS,</I> 221) thus signifies for Pearson not an
innocent intellectual miscalculation after all, but an imprisoning
structure of mystification, the function of which is to lock our critical
and imaginative faculties helplessly within a system of external
absolutes. Physicists' elaborately circular, illogical, self-contradicting
theories of such entities as force and matter, which Pearson documents at
length with reference to writings of James Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, P. G.
Tait, and other eminent scientists, exemplify for him the same pernicious
mode of discourse allegorized by Charles Dickens in <I>Bleak House</I> as
the "monstrous maze" of legal mumbo jumbo (an impenetrable labyrinth of
"numerous difficulties, contingencies, masterly fictions, and forms of
procedure"): webs of language designed in both cases to produce a
condition of stupefied acquiescence to the established order.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

Pearson's extravagant stress on human creativity and on the doctrine of
"the pure relativity of all phenomena" springs from an expressly
emancipatory intention, in other words. Nor does this intention confine
itself to the field of absolutist Newtonian mechanics. As Henry Adams put
it in his comments on what he called Pearson's "revolutionary" book, what
Pearson seeks to dismantle is nothing less than the whole order of
thinking that had "created a universe the essence of which was abstract
Truth; the Absolute; God!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Adams understood with perfect
clarity the Feuerbachian impulse that drove Pearson's critique of physics.

<P>
The modern relativistic tradition from <I>The Essence of Christianity</I>
onward seeks to counteract the regime of dehumanized absolutes by
installing a frankly anthropocentric theory of science based on human and
humane values. It inserts the principles of the inescapable mutability of
knowledge, of the legitimacy of "<I>alternative</I> constructions of
reality,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 of human freedom and (as Einstein repeatedly put
it) of


<B></B>


the almost miraculous potency of the human creative
imagination, squarely at the center of the definition of
science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 From the point of view of this mode of "humanism,"
devoted as it is to the licensing of an enriched, more freely speculative
pursuit of knowledge, the model of scientific rationality as the
instrument of the suppression of human narcissism has no place at all.

<P>
When I was a boy the New York <I>Daily Mirror</I> ran on its masthead the
injunction from John 8:32: "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall
make ye free." I was never too young to miss the irony of that statement
on a Hearst newspaper, but I felt it <I>as</I> an irony that didn't force
me to question the ideal the masthead affirmed. I didn't, however, know
then that the apostle John and William Hearst were affirming a fundamental
tenet of late-nineteenth-century positivism. The great Enlightenment
ideal, the commitment to knowledge and rationality as a means to
progressive improvement of the human condition, found one of its last
important outlets in positivism. Let me red-facedly admit that--despite a
lifetime of rebuffs--I have not given up that commitment.

<P>
Karl Pearson participated vigorously in it. In his 1892 <I>Grammar of
Science,</I> he virtually begins, in a section called "Science and
Citizenship," by asserting that the scientific "frame of mind seems to me
an essential of good citizenship."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
If this looks suspiciously
like science as the opiate of the masses, it may also be taken as a
good-faith commitment to the view that epistemology should be driven by
human needs. Put that way, it sounds not like scientific disingenuousness
but pragmatist revisionism. Surely, Pearson's explanation has some
contemporary resonance: "Every modern citizen," he says, "is thrust into
an appalling maze of social and educational problems." And every citizen
is "called upon to form a judgment apart, if it possibly may be, from his
own feelings and emotions--a judgment in what he conceives to be the
interests of society at large" (<I>GS,</I> 10).


<B></B>


 Here an Arnoldian
ideal of disinterest joins with positivist idealizing of knowledge.

<P>
<I>The Grammar of Science,</I> the most important summary of scientific
epistemology, method, and possibility since John Herschel's <I>Preliminary
Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy</I> of 1830, embraced both
the political and epistemological ideals of a new vision for science and
society. "The goal of science is clear," Pearson concludes; "it is nothing
short of the complete interpretation of the universe" (<I>GS,</I> 18).

<P>
Against this scientific imperialism it would be easy now to succumb to the
temptation to push once again the argument that scientific
thought--ostensibly disinterested and objective--disguises self-interest
and ideological complicity. Pearson was a propagandist for strong
pre-Vienna Circle positivist theory and at the same time one of the
most active and important of eugenicists. The connection makes itself.
There can be no mistaking that his major scientific initiatives were
ideologically driven by a passion for social reform, and a reform based on
a eugenic program of racial improvement.

<P>
I want to resist that temptation. I am interested in shaking up what may
be a current critical complacency latent in the idea that all knowledge is
political. Of course. And then what? In Pearson's case, for example, there
is the fact of "statistics." Statistics as a scientific discipline given
shape and direction by Pearson is an indispensable tool of modern life. J.
B. S. Haldane once remarked that Pearson's "theory of heredity was
incorrect in some fundamental respects. So was Columbus's theory of
geography. He set out for China, and discovered America."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It
is partly because of this apparently odd result--the growth of a valuable
science from an obviously ideologically driven enterprise--that I want to
think about the implications of his work for our own relations to
knowledge and science and politics. In addition, Pearson is a particularly
interesting subject because his theories raise echoes of contemporary
nonpositivist epistemological enterprises, and because his politics are
far more complicated--he was both socialist and feminist--than the
connection with eugenics first suggests. Pearson is, then, an ideal test
case for my tentative exploration of the possibility of recuperating some
aspects of the positivist enterprise, including certain elements of the
cognitive and something like an imagination of uncontaminated knowledge.

<P>
I don't propose, with Pearsonian hubris, to manage such a recuperation. At
best, I expect to complicate the picture: Pearson's kind of positivism
opens onto possibilities that many of us have been embracing and may
continue to embrace, both intellectually and politically.

<P>
I want, then, to go over some familiar ground about the positivist
epistemology that undergirded Pearson's idea of science, and to watch his
progress from citizenship to epistemic skepticism, to the possibility of
knowing. In doing so, I will be emphasizing aspects of his thought close
to current humanist critiques. And I do so because I believe that we have
tended to surrender too easily the value of some sort of rational and
cognitive consensus to the politically and intellectually conservative.
Positivism, certainly in the hands of Pearson, was an enterprise for human
betterment. Like all


<B></B>


such enterprises, it was therefore dangerous,
but no more so perhaps than our own anti-positivistic enterprises. It's
worth seeing where we connect with it and why it ended up in places that
have led to its dismissal.

<P>
Let me then recall that positivism, popularly conceived as dogmatic,
realistic, and fact-oriented, shares with the Nietzsche of Pearson's own
day a deep-rooted skepticism, and a perspectivist belief in the inevitable
human element buried in every "fact." It is initiated as much as a theory
of strong disbelief as of strong belief. "The improver of natural
knowledge," Huxley famously said, "absolutely refuses to acknowledge
authority as such. For him, scepticism is the highest of
duties."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The condition of strong belief is a preliminary
rejection of virtually everything one has believed. The word "positivism"
itself implies something of the Cartesian enterprise--the clearing away of
the debris of knowledge, all that is muddy and doubtable, not "clear and
distinct," for whatever foundational certainty one might find.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P>
But Pearson sought ways to resist the instability he believed in. The
movement through negations to aggressively affirmative modes of positivism
is a tricky one, based on fine description of the methods of science. Not
Cartesian in that he begins with a total commitment to empiricism, Pearson
replays Descartes's hunt for what it might be possible and necessary to
believe. He sustains at once a fundamental incredulity almost as complete
as Descartes's Great Doubt, and uses it to build a confident (if
stringently limited) way of knowing. Part of Pearson's program was the
absolute dismissal of traditional religion and metaphysics from the sphere
of knowledge; the other, "positive," part was the definition of a valid
mode of knowing.

<P>
Pearson tries to argue both that everything is in principle knowable and
that anything that lies outside sense impression is unknowable. This is a
particularly difficult maneuver, initiating the positivist strategy of
dismissing empirically indeterminable questions as nonsense, yet allowing
that maybe, yes, someday, we might know about reality. But we are too
ignorant to know whether we can know it. He finds the positive modes of
knowledge where we might expect, in science. "Wherever there is the
slightest possibility for the human mind to <I>know,</I> there is a
legitimate problem of science" (<I>GS,</I> 23). But, finally, to make
science valid on his terms and sweep up any metaphysical residue, he
rejects all claims that science is about reality.

<P>
Pearson's world is familiar to those who know Nietzsche's transformation
of knowledge into fiction. Kant's "thing in itself" is as much fiction to
Pearson as to Nietzsche; science is a mode of interpreting rather than a
representation of the real. Pearson argues that we know only our own
consciousnesses, that the world is in effect a construct of our
consciousness (where have we heard this before?). Strictly speaking, the
scientist discovers nothing: he is an inventor. The laws of nature owe
their existence to the creative power of man's intellect: "There is," says
Pearson, "more meaning in the statement that man gives laws to Nature than
in its converse that Nature gives law to man" (<I>GS,</I> 77). Pearson's
kind of positivism probably provided much of the intellectual ground for
the paradoxes of Oscar Wilde, who was unusually knowledgeable about
science, and a close reader of the naturalists, T. H.


<B></B>


Huxley, W. K.
Clifford, and John Tyndall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Here, in effect, Pearson says, as
Wilde would, that nature imitates art, not vice versa.

<P>
Pearson retreats from all large knowledge claims to one fundamental
recognition--not so much a cogito as a "sentio": I experience, therefore a
certain "routine of perception" (<I>GS,</I> 111, passim) exists. Routine
of perception is Pearson's antimetaphysically chilling formula for what
others might call reality, the regularity of impressions that allows the
mind to invent laws of nature. Scientists simply describe accurately and
economically the routine of those perceptions, through which it becomes
possible to infer past and future routines of perception. Such empiricist
orthodoxy threatens the very stability it seeks and entails further
recuperative moves. There are no "laws of nature," only descriptions of
routines of perception. This purging of reality and metaphysics leaves
positivism hovering over an abyss of nonknowing. (Note that the pragmatist
tradition shares intimately with this positivist one the refusal to allow
for science or language as "representation," particularly as
representation of some "reality" that lies outside of anyone's
consciousness.) For Pearson as for the pragmatists, we are all bound by
the egocentric predicament.

<P>
"Science," Pearson argues, "is in reality a classification and analysis of
the contents of the mind: and the scientific method consists in drawing
just comparisons and inferences from the stored impresses of past sense
impressions, and from the conceptions based on them" (<I>GS,</I> 49). Only
by making all knowledge claims pass through the narrow funnel of
individual consciousness can Pearson make the world safe from the
incursions of metaphysics. He thus moves himself, as so many of his
contemporaries moved, inside Pater's "thick wall . . . through which no
real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we
can only conjecture to be without."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P>
Yet Pearson's socialism entailed the belief that all individuals are bound
to and subsumed under the community; his epistemology made the same
requirement, for both moral and intellectual reasons. How, then, negotiate
an empiricist subjectivity that makes it impossible to get beyond the
self? Pearson, like many others at the time, including Wilde, Tyndall, and
even Nietzsche, adopts a strategy characteristic of strayed
foundationalists, the biologistic appeal to evolution.

<P>
Pearson replaces foundations with "normality." "The universal validity of
science depends," he says, "upon the similarity of the perceptive and
reasoning faculties in normal civilized men" (<I>GS,</I> 45); and for "a
conception to have scientific validity [it] must be <I>deducible</I> from
the perceptions of the normal human being" (<I>GS,</I> 50). Scientific
universality "has only meaning insofar as we refer to a certain type of
perceptive faculty, namely, that of a normal human being" (<I>GS,</I> 75).

<P>
The Foucauldian critique waits in the wings, but I defer it to get clear
how Pearson makes his epistemological maneuvers. Minds, he says, are
machines, and if they don't act adequately in response to stimulation, "we
say that the mind is disordered, the reason wanting, the person mad"
(<I>GS,</I> 88-89). Normality is, then, a power of evolutionary
survival. In an Erewhonian way, error becomes illness, and Pearson's
epistemology reaches out beyond mind to the body that seems to house it.
For the mad person, "The fitting exertion would not follow the sense
impression, and any


<B></B>


such man would have small chance of surviving
among men whose perceptive and reasoning faculties were attuned"
(<I>GS,</I> 91). Interestingly, in Wilde's notebooks there is an entry
under the heading <I>"Survival of Fittest in Thought"</I> that reads:
"Nature kills off all those who do not believe in the Uniformity of Nature
and the Law of Causation."

 Thus, with no access to other
people's minds, Pearson believes he can, with the concept of normality,
validate knowledge claims.

<P>
But another epistemological step, some antimetaphysical tool for knowing,
is required. The crucial instrument Pearson finds, learned of course from
Francis Galton, is "correlation." Things remain unknown, but a "sequence"
of impressions can be known. We will never find out what causes the
impressions, never get behind the screen of consciousness, and yet what we
find out will be enough to increase our chances of survival. Statistics,
in effect, becomes the basis of an antimetaphysical science in that it
allows the invention of laws to describe in the most economical possible
way the sequences of events--woops, impressions. If I experience this, I
am also likely to experience that. Such language replaces the idea of
cause, a word Pearson is willing to use only in a revised sense.
Probability contains the idea of "provability," as Pearson himself notes.
Taking into account the underdetermination of pure empirical evidence,
Pearson finds that statistics provides a convincing description of the
world, that is, of the routine. The "clear and distinct" of Descartes
gives way to "probability." Science moves from representation of reality
to statistical correlation. "Henceforward," he wrote, "the philosophical
view of the universe was to be that of a correlated system of variates,
approaching but by no means reaching perfect correlation, i. e., absolute
causality" (<I>GS,</I> 188). In <I>The Grammar of Science</I> the
metaphysics of causality becomes the science of correlation.

<P>
All of this is very clever. Yet, res don't lie, but liars re, and
we know that Pearson measured things for which he had totally inadequate
information; that he posited entities like normal mental acuity, for which
he had no justification; that he rejected Mendel's results in a
closed-minded and rather unscientific way. Even on the grounds of
conventional science, these can be detected as errors. But note in how
many different ways the idea of correlation and statistics satisfies
epistemological needs. Correlation makes no absolute claims about
relationship; it only registers that a relationship can be inferred. The
numbers used to establish correlation are comfortably free from the
personal, and the trick is only (a) to make sure you are counting the
right things, (b) to make sure you are asking the right questions in the
right way, and (c) to make sure that the mathematics is correct.
Correlative statistics seems to provide an algorithm for action and, as
William James would have seen it critically, precludes the one real
necessity, the need and responsibility to choose. But James's critique
does not preclude the necessity for shareable knowledge. And what I want
to emphasize here is Pearson's brilliant effort to construct the
shareable, rather than to insist on its adequacy.

<P>
When I first read Pearson I didn't know of his connections with eugenics,
and I followed the circuits of his argument without trying to resist.
Pearson's social goals were allied to his science because he believed that
true knowledge was attainable,


<B></B>


and that once attained it would carry
sufficient weight to guide political and moral action. Current strategies
of the critique of science manifest similar attempts to demonstrate a set
of facts (the incoherence of the narrative of ideal science, for example)
in order to produce social goals. Donna Haraway, for example, imagines a
science that would make "a no-nonsense commitment to faithful accounts of
a 'real' world, one that can be partially shared and friendly to
earth-wide projects of finite freedom, adequate material abundance, modest
meaning in suffering, and limited happiness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 I'm not trying
to equate Haraway and Pearson, but to call attention to a fundamental
similarity in their projects: science tries to provide the best possible
description of its subject in order to produce a social ideal. This is not
the normal way philosophers and scientists themselves talk about science
these days, yet the roll call of those who connect the project of science
with social goals is impressive--Francis Bacon, John Herschel, Huxley,
Pearson, Karl Popper, Bruno Latour, Haraway.

<P>
The usual idea that the intrusion of social and personal ambitions into
the working of science disrupts the possibility of disinterest and
therefore of true knowledge might well, as in Pearson's case, have it
backwards. Since there is no escaping the pressure of the subjective in
the act of knowing, the moral recognition of the primary need to confirm
knowledge with others and to sustain the larger community in conditions of
equity and fairness could in fact lead to the sorts of disciplined
restraint of the personal that could lend credibility to assertion.

<P>
The attempt to make statistics a perfect epistemological machine that
allows impersonality in a system otherwise inevitably biased was an
important enterprise in its effort--perhaps excessive--to get beyond the
personal, to discipline the desires, to penetrate the disguises of
ideology. That Pearson developed various statistical strategies through
his biometric work has not invalidated those strategies. That the
ingenuities of science have been touched by the pressures of money,
ambition, and social hierarchy has not diminished the importance of its
modes of knowing. Pearson's epistemology, the positivist ecstasy (or
effort to stand outside the self) and social critiques of science each
tend to set their sights far too high. They each assume that the only way
to achieve rational authority in knowledge is to distinguish radically the
knower from the act of knowing, and absolutely and austerely to refuse to
affirm any knowledge that lacks the authority of valid evidence, however
that may be defined. This is veritably a Cartesian standard of doubt, and
it exemplifies what Rom Harr&eacute; has called "the fallacy of 'high
redefinition.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
It is not clear to me that although beginning with several assumptions not
available to Pearson--that the eugenic project is an evil one, that
science has been driven in part at least by strong nonrational forces, and
that it has not been an unequivocal force for good--current strategies of
negotiating with skepticism and with the impossibility of ideal
self-repression are clearly an improvement on Pearson's. Ironically,
positivism and its enemies negotiate the same difficulties with the same
end: an ideal of valid, shareable, humanly usable knowledge. The excesses
of resistance to the inescapability of the partial in the projects of
knowledge and good citizenship do not negate the projects. It's not that
science and citizenship are oxymoronic, only that our


<B></B>


definitions
of these terms need modification in the light of ideas like Pearson's and
in the light of his failures.

<P>
Current strategies for negotiating with skepticism and with the
impossibility of self-repression are not self-evidently an improvement on
Pearson's. The ideal of disinterest still has work to do in our society.
The ideal of modest truth claims, connected to disinterest, has yet more
work to do.

<P>
For Pearson science, broadly, was rigorous thinking that makes the minimal
possible claims based on the fullest possible experience in order to
improve the quality of human life. I am not arguing for this epistemology,
but for a recognition of our continuing investment in his kind of
epistemology, for the importance of attempting to reaffirm the possibility
of human connection through rational understanding and knowledge, and our
responsibility for it.

Our America and Nativist Modernism:<BR>
A Panel</a>

<P>
<I>Our America</I> has two theses, one historical and one theoretical. The
historical thesis describes the emergence of a distinctly modern concept
of racial identity and its transformation--already implicit and never
complete--into the concept of cultural identity. The transformation is
never complete because culture, imagined not as our actual beliefs and
practices but as the beliefs and practices that are appropriate for us,
can never free itself from race; the transformation is always implicit
because race presents itself from the start as a kind of ideal, something
we must not only embody but live up to. What <I>Our America</I> calls
nativist modernism is the literature of this transformation and of the
dramas of identity it makes possible: the betrayal of your culture and the
recovery of your culture, the effort to become yourself and the struggle
to remain yourself. <I>Our America</I> understands both the characteristic
thematic ambitions of American modernism (e. g., for "the family" to
maintain itself) and its characteristic formal ambitions (e. g., for the
poem to be itself) as expressions of these identitarian commitments. The
theoretical thesis is that any notion of cultural identity that goes
beyond the description of our actual beliefs and practices must rely on
race (or something equivalent, say, sex) in order to determine which
culture is actually ours. Hence the idea of cultural identity--despite the
fact that in recent years it has customarily been presented as an
alternative to racial identity--is in fact, not only historically but
logically, an extension of racial identity.

<P>
Marjorie Perloff, Robert von Hallberg, and Charles Altieri focus most of
their attention on the historical thesis. They argue that it is at best
only partially true, which is to say, true


<B></B>


only of a few major
modernist writers and not entirely true even of them. They also think that
modernism as a movement is diminished by my account of its social meaning;
indeed they think that the value of literature itself is diminished by my
account of modernism's social meaning. Perloff and Altieri also disagree
with the theoretical thesis. Perloff defends the idea of racial/cultural
identity on the social constructionist grounds that "identity is largely a
question of how others perceive us" ; Altieri defends the idea of
cultural heritage (racial/cultural identity in its historicist mode) on
the grounds that it can function as a purely "educational" concept without
a "racial basis" .

<P>
Neither of the theoretical objections seems to me to have much force.
Perloff apparently thinks that because the critique of identity "cut no
ice" with the Nazis we should accept what "the history of our brutal
century has taught us, identity is largely a question of how others
perceive us" . But, even leaving aside the particular question of why
the Nazis' commitment to the primacy of identity should count as an
argument in its favor, Perloff's idealism is both theoretically incoherent
(the belief that people belong to races is not in itself evidence that
people belong to races) and politically disabling (what grounds would we
have for criticizing the Nazis if we didn't think that their perceptions
of Jewish identity were <I>mistaken</I>). Altieri doesn't think we can
save cultural identity simply by validating everyone's mistakes and
accepting Perloff's criteria (if somebody thinks you are something, then
["largely"] you are the thing they think you are); he thinks we can save
it by understanding it neither as racial entitlement nor as shared beliefs
but as "shareable competencies" . Thus where I argue that
Shakespeare's belonging to our cultural heritage can only be a consequence
of rather than a motive for our reading him (if we do, he will; if we
don't, he won't), Altieri says that, "so long as we teach literature,"
"anyone whose interests are directed toward such materials will profit
from trying Shakespeare" ; to encourage people to try Shakespeare, he
thinks, is thus to encourage them "to try out identifications with a
heritage even if there is no racial basis for the identification" .
But how does being interested in a subject (literature) get turned into
(or equated with) identifying with a heritage? No one will deny that if
you're interested in literature it's useful to know something about
Shakespeare, but the point of appeals to cultural heritage is not, of
course, to find new words to describe peoples' cultural interests. It is
to identify those things that count as part of your culture <I>whether or
not</I> you are interested in them.

<P>
The historical objections seem to me more serious. For if modernism, as
Perloff plausibly says, "does not . . . belong to the United States alone"
, any attempt to insist upon its national and even nationalist
character may look dubious,
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 and so a certain proportion of
these responses is devoted to reminding me that there were important
modernist writers who were not American nativists. But the undeniable
truth of this assertion does not in itself gainsay my claim that many
American modernists were; more interestingly, it does not address the
question of the relation between international modernism and the
increasing prominence of racial identity


<B></B>


as a meaningful social
category in, most obviously, France and Germany, but not insignificantly
in Britain, Italy, and (with allowances for the dramatic changes produced
by the revolution) in Russia as well. Which is just to say that, although
my respondents tend to think of the international character of modernism
as counting against my insistence on the primacy of race/culture (von
Hallberg says that my nativist modernism is "much more nativist than
modernist" because the "connections" of my authors to international trends
are "faint" [115]), the truth may be just the opposite--what may be most
international about international modernism is its involvement with those
categories of identity that have played such a central and often dominant
role in European history throughout the twentieth century. From this
standpoint, it would be precisely my authors' obsession with a racialized
Americanness that would mark most clearly their participation in modernism
as an international movement.

<P>
This does not mean, of course, that international modernism should be
understood as a collection of local nativisms on the American model.
Modern American nativism, as I describe it, is essentially
anti-imperialist, originating in the representation of the resistance to
Reconstruction as the resistance to empire and deploying its pluralist
racism against the very idea that people of different cultures could be
ruled by the same government. Nothing could be less true of racism in
England or, indeed, of the racial commitments of writers like Ezra Pound
and T. S. Eliot whose literary ambitions, it is traditionally argued, were
formed in London before the war. Perloff thinks "a consideration of
Pound's or Eliot's nativism" would have usefully complicated my argument
 but my argument is that Pound and Eliot <I>weren't</I> nativists,
and that their anti-pluralism produced racial commitments very different
from (if no less racist than) those of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest
Hemingway. More generally, although it is true that the emergence of
modernism is linked almost everywhere to the rise of race-based modes of
social organization, it does not follow that these modes were everywhere
the same: anti-Semitism in France, for example, was deployed in the
mobilization of a mass politics; in the U. S., it tended to express a
certain hostility to the very idea of mass culture (Negrophobia did the
work of racializing "the people"). Marcel Proust is not Gertrude Stein,
and it would be a mistake to think that what Jewishness meant to the
author of <I>The Making of Americans</I> was the same as what it meant to
the author of <I>Du c&ocirc;t&eacute; de chez Swann.</I> But it would also
be a mistake to think that the question of identity was irrelevant to
either.

<P>
Of course, one might still argue, as von Hallberg does, that "literary
history is better justified" when "it records some deviance from social,
political, and institutional history" , and thus that literary
history should focus its attention on those modernists who were critical
of the primacy of race/culture. He finds this critical deviance
exemplified in William Carlos Williams's commitment to hybridity instead
of purity, as in P&egrave;re Rasles's "will 'TO MARRY . . . to hybridize,
to crosspollenize' with the North American continent and its Indian
inhabitants" . But, even setting aside for a moment the question of
how to understand this commitment to hybridization,


<B></B>


 it should be
clear that the demonstration that a writer like Williams was committed to
hybridity instead of purity cannot really count against a description of
modernism that insists on the absolute centrality of the categories of a
racialized identity. In an important sense, it does not matter for my
argument whether an individual writer prefers racial hybridity to racial
purity or vice versa. What matters is that these are the relevant choices.
Thus when Altieri insists that "the gulf between Faulkner and his
characters requires us to postulate within modernist culture more than one
attitude toward these racial matters" (108-9), he seems to me (about
the "attitude" if not the "gulf") exactly right. There are indeed
differences in "attitude" between modernist writers and the point of
<I>Our America</I> is not to deny those differences; it is instead to
describe the logic according to which it is precisely those differences
(differences about "racial matters") that are the ones that matter. They
aren't the ones that mattered to Edith Wharton or Henry James.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P>
Whether these differences amount to the deviance called for by von
Hallberg is another question. Von Hallberg thinks that <I>In the American
Grain</I> is distinguished from more "romanticized"  texts by
P&egrave;re Rasles's will "TO MARRY" the Indians but--from Hart Crane to
D. H. Lawrence to Robinson Jeffers to Zane Grey--no event in the nativist
canon was more frequent than sex with an Indian. Although von Hallberg's
equation of "miscegenation" with the impulse "'to hybridize'" seems
plausible enough, what the fantasy of sleeping with truly native Americans
seemed in fact to offer was hybridization <I>without</I> miscegenation, a
way of legitimizing rather than problematizing one's Americanness. To see
the point here, one has only to note the relative absence of romantic
fantasies about crosspollenizing with Jews. Tom Outland, in <I>The
Professor's House,</I> imagines himself descended from Indians and so
imagines the Anasazi relics he has discovered as belonging to his
family--the American family. Roddy Blake, by contrast, sells the relics
and thus betrays his country, "like Dreyfus."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 And Louie
Marsellus marries the sister who should have married Tom, thus
guaranteeing that the Professor's descendants will be Jewish, not Indian.
The desire to "hybridize" with Indians was the desire to make your
children as native as their native American parent and thus to make
yourself--the parent of a native American--as American as your children.

<P>
Needless to say, most of this sex was, as Altieri would say, "of a
distinctly metaphoric kind" . Altieri seems to think that this is a
problem, that unless these writers "based specific political decisions" on
the "identifications" I describe , there is nothing political about
them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 But it's hard to see why writing books that reimagine
American history and reconstruct a national poetic along lines that
articulate the principles of Calvin Coolidge (which is, if I am right,
what William Carlos Williams was doing between 1923 and 1929) counts as
less political than actually voting for Calvin Coolidge. It is, of course,
precisely what they see as this reduction of the literary to the political
that most concerns all three of my respondents; they think that it makes
literature, or at least the study of literature, unnecessary: "For why do
we need to study literature in order to learn about the identity politics
of the 1920s?"  Perloff asks, "Surely there are more informative and
efficient ways than to read


<B></B>


dozens of what are largely
undistinguished novels" . Here their defense of modernism becomes the
defense of the literary as such, and we are confronted with an
opposition--between literature and history or "cultural studies"--that the
New Criticism made foundational for the modern discipline of literary
criticism (an opposition that many on the "cultural studies" side would no
doubt find just as gratifying--the fact that 's
respondents all take the literature side has an easy, but for the issues
under discussion here, irrelevant institutional explanation). But,
whatever the ultimate theoretical merit of this opposition may be, the
texts discussed in <I>Our America</I> make immediately clear certain of
its more obvious limitations. Does Faulkner's attempt to imagine the
transformation of words into things belong to literature or to history?
If, on the one hand, nothing is more characteristic of the literary
ambition of modernism than its effort to overcome reference, its effort to
make the words <I>be</I> the things rather than <I>refer</I> to them,
nothing, on the other hand, is more characteristic of the social history
of modernity than the emergence of the identitarian project of being
yourself. Indeed, the invention of the various dramas of identity that I
describe--betraying one's identity or defending it, repudiating it or
recovering it--is unimaginable and probably would have been impossible
without literary modernism's various idealizations of its own
literariness, which is to say, of the quintessentially identitarian
question of the text's relation to itself.

<P>
Robert von Hallberg opens this discussion by saying that <I>Our
America</I> describes American modernism as "driven by considerations of
race and identity more than of form and representation" . But <I>Our
America</I> argues that questions of race and identity <I>are</I>
questions of form and representation, and, although the converse need not
be true--although questions of form and representation need not be
understood as questions of race--<I>Our America</I> argues that in
modernism they were, that what distinguishes modernism is precisely its
understanding of questions of form and representation as questions of race
and identity. Maybe we should describe modernism as something like the
research-and-development division of identitarianism. In any event, just
as I don't think you can understand literary modernism without
understanding its participation in the production of identitarianism, I
don't think you can understand modern identitarianism without
understanding literary modernism. The real reductionism is in thinking
that you can somehow separate the two.

I am grateful to the editors of <I>Modernism / Modernity</I> for arranging

But not, Perloff to the contrary notwithstanding, even"inadvertently
racist" . The redescription of American national
identity as American racial identity was, no doubt, the fondest dream of
American nativists, but Perloff is mistaken in thinking that this dream
has been fulfilled.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT2" HREF="#REF2">2</a>.
This may be an opportune moment to point out that I don't in factthink
that their indifference to or ignorance of the uses of racial
identity make Wharton and James less great writers. And, although Perloff
characterizes me as "an anti-aestheticist" , I agree with her that
some works of art are better than others. It is, of course, a little
disconcerting to be lectured on aesthetic value by someone who thinks that
Charles Bernstein is a major poet, but the fact that Perloff herself can
only occasionally tell the difference between a good poem and a bad one
doesn't mean that she isn't right to maintain that there is a difference.

In a similar vein, Altieri suggests that the changes I describe inthe
meaning of citizenship, changes embodied in my juxtaposition of the
Immigration and the Indian Citizenship Acts, cannot be understood simply
by a reading of the relevant texts. Indeed, he argues that "the very
effort to establish commonness on the level of what these pieces of
legislation meant for people requires overlooking the economic factors
that are central in establishing different experiences of citizenship"
. But the question here is not only about how people experienced
citizenship but about what citizenship was: was it still, in the wake of
the various technologies that had been invented to reconre it, the
sort of thing that could be or should be acquired? And the answer to this
question does not depend on the different economic circumstances of the
various groups in American society; indeed, it was a crucial aspect of
nativist modernism that it substituted the question of what your
nationality was for the question of what your socioeconomic status was,
that it substituted race and culture for class. The "commonness" between
the Johnson Act and the Citizenship Act thus has nothing to do with some
presumed commonness between Indians and immigrants; it has everything to
do with common commitment of congressmen and writers to imagining the
desire to succeed as the desire to pass, to reimagining Clyde Griffiths's
desire to have more money as Jimmie Gatz's desire to be Jay Gatsby.

British and American modernist poets shared a preoccupation with the
importance of speech to poetry--and conversely, of poetry to speech. As T.
S. Eliot put it in "Little Gidding": "our concern was speech, and speech
impelled us / To purify the dialect of the tribe."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 He
approximates Dante's terza rima in the <I>Divine Comedy </I>to describe an
encounter with the shade of a past master--perhaps W. B. Yeats, or Dante
himself--who underscores this ideal of the poet's relationship to the
spoken language. For Eliot, then, the poet expands the expressive capacity
of common speech; like Dante in the <I>Divine Comedy, </I>he writes in the
"middle style" to purify the "vernacular" of the day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Ezra
Pound, in his first prose work, <I>The Spirit of Romance </I>, paid
careful attention to Dante's <I>De Vulgari Eloquentia, </I>in which Dante
affirms poetry written in the common speech. As Pound would later attempt
in the <I>Cantos, </I>Dante imagines poets creating an ideal version of
the vernacular, borrowing elements from different regional dialects to
create a precise and concise language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Yeats, in the decades
preceding both Pound's and Eliot's migrations to London, had similarly
sought to rid poetic language of abstraction and rhetoric in favor of the
clarity and naturalness of "living speech" through experiments with
Anglo-Irish dialect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 He tried not to write dialect verse, but
instead a poetry that sounded as natural as the spoken word.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

And, across the ocean, William Carlos Williams pursued a poetry free of
"poetic" language and European traditions--an American poetry based on the






American spoken word: "It is in the newness of a live speech that
the new line exists undiscovered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P>
This article gives the orientation toward speech of modernist poetry, with
its emphasis on the oral (as opposed to the visual), a social
context.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 I will turn to the sociology of culture to examine
the important social role of elocution teaching and the verse-recitation
movement in late Victorian and Edwardian England. Following Pierre
Bourdieu, who characterizes the aesthetic disposition of the contemporary
French cultural elite (those who affirm the autonomy of the aesthetic) as
that of the "pure gaze,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 I will suggest that the culturally
legitimating marker of distinction in middle- and upper-class London
before World War I was, indeed, the "pure voice." This context helps
elucidate modernist critical and aesthetic categories like those that
preoccupied Eliot in his early criticism--the purity of language,
impersonality, and verse drama--and historicizes their role in the public
emergence of modernist poetry. Bourdieu suggests that "art and cultural
consumption are predisposed, consciously and deliberately or not, to
fulfil a social function of legitimating social differences" (<I>D,</I>
6-7). I will argue that Victorian elocution and recitation practices,
which initially served the clergy, barristers, M. P.'s, and other male
members of the privileged classes who envisioned a career involving public
speaking, evolved into a much more elaborate and widespread vehicle of
cultural reproduction, legitimation, and distinction for the male <I>and
</I>female upper <I>and </I>middle classes. The new elocution, with its
emphasis on verse recitation, had its own institutions of consecration and
professionalization, the support of a profitable corner of the publishing
industry, and a growing presence in official pedagogy. The
verse-recitation movement, which was both part of liberal-education reform
trends and a response to class anxieties that were partially caused by
those same reforms, privileged oral cultural production over visual
spectacle, which it associated with artifice, theatricality,
and--especially--the working-class music hall.

<P>
To open out this notion of pure voice and its role in modernist
aesthetics, I will examine the nexus of modernist poetry and
<I>avant-guerre </I>class anxieties via a strange dual text--the
copublication (as a single magazine) of Harold Monro's <I>The Poetry
Review </I>, an important organ for the aesthetic innovations of
both Georgian and modernist poets,
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 and <I>The Poetical
Gazette, </I>the journal of the aesthetically moribund and conservative
Poetry Society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 With this copublication and its successor,
<I>Poetry and Drama </I>(1913-14), Harold Monro published and
disseminated the work of poets ranging from John Masefield to Ezra Pound
and F. T. Marinetti. The Poetry Society, as an institution of the
verse-recitation movement, both influenced young modernist poets and
provided an opportunity for them to use public performance to seek wider
audiences and help popularize experimental verse. Ideas of purity of
diction, impersonality, and verse drama that were discussed in the
magazine became important modernist aesthetic imperatives, but each of
these issues at this early period was involved in creating a public
dimension for modernist poetry. Modernist poets challenged the power of
the conservative Poetry Society to consecrate its own poetic taste, and
thus used the cultural legitimacy of the pure voice to produce the value



<B></B>


 and cultural meaning of aesthetic experiments. Adopting and modifying
contemporary verse-recitation practices and commonplaces, Monro created
the Poetry Bookshop as a center for the oral performance of poetry by
poets ranging from the most conservative to the most
avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 This was an important precursor of the immensely
popular public readings later in the century by Dylan Thomas,
trans-Atlantic visitors like Allen Ginsberg, and even young working-class
poets at the poetry festivals of the 1960s and 1970s;
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 the
Poetry Bookshop's performances adapted class-based verse-recitation
paradigms to emphasize the power of oral recitation to convey an
understanding of formal experimentation. Above all, the Poetry Bookshop
brought poetry readings out of the Victorian parlor and in front of the
public.

<B>Elocution and Verse Recitation</B>

</H3>

<P>
Around the turn of the century, the proliferation of elocution and
recitation manuals targeting ever-broader audiences, along with the
professionalization of speech-training and its expanded role in the
education system, attested to the increasing social and cultural
importance of the speaking voice to British culture. New discourses about
proper diction and verse recitation foregrounded the role of a newly
emphasized pure voice in bourgeois self-legitimation and cultural
reproduction.

<P>
Victorian elocution manuals and public-speaking primers, even as late as
the 1870s and 1880s, were frequently written by clergy holding university
positions and were aimed at the university-educated upper- and
upper-middle-class males who would be pursuing careers involving public
speaking.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 For instance, a manual published in 1874 by the
Reverend J. J. Halcombe, M. A., Rector of Balsham, Cambridge, and W. H.
Stone, M. A., M. D., of Balliol, was explicitly aimed at "the younger
members of the Universities, in the confident hope that the subjects of
which they treat will soon be recognised in their full importance by every
man who is looking forward to serve in the Christian
ministry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Halcombe suggested readings for
discussion--Junius, Cicero, Demosthenes--while foregrounding the role of a
classical education in precise verbal understanding.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 The
manual provided exercises for the young scholars who had not yet developed
such proficiency in the classics, but was obviously aimed at the
university-bound upper classes.

<P>
Dr. Stone's portion was also typical of mid-Victorian elocution books in
that he looked to an emerging physiological science of the throat, lungs,
and mouth to provide helpful speaking aids. But even Dr. Stone admitted
that "speech is by no means a 'natural' function in the usual sense of the
word. It is a complex and difficult acquirement, perfected through many
centuries in the course of progressive civilisation" that the
"intellectual community of the ages . . . must pass on" (<I>SH,</I> 153).
Such manuals did not naturalize the attainments of public speaking; they
instead clearly viewed their educated elite male audiences as bearers of a
cultural heritage preserved from the ancient Greeks. Demosthenes was the
model, and the future leaders of England were the audience.


<B></B>

<P>
However, by the later Victorian and Edwardian periods a change was
occurring in the publication strategies of elocution and recitation
manuals. They began to aim at a far broader audience than had the
technical tomes of high Victorian elocutionary technique. Herbert
Jennings's <I>Voice and Its Natural Development </I> began, "The
present volume is compiled expressly for the busy man and woman who have
little leisure time to bestow in rudimentary and arduous study"; he
intended to "deal in a practical manner with vocal
development."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Elocution was now not just for the leisured
class, but also for the busy and less-educated middle class. In <I>The
Speaking Voice: Principles of Training Simplified and Condensed
</I>, Katherine Jewell Everts likewise noted that "there are volumes
of recognized authority, considerable in length and exhaustive in detail,
which one who intends to use his voice professionally should master, if
possible, but which it is almost impossible for the college, society, or
business man or woman to study and follow, from sheer lack of
time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
The appeal of elocution, or vocal training, was
broadening beyond the male elite confines of Oxbridge to include larger
numbers of both men and women of the non-university-bound bourgeoisie.

<P>
Furthermore, these later elocution and recitation manuals began to employ
new discourses that suggest middle-class anxieties about cultural
reproduction and legitimacy. They reveal an attempt to naturalize "proper"
speaking, to elide the explicit class basis of the earlier manuals. Canon
Fleming's <I>The Art of Reading and Speaking </I> asserted that "It
is an art which, with all its refinement, belongs to no particular class
to the exclusion of others," and he urged his readers to "Speak so
naturally that your words may go from the heart to the heart, and that
people may forget the messenger while they listen to the
message."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Fleming also brought up a theme that was to be a
rallying cry for many elocution books: an attack upon the "artificiality"
of elocution rules in favor of a practice that is "to make none artificial
or stilted, but to help all to be natural and real."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 These
manuals rejected the rules and gestures prescribed by earlier elocution
systems, but they also implied that the speech of the educated middle and
upper classes was "natural," thus clearly reinforcing distinctions at a
pedagogical level that accent and dialect had preserved between the
classes in England for centuries. The expanding bourgeoisie was
universalizing its language in a strategy of self-legitimation.

<P>
Modernist hopes to "purify the dialect of the tribe" thus emerged in
England against the backdrop of a class-based sociocultural movement.
Middle-class strategies of legitimation could involve an appeal to a
linguistic nationalism, but within a "classless" paradigm gesturing at
pedagogical reforms. Jennings wrote,

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Purity of diction is the birthright of every English man and woman, and it
is largely due to the indifference shown in educational administration at
home and at school that our mother-tongue has been robbed of its grandeur
and beauty of tone. If only justice were done to the English language, it
would not only hold its own in sweetness and musical distinction, but, if
we accept the verdict of a celebrated German philologist, it also
possesses "a veritable power of expression and comprehension unsurpassed
by any language on earth--whether ancient or modern."

<P>
The grandeur of the nation depended upon vigilance against impurity,
which, of course, implied the dialects of the working classes. The
attainment of pure voice was not just a social grace or a career
requirement for the upper classes, as the Victorian manuals had
emphasized, but a broader marker of cultural legitimacy and distinction
for the middle classes.

<P>
This heightened concern with the purity of English speech arose as the
English school system expanded and reached out to more working-class
children.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In 1870 the Forster Act had made government
responsible for education when voluntary efforts were insufficient, thus
continuing earlier trends toward broad literacy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In a move
applauded by Matthew Arnold himself, educational reformers also introduced
"English literature" into the curriculum for the first time in 1871 and
called for the memorization of lines of poetry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 The Board
Schools opened educational opportunities that helped many rise up the
class ladder; I'll suggest, however, that the expansion of the educational
system, which dramatically increased during the Edwardian period, helped
fuel class anxieties that metamorphosed into an emphasis on speech
training in the school system, on reading the "proper" set of English
literary works, and on the professionalization of elocution.

<P>
The class anxieties lying hidden beneath school reforms, and especially
the English literature curriculum, were stated explicitly by Henry
Newbolt, a vice president of the Poetry Society, a prominent literary
critic, and an occasional reader at the Poetry Bookshop. Appearing soon
after World War I, the famous Newbolt Report, <I>The Teaching of English
in England </I>, resulted from the lobbying efforts of the English
Association, which Brian Doyle characterizes as "a class-based
mobilisation which drew in not only most professors of English Language
and Literature, but also like-minded politicians, administrators, and
men-of-letters."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Compiled for the government by Newbolt and
other primarily upper-middle-class Public School-educated men, the
report noted:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Literature, in fact, seems to be classed by a large number of thinking
working men with antimacassars, fish-knives and other unintelligible and
futile trivialities of "middle class" culture, and, as a subject of
instruction, is suspect as an attempt to "sidetrack the working-class
movement." . . . We were told . . . working men felt any attempt to teach
them literature or art was an attempt to impose on them the culture of
another class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The report revealed a fear of the utilitarian uses to which the working
classes might put their education: "They see education mainly as something
to equip them to t their capitalistic enemies," and cautioned that if
the working classes remained alienated from the dominant culture, England
might soon encounter "the hostility toward capitalism now prevalent in
Bolshevist Russia" (<I>TE,</I> 254). Against the threat to the middle
class posed by an educated working class, the report urged public schools
to emphasize an agenda of enculturation through education "based upon the
English language and literature" (<I>TE,</I> 21).

<P>
Among the things the report saw as dividing the classes was "a marked
difference in their modes of speech" (<I>TE,</I> 22). It argued that
"pride in the national language


<B></B>


would be a bond of union between
classes, and would beget the right kind of national pride. Even more
certainly should pride and joy in the national literature serve as such a
bond" (<I>TE,</I> 22). The rhetoric raised the specter of international
Communism that, of course, would have inspired fear in the middle and
upper classes. However, Newbolt proposed a national and class unity that
affirmed, naturalized, and institutionalized middle-class markers of
distinction: speech and literary taste. The Newbolt Report was only a
systematic statement of attitudes that had been developing since the late
Victorian period.

<P>
The focus of anxiety about the Board Schools was not just the students'
critical abilities, but their speech and the role of reading aloud in the
schools (the subject of a set of Education Department circulars published
in 1898). One circular lamented the poor job elementary schools were doing
in teaching expressive reading and articulation. It complained that "there
are too few signs in reading aloud of the individuality of expression
which we call 'intelligence.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Another circular sent to the
Training Colleges and Pupil-Teacher Centres complained of the lack of
progress in teaching pupils to read aloud, partially because the
pupil-teachers themselves were generally not taught sufficiently
(<I>CS,</I> 156-57). In other words, the faults in diction and
pronunciation of the lower- or lower-middle-class participants in the
Pupil-Teacher Centres were reproduced in the "unintelligent" dialects of
their students.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 One prominent member of the English
Association in 1909 cautioned against the influence of the "debased
dialect of the Cockney . . . which is spreading from our schools and
training-colleges all over the country. In ten years' time the English
language will not be worth speaking."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 The Newbolt Report
recommended training in voice and diction in the Teacher Training
Colleges, and called for oral examinations to judge the results
(<I>TE,</I> 178-79).

<P>
These class-based anxieties gathered momentum during the Edwardian
expansion of the school system. Liberal reforms in 1907 created free
secondary schooling and linked primary and secondary education by
requiring 25 percent of the free places in secondary education to be
reserved for pupils recruited from the public elementary schools ("S,"
153). Almost immediately, though, the 1908 Board of Education Report
strongly criticized the standards of the teaching of English in secondary
schools.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 New schools and programs emerged to deal with the
problems of literary appreciation and, simply, of speech; the Central
School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, which taught speech and
trained drama teachers, for example, was founded in 1906 by Elsie Fogerty,
who attached great importance to verse recitation in her
program.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The University of London and other adult educational
institutions also offered courses to remedy "improper" speaking. Because
the development of the pure voice was not simply a matter of public
speaking, but rather part of a larger defensive strategy of cultural
legitimation--exemplified by the Newbolt Report--it led to an emphasis on
verse recitation and linked speech training to the teaching of English
literature. By the late Victorian period, elocution had moved from the
practical concerns of creating polished orators for the pulpit and
parliament, and had


<B></B>


become a "fine art" connected to the experience
of literature, thus shifting the means by which elocution served as a
marker of social attainment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P>
New ideas about reading verse aloud that were to be crucial to early
modernist poets drew the notion of the pure voice into the discourse about
the interpretation and appreciation of poetry, and about the role of
impersonality in recitation. Alison Byerly suggests that the Victorians
distrusted the theater, that acting and the visual trappings of
theatricality--dressing up as another character and assuming its
persona--were associated with deception or duplicity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 This
apprehension was circumvented by reading drama aloud with the entire
family at home, safe from the shadowy and disreputable theaters
themselves.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The problem of losing oneself (and especially
one's moral responsibility) in a role was overcome by the overriding
presence and personality of the dramatic reader who read multiple
parts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 However, the logic of the pure voice, as it related to
verse recitation in the 1890s and the Edwardian period, led readers to
almost the opposite extreme.

<P>
The prevalent critique of the artificiality of gesture and vocalization of
Victorian elocution in favor of something more "natural" developed, in
manuals specifically aimed at verse recitation, into the understanding
that reading aloud helped to elucidate the true meaning of the poem,
allowing a "surrender" to the personality of the poet or even to the poem
itself. Against the "extravagance in speech and gesture, studied poses,
artificial exaggeration of simple emotions, wooden and vulgar presentation
of what is sweetest, noblest, and most delicate in our literature:
inferior imitation of the third rate stage" (<I>CS,</I> 88), Arthur
Burrell, Senior Master at the Bradford Grammar School, proclaimed that
"Intelligent expression may be taken to mean such modulation of the voice
as correctly interprets the meanings of a writer for a hearer" (<I>CS,</I>
151). Bertha Skeat emphasized the presence of the author during oral
performance: "in trying to express aloud the best thoughts of others in
the best way, we enter almost unconsciously into their
spirit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Hardress O'Grady put it more explicitly, calling
reading aloud "a road to the personality of the writer" (<I>RA,</I> 1). He
explained:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What we read silently cannot possess the same value as that which we read
aloud. The music and the rhythm are obscured, they are heard as in a dream
darkly . . . but if, when we are making the acquaintance of new work, we
use the instrument that Nature has given us, the whole beauty of prose or
verse shall spring alive. By a magic within the reach of any of us we
shall see the writer's self face to face. [<I>RA,</I> 3]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
"We put ourselves," he added, "in direct communication with the inner mind
of the writer" (<I>RA,</I> 119). Everts proclaimed that reading verses
aloud allowed the reader to "catch the spirit of the creator of
them."

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
In the previous section, we saw that the practices of elocution and verse
recitation in middle-class culture positioned oral performance as a
component of literary


<B></B>


appreciation. In their development of an ideal
of authorial presence mediated by the reciter, they were paving the way
for the modernist poets to take the leap into the phenomenon of public
poetry readings--given by the poets themselves. The culmination of the
trends in verse recitation, with their direct links to modernist poets,
was the Poetry Recital Society, founded in 1909 in London. The Poetry
Society, as it came to be called, attempted to institutionalize and
professionalize the discourses of elocution and recitation, to attain the
power of consecrating taste and "culture," and to influence the London
school system's efforts at verse recitation. In short, the Poetry Society
helped to enhance the legitimation of the pure voice that so many manuals
had been approaching as a marker of cultural, and hence social,
distinction. And, most importantly for my purposes, despite being a
culturally conservative foe of emerging modernist poets, the Poetry
Society helped to provide a unique opportunity for them to bring their
work before the public.

<P>
Lady Margaret Sackville's inaugural address epitomized the Poetry
Society's goals for recitation. She continued the recent attacks on the
artificiality and visual spectacle of elocution: "I believe as little
gesture should be used as possible, and that, as a rule, the voice alone,
provided it is flexible enough, is sufficiently effective. The speaking of
verse is not acting."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Sackville also adhered to the (now
common) explanation that the relationship between the reader's personality
and the poem or even the poet distinguished bad elocution from the proper
speaking of verse: "There should be no striving from outside to produce a
definite effect--the soul of the interpreter should be so possessed by the
poem that it follows it instinctively in every modulation and inflection
as easily as water flows between winding banks" ("AS," 454).
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P>
This inaugural address enunciated not only the philosophy and goals of the
Poetry Society, but also a system of cultural production that allowed the
speaker with the proper "temperament" ("AS," 456) and cultural capital to
accrue symbolic value through the act of oral performance: "To my mind the
proper rendering of a poem requires an attitude of surrender on the part
of the speaker, and he must certainly possess a power of emotion equal to
that contained in the poem itself" ("AS," 455). This cultural capital
consisted of the pure voice--gained through class privilege in addition to
the professional training and credentials meted out by the Poetry
Society--and an education in the culturally consecrated poetic taste of
the middle- and upper-middle classes. Sackville ascribes to the reciter
the emotional power and cultural prestige of the author. Significantly,
the marker of distinction was always the voice, the one thing that would
be almost impossible for a working-class reciter to emulate. In a popular
lecture given at many of the Poetry Society Centers, Sturge Moore even
argued that poetry only existed when audible, and that a "curtain to hide
the speaker and reduce him as nearly as possible to a voice" would
facilitate the proper reception of a poetry reading.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P>
The Poetry Society buttressed its legitimacy with a number of different
exclusionary tactics and markers of distinction. It used the prestige of
the dominant classes to advertise itself, printing in almost every issue
of the <I>Gazette </I>its list of important


<B></B>


titled and degreed
personages who were its numerous vice presidents, patrons, and honorary
members. These included nobility, professors, doctors, clergy,
elocutionists, and literary luminaries of the Edwardian period, including
Theodore Watts-Dunton, W. M. Rossetti, Edmund Gosse, Maurice Hewlett, G.
K. Chesterton, John Galsworthy, Arnold Bennett, Sturge Moore, and Newbolt.
The Society banked with Barclay's, and, to display its respect for sound
financial acumen, it even had its own Honorary Auditor. This list was
regularly headed with the caption "Founded as the Poetry Recital Society
to promote a more general recognition and appreciation of Poetry by
encouraging the public and private reading of it and developing the art of
speaking verse." However, the public dimension of the Poetry Society was
in fact a restricted one, especially when compared to the Penny Reading
movement of the mid-Victorian period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Membership in the
Poetry Society would have been fairly expensive to the working or
lower-middle classes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Most of the events were free or
inexpensive to members, but nonmembers had to pay extra charges of at
least one shilling to attend.

<P>
Like the Penny Reading movement, the Poetry Society assembled an
organization to train readers and arrange events, but a key difference was
that the Penny Reading organizers chose material that would be the most
entertaining to their diverse audiences. At Penny Readings, poetry was
only infrequently read, and humorous or entertaining prose anecdotes were
the usual fare.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The Poetry Society meetings, of course,
centered around poetry and, importantly for modernists, they also valued
verse drama, even forming a Poetic Drama Society, whose activities were
regularly covered in the <I>Gazette</I>'s pages. The poetry that the
Society recited and discussed was almost always that of the consecrated
Victorian greats--Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, Rossetti--and frequently
also Longfellow, Shakespeare, and the Elizabethans. The taste it enforced
was "high-brow," but of the bourgeois sort, not necessarily that of the
university-educated elite. For instance, many of the members were women,
who usually lacked a classical education. Almost all of the authors read
were English, rather than Greek or Roman, and when the Poetry Society
tackled a classical project, like its much-touted production of
<I>Hippolytus, </I>they used Gilbert Murray's translation, looked to his
advice for understanding the text, and organized meetings in local centers
to discuss it; most members, it seems, were not familiar with the text and
read it in translation. Another major omission from their recitations,
which will play a greater role in my discussion of the Poetry Bookshop,
was contemporary poetry. A few nods were made to anachronisms like William
Watson and Stephen Phillips, but generally the local centers showed little
interest in contemporary verse, and none in anything experimental.

<P>
The exclusionary principles of price and taste had the consequence of a
distinctly middle- and upper-middle-class makeup to the Poetry Society's
chapters. The organization had a central headquarters, but its activities
took place primarily at local chapters in London and other cities across
Great Britain and even Australia. The London branches were almost all in
the western and northwestern parts of the city--


<B></B>


the middle- and
upper-middle-class neighborhoods and suburbs. Continuing the tradition of
Victorian salon readings, the meetings were usually held in the homes of
local members, and were not in any meaningful way "public."

<P>
Anticipating the recommendations of the Newbolt Report, the Poetry Society
directed their efforts at an important means of cultural reproduction--the
education system. The Society intended to stimulate an interest in poetry,
and it deemed the training of the voice with recently updated elocution
techniques essential to this task. The Society positioned itself as a
legitimating body, professionalized in granting cultural credentials. It
drew upon the prestige of the newly professionalized field of elocution
and speech training, and noted on its monthly list of officers a Dr. H. H.
Hulbert, "Hon. Technical Adviser (Elocution) and Professional
Examiner."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Hulbert not only trained Society members to
develop the pure voice; he also examined and certified them. The
<I>Gazette </I>announced the examinations and regularly kept readers
abreast of them:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
a comprehensive and authoritative examination scheme has been drawn up.
Recognition is being obtained for this test, which will give it a high
professional value. Primarily it is intended to apply to teachers who wish
to work in association with the Society or to have the Society's definite
recognition and endorsement of their qualifications, but private members
will derive great benefit from it, and are urged to enter for each
section.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The test consisted of a "cultural" section with "testing of general
knowledge and appreciation of poetry"; a section on "Theory and practice
of teaching" conducted by Dr. Hulbert; and a "practical speaking test"
administered by the president of the Poetry Society during which the
examinee had to read aloud, answer some questions, and recite Matthew
Arnold's "Shakespeare."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Although the examination was open to
members of the society, nonmember professional candidates had to pay one
guinea for the exam, and up to five guineas for subsequent exams.
Nonprofessional nonmembers paid two shillings and six pence per section,
and professional reciters who weren't teachers paid fifteen shillings.
Again, cost would have discouraged anyone below the solidly middle class.

<P>
But beyond positioning the society as the arbiter of cultural competence
and oral prowess, these examinations were part of a larger move to
influence the educational system in London. In a time of school expansion
and reform, the Poetry Society saw the importance of primary- and
secondary-school literary- and speech-training programs to the
reproduction of urban middle-class culture. It kept abreast of
professional activities in the field of speech education, and considered
schemes "for developing its work among schools and colleges."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>

The Poetry Society thus founded a "Junior Order" designed to "introduc[e]
the work of the Society into public and private secondary schools." These
organizations held regular meetings to read and discuss the poetry
sanctioned by the society. The society stipulated that "At least one
teacher in each school adopting this Junior Order must be an ordinary
member of the Society, he or she (or another member of the staff who is
also a member of the


<B></B>


Society) to be president of the school
branch."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 These Junior Orders were established in London and
in other cities, and were regularly reported on in the <I>Gazette.
</I>Moreover, the Poetry Society enjoyed a close relationship with
activities in the London elementary schools, for example, arranging
recitations. The Junior Orders also received recognition by professional
magazines like <I>The School World. </I>School inspectors had noted in
turn-of-the-century Board of Education reports that many Board School
teachers themselves scarcely knew their English literature and, moreover,
spoke with "impure" dialects.

<P>
Again anticipating the concerns of the Newbolt Report, the Poetry Society
responded to class anxieties by organizing contests for judging the purity
of schoolchildren's speech. One contemporary news article noted that

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Not only Dr. Hulbert, but various other authorities on speech, have
noticed that everybody in the metropolis is becoming Cockney in speech, a
tendency that can best be overcome by little local gatherings for the
study and contemplation of the best poetry and the general practice of the
art of speaking verse. And what is better still, it can be done
quickly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The contest included high-school and college contestants, but also for the
first time "a contingent from the London County Council children, and the
examination consisted mainly in speaking verse they had studied and in
reading at sight unknown pieces. . . . They were not picked children, and
their own readings gave no trace of the Cockney accent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

Clearly the accents of the dominant classes had become normalized as the
language of culture.

<P>
The attempts by the Poetry Society to influence pedagogy and the public's
literary taste can be seen as part of the reforming spirit of the
Edwardian age. But the educational reforms and the Poetry Society's
attempts to influence them clearly served a class agenda, and spoke to
anxieties that the reforms themselves may have helped to produce. As
Bourdieu notes, the educational system helps to "form a general,
transposable disposition towards legitimate culture" (<I>D,</I> 23), and
"channels pupils towards prestigious or devalued positions implying or
excluding legitimate practice" (<I>D,</I> 25). Education helps to
legitimate markers of distinction even to those who cannot share in them:
"The official differences produced by academic classifications tend to
produce (or reinforce) real differences by including in the classified
individuals a collectively recognized and supported belief in the
differences, thus producing behaviors that are intended to bring real
being into line with official being" (<I>D,</I> 25). The pure voice that
the school system and the Poetry Society encouraged served to legitimate
middle-class accents even to lower-class pupils, and the literary taste
consecrated by the Poetry Society and their school programs served the
same function. Working-class children could not lose strong Cockney
accents during a few weeks of preparation for a contest; the
institutionalization of the pure voice in poetry recitation meant that
children whose families had instilled middle-class accents and literary
tastes in them were the most likely to receive official affirmation



<B></B>


of their tastes and accents. Furthermore, the working-class
children's belief in their own inferiority would be reinforced. Not
surprisingly, the higher up one was in the class system, the more one was
likely to succeed in the school system ("S," 161).

<B>Modernism, Verse Recitation, and Public Performance</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The Poetry Society and the larger educational and elocutionary communities
rallied around the pure voice and the oral performance of poetry, whether
as well-intentioned reform, class paranoia, or simply a performative
display of legitimacy. However, though educational reforms and the
verse-recitation movement may seem unlikely contexts for emerging
modernist poetry, these discourses opened an opportunity for modernist
poets. Harold Monro--and the modernist and Georgian poets associated with
his magazines and the successful <I>Georgian Poetry
</I>anthologies--attempted to tap into the popular practice of verse
recitation and the performance of the pure voice to bring modernist poetry
before the public.

<P>
Monro and many of his readers envisioned even purely literary little
magazines like <I>The Poetry Review </I>and <I>Poetry and Drama </I>not as
elitist coterie organs, but as exactly the opposite: as organs for the
popularization of poetry. Monro shared with other early modernist writers
an optimism about reaching new audiences within the urban masses. His
first leader in <I>The Poetry Review </I>asserted, "Poetry is said to be
unpopular--generally by those who dislike it themselves. Good poetry is as
much read now as at any time since the invention of printing, and bad
poetry is certainly read a great deal too much."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 And
elsewhere he proclaimed, "A majority of intelligent people still argues
that poetry is unpopular: it is one of the objects of POETRY AND DRAMA to
dispel this illusion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 His readers also assumed that the
magazine was not to be a coterie affair.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Monro wanted not to
inspire mass-market verse, but to popularize Georgian and modernist
challenges to Victorian orthodoxies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 As a step toward this
goal, he accepted the editorship of <I>The Poetry Review </I>(also
circulated by the Poetry Recital Society), which would be published with
the society's regular monthly <I>The Poetical Gazette.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

<P>
What ensued from this odd pairing of experimental modernist poets and the
proponents of Tennyson and William Watson was a battle over the power to
consecrate poetry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 The taste for the long-accepted Victorian
greats that helped provide legitimacy to Edwardian middle-class culture
was challenged by a more restricted field of cultural production--the
network of young poets and dramatists, avant-garde theaters, and little
magazines and small presses. This network attempted to legitimate, even in
the eyes (or ears) of middle-class audiences, contemporary poetry, which
was largely ignored by the verse-recitation industry and the educational
system. Needless to say, much energy was devoted in the early issues of
<I>The Poetry Review </I>to defining critical practices and their roles in
elucidating the new verse experiments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 But the
verse-recitation movement and the Poetry Society had given Monro and other
modernist poets the opportunity to t this battle not only within the



<B></B>


magazines but, above all, in the public oral performances, lectures,
and discussions that were the inspiration for the Poetry Bookshop.

<P>
In Monro's magazines and at the Poetry Bookshop, much of the discussion
about new poetry and verse drama was positioned in the larger field of
cultural discourse I have charted that privileged the oral over the
visual, the pure voice over the "artificiality" of music-hall spectacle
and poetry written "for the page." <I>The Poetry Review </I>was strewn
with ads for elocutionists seeking pupils; it advertised and reviewed
recitation anthologies, and even planned a special issue on verse
recitation. The widespread affirmations by the verse-recitationists of
oral performance as a facilitator of literary appreciation, and their
paired emphases on impersonality and authorial presence were mainstays of
the discussion of the "poetry renaissance" and of modernists' prewar
aesthetic assumptions. Adopting the prevalent class-based discourses of
the day, Monro noted of a recent poetry recital: "Miss Irwin's attempt to
excite the senses of the audience was hopeless from the start . . . all
her ringing of gongs and tricks with hideous limelight fell flat--as they
should. . . . Poetry is not, and never will be, a music-hall
art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P>
Monro found that these bourgeois principles could accommodate avant-garde
poetic practices as well. His excitement about F. T. Marinetti largely
derived from the Futurist's abilities not only as a modern verse
innovator, but also as a public reader. Excitedly writing about
Marinetti's "wonderful reading," Monro explained that "[Futurist] poetry
is composed recklessly for immediate and wide circulation and declamation
in large assemblies, frequently for purposes of propaganda. It is verse
rather for the ear than for any close and studious scrutiny by the
eye."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 In his "Wireless Imagination and Words at Liberty"
manifesto published in the same issue of <I>Poetry and Drama</I>,
Marinetti himself noted proudly that "the number of futurist reciters is
steadily increasing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 But the English privileging of the ear
over the eye was established long before the Futurist invasion, and helped
to shape its reception.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P>
Even foreign works chosen for publication in <I>Poetry and Drama
</I>affirm this indigenous oral emphasis. F. S. Flint, who regularly
penned the "French Chronicle" for the magazine, translated a speech by
Henri Gh&eacute;on in which he praised the new practice of verse
recitation preceding a play. Gh&eacute;on attacked those who felt that
poetry should be left to the pages of a book:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
there is not one of the words composing [a poem] that does not vibrate
physically in our mind. . . . it may be said that they recite to us
within. . . . Who knows but that the poem, by its enforced seclusion, runs
the risk of losing, little by little, that authentic life which it owes to
human speech, and which it will always find therein so long as speech is
not divorced from poetry. We read too much with our eyes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
He explores a crucial element of the modernist appropriation of
<I>avant-guerre </I>recitation tenets: "these readings will provide a
useful test of the new poetry, which, by its many innovations in sonority
and rhythm, demands of the reader a personal effort that, either on
account of indolence or habit, he is not always willing to make. He



<B></B>


must be made to hear this music that as yet he does not hear
alone."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Gh&eacute;on suggests that public readings aid the
appreciation of formal experiment, an idea that Monro and his compatriots
would underscore.

<P>
Monro and the contributors to his magazines appropriated contemporary
discourse about verse recitation in order to put it to use for the
popularization of new experimental poetry. Monro asserted that "It is
abundantly proved that good poetry, well read, will interest the practical
average man as well as the practical average woman," and that the lack of
ability to recite verse skillfully was "responsible for the so-called
'unpopularity' of poetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 In the effort to create a
sympathetic audience for the new verse, Monro founded the Poetry Bookshop.
The Poetry Bookshop opened in January 1913 in an eighteenth-century house
in Bloomsbury near the British Museum. It featured both new and old poetry
for sale (the former a rarity in London), rooms to lodge visiting young
poets, and a room for verse readings.

<P>
As a space for oral performance, the Poetry Bookshop was literally central
to Monro's hopes for a poetic revolution. He noted,

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We make a regular practice of reading poetry aloud, and any one who wishes
to stroll in and listen may do so. . . . We are absolutely certain that
the proper values of poetry can only be conveyed through its vocal
interpretation by a sympathetic and qualified reader. Indeed so obvious
does this appear that we regard the books on sale in the shop merely as
printed scores for the convenience of refreshing the memory in hours of
study or indolence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>

<P>
Monro proposed the Poetry Bookshop as an antidote to an increasingly
visual society:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Every year humanity continues to use its ears less and to trust more to
its eyes. At present there can be scarcely a hundred first-class readers
of poetry in England, the demand for them having almost ceased. But we are
on the way to altering this. We hope that Poetry Bookshops will eventually
be established in all the principal towns of England.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

Monro explained that a customer could "hear the poetry he wishes to buy
read aloud by someone who loves and understands it. Or he can come to our
Poetry Recitals which will be held twice a week, to which all interested
will be welcome."

A dichotomy later familiar to readers of the Vorticist diatribes in the
periodical <I>Blast </I>emerged with <I>The Poetry Review'</I>s rhetorical
privileging of the voice over the eye.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 In 1912, Ezra Pound
had criticized some of the poems in Ford Madox Ford's <I>High Germany:</I>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[Ford's] flaw is the flaw of impressionism, impressionism, that is,
carried out of its due medium. Impressionism belongs in paint, it is of
the eye. The cinematograph records, for instance, the "impression" of any
given action or place, far more exactly than the finest writing, it
transmits the impression to its "audiences" with less work on their part.
A ball of gold and a gilded ball give the same "impression" to the
painter. Poetry is in some odd way concerned with the specific gravity of
things, with their nature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>
<B></B>

<P>
Though Pound and Wyndham Lewis would blast impressionism far more
forcefully a few years later, Pound's point is not just that Ford
mistakenly tries to appropriate a practice that belongs properly in the
visual realm, but also that impressionism, like the mass-cultural
cinematograph, merely records surface detail, which can be deceptive.
Poetry, remaining in the verbal realm, grasps essences, not just faithful
visual reproductions of surfaces.

<P>
Many articles in Monro's magazines made much the same case in calling for
a popular verse drama. Several Georgian poets were involved in writing
verse plays, as Yeats had been for years, and the argument was frequently
made that the realist aesthetics of the current theater merely reproduced
the superficial, whereas verse drama achieved a more profound sense of
character and ideal. Lascelles Abercrombie argued that "the great
difference between prose drama and poetry drama is that the first
concentrates its imitation on the outermost reality, the second on the
innermost," and that characters in verse drama had "a greater precision
and definiteness of design," which resulted from the "exaggeration in the
<I>shape </I>of the speech they utter."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Emphasizing voice
over spectacle, other <I>Poetry Review </I>authors made similar arguments
for a "purer" theater, based on the "alive" speech of verse
drama.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>

<P>
Yeats, who read at the Poetry Bookshop, and whose oral performances and
verse dramas were frequently discussed in the magazine, had developed an
interest in verse drama in the 1890s as a means of reaching a wider
public. His emphasis was strongly on "alive speech," rather than on
spectacle. To convey the rhythms of his poetic line, he had even asked a
company working up one of his plays "to let [him] rehearse them in barrels
that they might forget gesture and have their minds free to think of
speech for a while."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Again, this privileging of the oral
performance over the visual staging in experimental theater (whether by
Georgians or by modernists like Yeats and, later, Eliot) was supported by
larger cultural institutions. While the Poetry Society and its offspring,
the Verse Drama Society, tried to revive interest in verse drama,
educators began to explore the uses of verse drama and choral speaking in
the classroom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>

<P>
This movement toward verse drama found its modernist incarnation in the
early criticism of a newcomer on the London scene, T. S. Eliot. In <I>The
Sacred Wood, </I>Eliot frequently imagines resurrecting the verse drama in
England, claiming that "The essential [thing] is to get upon the stage
this precise statement of life which is at the same time a point of view,
a world--a world which the author's mind has subjected to a complete
process of simplification."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Eliot, like Yeats, saw a great
opportunity to reach a broader audience for poetry through the verse
drama. He claimed that "a large number of poets hanker for the stage; and
. . . a not negligible public appears to want verse plays" (<I>SW,</I>
60). "The Elizabethan drama was aimed at a public which wanted
<I>entertainment </I>of a crude sort, but would <I>stand </I>a good deal
of poetry; our problem should be to take a form of entertainment, and
subject it to the process which would leave it a form of art" (<I>SW,</I>
70). Eliot, himself a fan of the music hall,


<B></B>


even cautiously raised
the possibility that music-hall comedy might be the most appropriate form.
He chose, however, to create verse drama, rather than working-class
music-hall pieces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Given that the context of discussion of
verse drama and poetic performance was implicated in a normative
middle-class movement emphasizing "purity" of diction and pronunciation,
his decision, and the modernist movement toward verse drama, had a class
valence that was inescapable.

<P>
In addition to turning bourgeois discourse about verse recitation and
literary appreciation to the advantage of modern poetry, Monro and fellow
writers also picked up the call for the impersonality of the verse reciter
that had been a mainstay of the attack on earlier elocution styles by the
verse-recitation movement. Monro wrote of a reading by one Alexander
Watson:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Certainly his enunciation is clear, his elocution excellent, and his voice
splendidly controlled; yet it was not "The Everlasting Mercy" he gave us,
but rather a demonstration of his own powers, using "The Everlasting
Mercy" as a medium. In the same way, Miss Nora Clarke at the Steinway Hall
made herself throughout the sole element of importance in her recital.
While fully realizing the difficulties of self-repression, particularly in
the situation of sole occupant of a public platform, we cannot but think
that the whole training of the actor or reciter is adapted to impede
rather than to promote the enjoyable reading or recitation of good
poetry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As in contemporaneous recitation manuals, bad reciters--often equated with
actors and elocutionists--are faulted for imposing their personalities
onto poems, and for not having the faculty of "self-repression," the sort
of impersonality that allows the presence of the author to speak through
the reciter and thus to convey the proper meaning of the poem.

<P>
For an example of the ideal reciter, Monro turns to Florence Farr, who had
helped Yeats produce verse dramas in London and accompanied his lectures
on verse-speaking with recitations of his poems. Her book, <I>The Music of
Speech </I>, championed Yeats's methods of verse
reading.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 Monro praises her "clarity" and the "melodiousness
of her voice," but what earns her the status of "artist," and not just
elocutionist, is precisely her ability to surrender to the poem, and to
convey its formal qualities in live performance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 He hoped
other reciters would "have sufficient restraint and self-surrender to
submit themselves, after her manner, to the cadence and rhythms of poetry,
becoming, for the time being, a sensitive medium for their conveyance to
the audience, rhapsodist rather than exponent, instrument rather than
representative."
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Vincent Sherry holds up Farr's book as the
epitome of the kind of oral, empathetic aesthetic that he aligns with
Henri Bergson, and that he suggests Pound, Lewis, and T. E. Hulme rejected
in their move toward French ocular paradigms. I don't dispute Sherry's
analysis, especially since his work largely deals with the postwar period,
but I would suggest that Bergson seems not to have played much of a role
in the discussions of oral performance in prewar London, either in the
mainstream versions or in Harold Monro's magazines--rather, these notions
had been around in the recitation debates for a couple of decades. Above
all, I would argue


<B></B>


that as modernist poets looked for audiences in
prewar London, they often found themselves on this oral side of Sherry's
competing paradigms.

<P>
During this same period, discussions about the impersonal performance of
the pure voice worked their way into modernist literary circles via
Monro's magazines and the Poetry Bookshop, and, by the end of the war,
they had been picked up by Eliot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Much of Eliot's first
collection of criticism, <I>The Sacred Wood, </I>reads like a synthesis of
the interests and ideals of the verse-recitation movement. He shared the
concern about the personality of the performer overriding the emotion of
the poetry: "The interest of a performer is almost certain to be centered
in himself. . . . The performer is interested not in form but in
opportunities for virtuosity or in the communication of his 'personality'"
(<I>SW</I>, 69). He also addressed the murky imprecision about whether the
proper reciter surrendered his/her personality to the poem or to the poet;
in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," he explained that aesthetically
<I>"significant </I>emotion" is "emotion which has its life in the poem
and not in the history of the poet. The emotion of art is impersonal. And
the poet cannot reach this impersonality without surrendering himself
wholly to the work to be done" (<I>SW,</I> 59; emphasis Eliot's). Authors
of verse-recitation and elocution manuals, as well as the president of the
Poetry Society, had emphasized the distinction conferred upon the
impersonal reader who surrendered to the poem read; Eliot transformed this
for modernist poetics by adding that the poet also must abdicate his or
her own personality and emotions to those of the poem.

<P>
These interrelated notions of presence and impersonality also influenced
the critical practice that emerged in later issues of <I>Poetry and Drama.
</I>In laying out changes that would occur in the second volume of the
magazine, Monro tried to reshape its critical practices around a notion of
impersonality:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In spite of the admirable work of our staff of critics in the past, we
have for some time doubted the efficacy of the orthodox methods of
criticism in their application to current poetry, and it was only our
failure to discover or invent some more compatible method which obliged us
to continue along the orthodox lines. We have decided, however, with
certain exceptions, to represent the volumes which come before us in 1914
solely by quotation, without comment. Thus the twenty or thirty pages at
present usually devoted to reviews will be occupied instead by extracts
from current volumes.

by this combination between a Chronicle and a series of extracts, we hope

As in much modernist poetry, the reader was asked to take a more active
role, to confront the poetry directly rather than through any mediation

<B></B>


process used to assemble the extracts.
Juxtaposition of admired work with "ridiculous productions of bad poets"
was to allow the reader to come to an understanding of modernist poetry
beyond that which a discursive text might convey ("NA," 392). Readers
seemed to approve of this practice and equated it with an esteemed
impersonality; Dixon Scott wrote to Monro after the first issue that
adopted the practice, "I admired your chronicle tremendously. It is most
excellently designed--the massing of the quotations works splendidly; and
your judgments have a beautiful sanity, strictness, and dignity. I envy
you your power of impersonality: if I were you I'd make the impersonal my
mark: <I>you've</I> no need to ask your I's to assert your
individuality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 Monro's critical practice of "massing . . .
quotations" was an extension of verse-performance commonplaces, but it
will also look somewhat familiar to readers of <I>The Waste Land, </I>or
Pound's <I>Cantos. </I>The <I>Cantos </I>are impersonal in that there is
no consistent single lyric voice at the center of each poem, but they
nonetheless rely upon the "presence" of past voices in the form of
letters, remembered conversations, engravings in stone pillars, and so
forth, all organized by principles of juxtaposition. The aesthetics of
presence--created by importing directly both poetic and nonliterary
writing (like the letters in Malatesta's mailbag)--became a far more
sophisticated poetic practice than Monro might have envisioned, but
achieves its poetic power in much the same way as he had exercised the
method.

<P>
Modernist and Georgian poets associated with the Poetry Bookshop turned
the discourse of the pure voice and authorial presence into a call for the
poets themselves to read their work publicly. As much as Monro and others
praised the good reciter, Monro also had some quiet doubts about the
sufficiency of verse reciters to his aims of popularizing modern poetry.
In notes for a lecture on modern poetry, he wrote, "Today we have schools
of speech training and also verse speaking competitions all over the
country, and I wonder whether those who"; he then crossed this out and
rephrased the thought: "Today the speaking of poetry has been divorced
from the creation of poetry, just as the singing of song has been from the
composition of song."
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 Monro saw the presence of the poet
himself or herself as necessary to the public reception of modernist
poetry.

<P>
The readings at the Poetry Bookshop represent a fundamental historical
shift in the relationship of English poets to their public. Major
Victorian poets like Tennyson, Browning, and Arnold enjoyed great public
prestige (witness the late-Victorian Browning Societies and the godlike
public reputation of Tennyson), but it was not part of the understanding
of the role of the poet in Victorian society to read
publicly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 While the public verse reading by a poet was more
common in America, by the mid-twentieth century this cultural norm
had dramatically reversed, with poetry reading nearly as popular in
England as in America, and the Poetry Bookshop was a major reason why.

<P>
The public space for the discussion and reception of poetry that Monro
wished to create involved poets reading their works twice a week at the
bookshop. These readings, or "poetry squashes," as many called them, cost
only three pence--and each issue of <I>Poetry and Drama </I>contained a
free ticket to a reading (<I>GR,</I> 76). They were


<B></B>


much more in line
with the widely public goals of the Victorian Penny Readings movement than
the largely private and expensive Poetry Society readings. Monro worked
hard to convince poets of the importance of reading, twisting the arms of
reluctant public readers like Rupert Brooke, who did the first reading in
January 1913 (GR, 75), and he corresponded prodigiously with poets to
arrange readings.

<P>
In addition to fostering audience appreciation of new poetry, these public
readings underscored the centrality of the spoken word to modernist
aesthetics. Francis Macnamara, who had just read his poems at the
Bookshop, wrote that

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
if [poets] will only give every word its natural stress, the rhythm would
declare itself. This should be so, of course, in all poetry: it is the
only way to mend the trouble of actors turning verse into prose. . . . I
am sure that you are doing more for poetry by getting people to read aloud
their own things than has been done in England for many a day.. . . it is
the only way for poets to learn.

In spite of his ridicule of what he saw as the audience's sympathies for
Georgian poets, Pound noted the value of these readings at the Bookshop to
his ascetic, modernist impulse:

For Pound--who by this time had already penned his first cantos--giving
voice to his own poems helped him revise them into leaner, more focused
works.

<P>
In <I>Theory of the Avant-Garde, </I>Peter B&uuml;rger traces a history of
bourgeois art similar to that illustrated in the pages of <I>The Poetry
Review </I>and <I>Poetry and Drama. </I>He describes the development of
the bourgeois category of art as one of increasing aesthetic autonomy, a
distancing from life praxis evident even in the solitary absorption in the
work of art that characterized aesthetic reception.
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 Monro and
other early British modernists envisioned this historical transformation
of the institution of art during the print age as one of poetry abandoning
the communal realm of oral performance and social significance, and
entering the private, stale realm of the bourgeois study.
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>

Though this critique anticipates the attacks on aesthetic autonomy by
groups that B&uuml;rger considers avant-garde--Dada, Futurism, Surrealism,
and the Russian avant-garde--his understanding of the avant-garde as
reintegrating art and praxis would not describe an activity that took
place entirely within a discrete aesthetic realm. B&uuml;rger himself,
admitting the failure of the historic avant-garde, wonders "whether the
distance between art and the praxis of life is not requisite for that free
space within which alternatives to what exists become
conceivable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 This latter was closer to Monro's and his
compatriots' understanding of the social potential for art. I



<B></B>


suggest that the appropriation of the cultural practice of verse
recitation, and its transformation of an indirect emphasis on authorial
presence into a direct call for authors to read their own works in public
was in fact an attempt both to reach new audiences and foster literary
appreciation of modernist poetry, and to reintegrate art and life. The
resuscitation in <I>The Poetry Review </I>and <I>Poetry and Drama </I>of
prebourgeois terms of oral community--village readings, balladeers as
newspapers, <I>improvisatori, </I>Homeric public declamations, the Poetry
Bookshop as a "guild," and so forth--were part of an attempt to envision a
reinvigorated oral culture that would escape the privatized aesthetic
reception of bourgeois culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 While such projects were
utopian, Monro's magazines and his Poetry Bookshop were able to
appropriate the logic of the pure voice as a marker of distinction in
order to change the field of production and reception of literary culture,
and thus helped effect a transformation of the relationship of poet to
public.

<P>
The class anxieties that brought the voice and the oral performance of
poetry as well as verse drama into vogue also helped form and justify the
orientation toward speech within the modernist poetry of Britain. The
popularity of verse drama in the 1940s and 1950s centered around Eliot's
success at bringing it before West End, middle-class audiences; after
World War I, prominent speech-education pioneers like Elsie Fogerty and
Marjorie Gullan helped to institutionalize in the British school
curriculum tenets of verse speaking that they validated by talking to
poets like Monro. Though these practices involved reciters who were not
themselves poets, they helped prepare a generation to enjoy public poetry
readings. After World War II, and following successes like Dylan Thomas,
the 1960s and 1970s witnessed a poetry-performance movement in Britain
that built upon the possibilities opened up by the Poetry Bookshop. The
widespread readings of the period, and such centers of the poetry
performance movement as Morden Tower in Newcastle owed much to Harold
Monro's vision.
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 As Basil Bunting, a link between the
modernists and this new generation, and the mentor of the young Newcastle
poets, told them, "Poetry lies dead on the page, until some voice brings
it to life."

In "The Elocutionary Movement in England, 1750-1850" (Ph.D.diss.,

elocution to the mid-eighteenth-century interest in improving the delivery
of public speakers--primarily upper-class schoolboys, the clergy, future
M. P.'s, barristers, and members of the wealthier middle classes
(1-35, 388-89). While many eighteenth-century elocution manuals
were written by actors, in the nineteenth century, the clergy and voice
development "experts" tended to be the authors.

convey his meaning" (<I>SH,</I> 8).

however, had to defray its expenses and give any profits beyond his outlay
plus interest to the Poetry Society; he was, in addition, subject to the
scrutiny of the society's council. As he put it, "I practically sold
myself to the Society." In return, however, he received an assured
circulation of one thousand copies a month (though he only received a
total of five pounds for it). Monro bailed out after a year of the unhappy
arrangement (<I>HM,</I> 39).

I borrow the term "consecration" and the notion of the field ofcultural
production from Pierre Bourdieu's <I>The Field of Cultural
Production,</I> ed. Randal Johnson (New York: Columbia University Press,
1994). Bourdieu analyzes the way culture reproduces social structures; he
posits a field of cultural production that has a logic of its own, beyond
economic determinants. Bourdieu notes the role played not only by authors,
but also by critics, art dealers, publishers, theater managers, and so
forth in producing belief in the cultural legitimacy and value of works of
art, that is, in consecrating them .

While Monro affirmed the oral-performative dimension of Futurism, hebroke
ranks with the Futurist's call for innovative typography. In an

sufficient entity in itself, and our normal course would have been to
produce it without typographical or interpretative decoration" (Harold

Our America and Nativist Modernism:<BR>

<hr>
<!--_text-->

<P>
The thesis of Walter Benn Michaels's <I>Our America</I> could hardly be
clearer or more forcefully argued. It goes like
this. Whereas "the major writers of the Progressive period--London,
Dreiser, Wharton--were comparatively indifferent to
questions of both racial and national identity" (<I>OA,</I> 8), the
literature of the postwar, of the 1920s, is
characterized by its particular brand of <I>nativism,</I> that is, its
commitment to the notion that one's identity is
defined by racial difference. Whereas the Progressivists believed in the
fabled melting pot, in the possibility of
wholesale assimilation into U. S. citizenry, the pluralist 1920s,
substituting a faith in difference for one in the
superiority of any one group, wanted to preserve racial purity at all
costs. Accordingly, identity comes to be defined
by one's difference from "them"--from those whose blood might contaminate
one's own. The fear of miscegenation and of
the reproductive family now become powerful; "the homosexual family and
the incestuous family thus emerge as parallel
technologies in the effort to prevent half-breeds" (<I>OA,</I> 49).

<P>
Michaels exemplifies this thesis with literally dozens of examples,
primarily from the fiction of the period. In
William
Faulkner's <I>The Sound and the Fury,</I> Quentin Compson's desire to
convince others that he has committed incest with
his sister Caddy is an "attempt through language to substitute the blood
ties of family for the affective and/or legal
ties of love and marriage." (<I>OA,</I> 5) In this respect, Quentin and
Jason are really not all that different; both
believe, in their own way, that "blood is blood" (<I>OA,</I> 3). Or again,
in F. Scott Fitzgerald's <I>The Great
Gatsby,</I> Tom Buchanan's aversion to Gatsby has less to do with



<B></B>


class than with race. For who is Gatsby? Is he
perhaps a Jew, hanging out as he does with the likes of Meyer Wolfsheim?
In any case, he is not "one of us," any more
than is Robert Cohn in <I>The Sun Also Rises.</I> But then that novel's
hero, Jake Barnes, functions as Cohn's alter
ego: Jake's war wound, which has left him impotent, Michaels argues, is
again an emblem of the nativist fear of the
reproductive family. In staying single, Jake preserves his racial
identity.

<P>
And so on. From Willa Cather's <I>The Professor's House</I> to Nella
Larsen's <I>Passing</I> and <I>Quicksand,</I> from
Jean Toomer's <I>Cane</I> to Carl Van Vechten's <I>Nigger Heaven,</I>
nativism is the engine that drives human
behavior,
and in the 1920s, nativism depends first and last on understanding one's
Americanness as racial difference. In Oliver
La
Farge's <I>Laughing Boy,</I> for example, Slim Girl's "genealogical
ambition is to have children who are 'all Navajo'"
(<I>OA,</I> 71), even as Nella Larsen's Clare learns that "passing"
destroys the purity of her own identity. One must
be
true to one's racial self.

<P>
Pluralism thus turns out to be the bogey. Whereas Progressivist "claims to
racial superiority inevitably involved the
appeal to standards that were understood as common to all races. . . . the
pluralist can prefer his own race only on
the
grounds that it is his" (<I>OA,</I> 137). The commitment to pluralism is
the commitment to the "primacy of identity"
(<I>OA,</I> 140), and thus to what Michaels calls "identity essentialism"
(<I>OA,</I> 140). Indeed, "there can be no
coherent anti-essentialist account of race" (<I>OA,</I> 134). For "the
particular contribution of pluralism to racism
is
to make racial identity into its own justification" (<I>OA,</I> 137). And
when that happens--as is, according to
Michaels, the cultural condition today--racism prevails.

<P>
But why did this form of nativism occur in the 1920s and recur in the
1990s? What about the six decades in between? And
why should miscegenation be such a taboo if the racial Other is considered
not inferior but merely different, as
Michaels claims? These issues are avoided by a curious sleight-of-hand.
The inevitable reductionism of Michaels's
project (the discussion of <I>Gatsby,</I> for example, must play down the
role of Nick Carraway so as to foreground Tom
Buchanan's fears) is acknowledged and declared necessary, given the
revisionist aim of <I>Our America,</I> which is to
provide, not close readings of specific texts, but a large-scale
reinterpretation of modernism. For American nativism
is
evidently synonymous with American modernism, which is, in its turn,
synonymous with the American fiction (few works of
other genres are included) of the 1920s.

<P>
For most literary historians, as for theorists of modernism, the great
modernist innovations were in place well before
World War I. In his recent <I>Modernisms,</I> for example, Peter Nicholls
characteristically begins with Charles
Baudelaire even as T. J. Clark's earlier <I>The Painting of Modern
Life</I> began with Edouard Manet. But then
Michaels's "modernism" is best described as a modernism without the
modernists, for the most canonical American
modernist writers--Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, H. D., Gertrude Stein, Djuna
Barnes--are eliminated from Michaels's
American
modernist canon, presumably because they lived abroad and took an interest
in non-American persons and places. For
example:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the endpoint of the "heritage" whose origin Pound locates in Jefferson is
. . . Benito Mussolini: "The heritage of
Jefferson . . . is HERE, NOW <I>in the Italian peninsula </I>at the
beginning of the fascist second decennio, not in
Massachusetts or Delaware." This "heritage" is thus in no way
distinctively American, any more than it is distinctly
Italian. Rather, it is disassociated from any particular nationality and,
indeed, from nationality as such, a concept
which Pound tended to link disparagingly with "provincialism." And, by the
same token, the "ancestors" to whom Eliot
appeals in "Tradition and the Individual Talent"  not only extend
beyond . . . his American predecessors to "the
whole of the literature of Europe" but beyond Europe as well to "all the
poetry that has ever been written." Neither
Eliot's "tradition" nor Pound's "heritage" is in any sense <I>national.
</I>. . . [<I>OA,</I> 102]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
What this line of reasoning ignores is that the very idea of linking
Jefferson to Mussolini is itself a profoundly
nativist theme. It assumes that the desire to transcend one's native
grounds, to assert one's difference from "ordinary
Americans," again, by the way, on the grounds of racial purity of some
sort (e. g., true Americans know that their
heritage can never just be American!), is a desire that can somehow be
satisfied, even as Quentin thinks that
<I>saying</I> he has had incest with Caddy means that it really happened.
Similarly, Eliot's desire in "Tradition and
the Individual Talent" to place his own poetry in relation to "all the
poetry that has ever been written" (<I>OA,</I>
102) could only have been made by a poet self-consciously American, and
hence self-consciously inserting himself into
the European arena where poetry does flourish. Just try to imagine Marcel
Proust or
St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; or Paul Val&eacute;ry claiming that theirs
was a heritage that transcended their
national identity!

<P>
Ironically, a consideration of Pound's or Eliot's nativism would have
"thickened the plot" of Michaels's narrative.
Think of Eliot's "East Coker," with its claim for a racial identity (pure
English stock) that distinguishes the poet
from those others who have names like Sweeney or Bleistein. But even if we
grant Michaels his donn&eacute;e, even if we
assume that such internationalists as Eliot and Pound, Stein and Barnes
are outside the "nativist" orbit, how can we
equate nativism with modernism, when Michaels also eliminates such notable
stay-at-homes as Wallace Stevens, whose name
does not so much as appear in Michaels's index, even though Stevens's
first great book, <I>Harmonium,</I> appeared in
1923? The answer is not hard to find. Clearly, if one substitutes for
Eliot and Stevens such texts as Anzia Yezierska's
<I>Bread Givers</I> or La Farge's <I>Laughing Boy,</I> novels currently
being read precisely on account of their
multicultural rather than their literary interest, then of course one can
come up with a reinterpretation of
"modernism"
as racially motivated. The reasoning is patently circular:  modernism
has traditionally been defined as <I>X.</I>

Minority studies of the modernist period have unearthed a number of novels
that are more properly characterized as
<I>Y.</I> Therefore  modernism should be redefined as <I>Y.</I>

<P>
Thus nativism = modernism: such equations occur in <I>Our America</I>
because its analytic mode is structuralist rather
than in any sense historical. The identitarian paradigm once introduced
recurs with minor variations in novel after
novel: Michaels's synopses and exegeses become as repetitive and
interchangeable as do the characters in <I>The
Professor's House</I> and <I>The Sun Also Rises.</I> There is a "Gotcha!"
quality to all


<B></B>


this, as if to say, "Oh,
so <I>you</I> thought <I>Gatsby</I> dealt with the power of human illusion
or with the failure of the American dream
and
so on, but what the novel is <I>really</I> about is race." The static
nature of the analyses is ensured by the curious
absence of <I>history.</I> Why was the postwar so different from the
Progressivist era? What is it that happened that
made pluralism and its attendant racism so prominent? To explore the
changing demographics or immigration patterns of
the 1920s, to understand the effect of a world war on the modernist ethos,
would have gone a long way in explaining why
Robert Cohn res so prominently in <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> or why Tom
Buchanan is reading a book called <I>The
Rise
of the Colored Empires.</I> An historical study, especially of the war
period, would also demonstrate in what ways
"identity essentialism" became important in nations other than the U. S.
In Thomas Mann's <I>Buddenbrooks</I> ,
for example, national identity is still an attribute one has as a German
citizen plain and simple, and the emphasis is
on social and economic class. But for the Mann of <I>The Magic
Mountain</I> , racialized identity has become a
central concern. The shifting of national boundaries after the war, the
influx of Eastern European Jews into Germany
and
the West, the questions of the Sudetenland and Alsace-Lorraine: all these
produced a strong emphasis on the need for
racial purity.

<P>
Just as literary texts seem to have no historical determinants, so they
have, in Michaels's spatialized, structuralist
paradigm, no authors. He makes, for example, no distinction between Ernest
Hemingway, an author who never offers the
slightest critique of the anti-Semitism of his central characters--an
anti-Semitism that he obviously shares--and
Faulkner, whose understanding of the complexities of black as of white
people is of a very different order. Or again,
Hart Crane's touching explanation, made in a letter to his patron Otto
Kahn, that he is having difficulties completing
his long poem <I>The Bridge,</I> whose aim, so the poet claims, is nothing
short of writing "the myth of America," is
simply taken at face value: Crane's "efforts to capture" the myth, we
read, "revolve around the re of a Pocahontas"
(<I>OA,</I> 48). But this is to underplay the intense lyric charge of
<I>The Bridge,</I> its inability to produce "the
myth of America," even as the poet himself is cruelly anatomized.

<P>
History doesn't count, authors don't count, and, perhaps most
problematically, the reader doesn't count. No matter that
99 percent of Faulkner's readers are entranced precisely by the
differences between Jason and Quentin (and Quentin and
Benjy, and Quentin and Caddy) rather than the obvious similarities of the
Compson siblings. No matter that no one
outside the American Studies classroom would so much as read the many
minor ethnic novels that provide Michaels with
his
exempla. In fact, the weight of evidence, the endless plot summarizing and
teasing out of nativist themes becomes quite
tedious, even in this short book. Tedious, that is, until the last ten or
so pages, when the book's polemic thrust is
spelled out, when Michaels unleashes his critique of our own identitarian
moment, a moment in which, all too often, the
"American" past is understood as "the Native American past, the African
American past, the Jewish American past, and so
on." (<I>OA,</I> 128)

<P>
"Why," asks Michaels plaintively, "does it matter who we are?" For


<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The real question . . . is not <I>which </I>past should count as ours but
why <I>any </I>past should count as ours. . .
. the history we study is never our own; it is always the history of
people who were in some respects like us and in
other respects different. When, however, we claim it as ours, we commit
ourselves to the ontology of "the Negro," to
the
identity of "we" and "they" and the primacy of race. [<I>OA, </I>128]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Thus, <I>"instead of who we are being constituted by what we do, what we
do is justified by who we are"</I> (<I>OA,</I>
140; my emphasis). Such pluralism or identity essentialism, Michaels
believes, is itself the thinly veiled racism we
now
practice.

<P>
But to what extent is "who we are" determined by "what we do"? As the
Austrian and German Jews found out by 1932 or
1933, what they "did"--which was pretty much what all other Germans
did--cut no ice with the Nazis, no matter how well
educated, assimilated, baptized, church-going, or blond and blue-eyed they
might have been. And what about Bosnia,
where
the Serbs have brutally murdered and raped women identified simply by the
signifier of gender as <I>women,</I> never
mind what these women had <I>said</I> or <I>done?</I> In an imperfect
world, as the history of our brutal century has
taught us, identity is largely a question of how others perceive us. And
that perception depends, in turn, on a host of
psychological, political, and cultural factors, with each case being
slightly different.

<P>
It is this sense of difference that brings us back--or it should bring us
back--to the question of the <I>literary.</I>
What is literature anyway, and why should we study it? On the last page of
<I>Our America,</I> we read:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
nativist modernism invented a new form of racism and produced a new model
not only of American identity but of the
other
identities that would now be available in America. . . . Because that
conception of culture found its fullest
expression
as a literary phenomenon and (not, in my view, coincidentally) because the
decade of the 20s produced a great number of
exceptionally interesting literary works, I have focused most of my
attention on American literary modernism. Whether
or
not the privileged position of literature as the carrier of cultural
heritage is enviable, it is real and, even though
it would certainly be useful to deal with a range of phenomena wider than
I have attempted, I believe that any account
of nativist modernism would end up making American literary history
central. [<I>OA,</I> 141-42]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The assumptions behind this eloquent conclusion deserve to be unpacked.
Why, to begin with, should "literature" be the
"privileged" "carrier of cultural heritage"? Why not music or the visual
arts or historiography? More important: the
notion of "literature" as a "carrier" (it sounds like a vaccine!) implies
that it dispenses something outside and above
literature that is "real" and can be accessed by means of a verbal
conduit. But what and where is this really real that
the literary vaccine injects?

<P>
"The decade of the 20s," Michaels insists, "produced a great number of
exceptionally interesting literary works." A
strange statement, this, coming from an anti-aestheticist like Michaels.
For what is it that makes "literary works"
"interesting"? And what is it that makes interesting works "literary"?
Since Michaels refuses all qualitative criteria,
confuting, as the dust jacket of <I>Our America</I> puts it, "the
canonical,


<B></B>


the popular, and the less familiar,"
we can only conclude that what makes certain literary works of the 1920s
"exceptionally interesting" is that they
exemplify the nativism that is Michaels's subject. Those works of the
1920s that don't so exemplify--say Stevens's "The
Snow Man" or Crane's "Voyages," or Stein's portrait of Paul
C&eacute;zanne--are evidently not
"exceptionally interesting." And evidently they are not "literary" either
since they are not privileged "carriers" of
the nativist message.

<P>
"I believe," writes Michaels, "that any account of nativist modernism
would end up making American literary history
central." Here is the salvage operation by which Michaels's brand of
cultural studies would like to save literature, to
preserve it as a field of study. But it will not do. For why do we need to
study literature in order to learn about the
identity politics of the 1920s? Surely there are more informative and
efficient ways than to read dozens of what are
largely undistinguished novels. What, in other words, can "literature"
teach us that the study of American history,
culture, and politics can't? Indeed, I would posit that if literature has
no other function than to be the privileged
"carrier of cultural heritage," its study will soon be an anachronism. If
we can offer our students nothing better than
the moral imperative to read the novels of Nella Larsen and Jean Toomer
and Willa Cather because they will teach us
about the "cultural heritage" that they "carry," the response is likely to
be a collective and extended yawn. What
nineteen-year-old will be impelled to read lesser novels written seventy
years ago on that argument?

<P>
The study of literature, modernist or otherwise, needs better
justification than Michaels gives it. The fascination
exerted by, say, <I>The Sound and the Fury</I> is that it is at once
utterly specific and documentary (one can go to
Oxford, Mississippi and photograph the buildings that people Faulkner's
universe) and yet entirely imaginary,
mythological, and fantastic. Insofar as the novel embodies nativist
notions of miscegenation and reproductive marriage,
it resembles the work of any number of lesser novelists, as Michaels
points out. But if we regard the glass as half
full
rather than half empty, we would have to go further and say, Yes, but look
at the astonishing subtlety of Faulkner's
treatment of the nativist theme. Again, if the nativist project were all,
why the astonishing linguistic invention that
characterizes <I>The Sound and the Fury?</I> Why not just substitute a
Cliff Notes pr&eacute;cis for the novel? Surely
the "ideas" remain intact. And at the ideological level, it may well be
the case that Faulkner's novel is no more
"interesting" than La Farge's <I>Laughing Boy,</I> which dates from the
same year .

<P>
Ironically, then, Michaels's contention that the notion of a racialized
identity will emerge as "the crucial feature of
modernism" (<I>OA,</I> 141), is itself nothing if not an essentialist,
indeed an inadvertently racist, claim. For
modernism does not, cannot, belong to the United States alone, much less
to any segment of U. S. culture or decade of
U.
S. writing. Modernism, as I noted above, goes back at least as far as
Baudelaire and Manet in France and includes the
poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and fiction of Andrey Bely at least as much
as it includes the fiction of Hemingway and
Fitzgerald. To cordon off American modernism, not to mention the fiction
of the American 1920s, from the larger world
in
which it functioned is to assume the existence


<B></B>


of a national (and
hence also racial) purity, an ethos that
separates "us" from "them."

<P>
But even if we could define American modernism according to its time
frame, nationality, and set of family
resemblances,
it is impossible to assert that it has one "crucial feature." Michaels
knows this well enough, knows that his
discussion
of nativist modernism has less to do with the 1920s than with what he
perceives to be the regressive identity politics
of our own day. But in insisting that nativism, with its attendant racism
is "the crucial feature" of American
modernism, Michaels is doing no more than perpetuating a narrow stereotype
of Americanness. Broaden the base,
substitute
Gertrude Stein's <I>Geography and Plays</I> for Carl Van Vechten's
<I>Nigger Heaven,</I> or Djuna Barnes's Greenwich
Village sketches and short stories for Sherwood Anderson's <I>Dark
Laughter,</I> and watch the map of American
modernism
change its shape.

<P>
Paradoxically, <I>Our America</I> will thus be of interest chiefly to
those already committed to the racialized
identity
politics Michaels claims to be critiquing. Its prerequisite is a
familiarity with the ethnic literature of the 1920s--a
literature that stakes its claim precisely on racial and cultural grounds.
But for those of us who are not racial
purists and who do not subscribe to the "cultural heritage" theory of
literary texts, <I>Our America</I> is not so much
wrongheaded as it is tautological. Race is always and only race. But then
what? "The difference," as Gertrude Stein
(and, by the way, just what was her racial identity?) put it in <I>Tender
Buttons,</I> "is spreading."

"It was May of the year 1907, the year that was destined to bring the
greatest number of immigrants to the shores of the United
States."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Thus begins Henry Roth's remarkable novel <I>Call It
Sleep, </I>in which we learn of an eight-year-old Jewish boy from Austria,
David Schearl, attempting to find happiness in a land unfamiliar and often
frightening to him. But if this moment early in the novel suggests that
David's difficulties will derive chiefly from his encounter with an
America hostile to him as an immigrant and a Jew, the rest of the novel
often complicates that idea. Moments after David's story is provisionally
situated within the narrative of early-twentieth-century American
immigration, we are told that when compared with other immigrant families,
there was "something quite untypical" about the Schearls (<I>CS,</I> 11).
We soon learn that their singularity consists in the tension that divides
the family: seeing each other for the first time in years, David's parents
"stood silent, apart; the man staring with aloof, offended eyes grimly
down at the water. . . . And his wife beside him regarding him uneasily,
appealingly. And the child against her breast looking from one to the
other with watchful, frightened eyes" (<I>CS,</I> 11). Here as elsewhere
in the novel, the idea that David's problems will spring from his
experience with a hostile nation is confused by the degree to which the
problems appear instead to emanate from his experience with his family.

<P>
The very suggestion that David's unhappiness might stem from something
other than a clash between two cultures distinguishes


<B></B>


<I>Call It
Sleep </I>from the genre of ethnic novel out of which it grows. Roth began
writing his novel in 1930, just weeks after the immense success of Michael
Gold's <I>Jews Without Money. </I>And as Marcus Klein has pointed out, the
success of Gold's memoir of Jewish life on the Lower East Side of New York
appears to have been crucial to Roth's decision to make his own immigrant
experience central to his literary efforts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Yet the characters
that appear in <I>Jews Without Money </I>are routinely understood to
suffer because the land to which they have come has deprived them of their
cultural or ethnic heritage. Mikey Gold, the young boy at the center of
Gold's narrative, is pointedly made to suffer the humiliation of his
American schoolteachers calling him "Little Kike," and he finds himself
happy only when enveloped by a Lower East Side that he calls "this
remarkable dream of a million Jews."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Giving the young boy the
advice that the novel often offers its imagined audience, Rabbi Samuel
tells Mikey that in the future, he must be mindful of his "tradition," and
that he must "be true to it" (<I>JM,</I> 192). And though the reflective
narrator claims to have found the advice "weird" at the time, he insists
that nevertheless "something deep inside of me responded to it"
(<I>JM,</I> 194).

<P>
<I>Jews Without Money </I>ultimately develops a more complicated account
of its characters' sufferings than this description suggests, and I will
eventually return to the nature of those complications. But it is of more
immediate importance to note that in its assertion of a cultural identity
distinguished from that associated with America, Gold's novel follows the
lead of the Jewish novel of cultural conflict as established most clearly
by Anzia Yezierska's <I>Bread Givers </I>. In Yezierska's novel the
central conflict is between Sara Smolinsky, a young Jew whose desire to
become one of the "real Americans" is so intense that successful
Americanization seems to her the equivalent of being "changed into a
person," and her father, whose embodiment of Jewishness is so absolute
that to his family he seems "an ancient prophet that had just stepped out
of the Bible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 In the course of the novel, Sara's desire to
become an American leads her, against her father's wishes, to refuse an
arranged marriage and to pursue her goal of becoming a public
schoolteacher. But instead of making her happy, Sara's achievements leave
her "empty" (<I>BG,</I> 269), and it is only when she returns to her
father and marries a fellow Jew who is interested in learning the Hebrew
he neglected as a child that Sara is understood to have achieved a kind of
fulfillment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
If <I>Bread Givers</I> or <I>Jews Without Money</I> is representative of
the tradition of the Jewish novel from which <I>Call It Sleep</I> emerges,
we can describe that tradition by saying that within it, the assertion of
a cultural or ancestral identity serves chiefly as a repudiation of
American assimilation. In both <I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>Jews Without
Money,</I> to embrace one's cultural or old-world identity as a Jew is to
reject Americanization. It has recently been argued that the rejection of
assimilation evident in these novels is best understood in relation to an
earlier repudiation of assimilation on the part of mainstream American
cultural agents, notably the modern American novel. Seizing on how novels
as different as <I>The Professor's House</I> , <I>The Great
Gatsby</I> ,


<B></B>


and <I>The Sun Also Rises</I>  imagine
belonging or group membership to be a function of who you are rather than
what you do, Walter Benn Michaels has argued that the American novel of
the 1920s participated in a wide-ranging reconstruction of American
citizenship on the restrictive grounds of identity rather than
behavior.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 As a function of what you do, American citizenship
and identity are available to those who would acquire them by way of
assimilation; as a function of who you are, in some genealogical sense,
they become unavailable to precisely those who could only acquire them in
that way.

<P>
As a number of historians of the period have suggested, the interest that
these novels have in rethinking the terms of American identity derives
from an increasing anxiety in the early 1920s over the numbers of
immigrants arriving on American shores.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In 1924, that anxiety
culminated with the passage of the Johnson Immigration Act, which limited
the number of immigrants allowed into the United States to one hundred and
fifty thousand a year, as opposed to the approximately one million a year
of the period immediately preceding World War I. In a speech to the
National Education Association given soon after the bill passed, Calvin
Coolidge articulated the link between concerns over immigration and
concerns over American identity by citing the Johnson Act as his
administration's chief accomplishment in the effort to help America
"remain American."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Proceeding to inform his audience as to
what they might do to further that project, Coolidge promoted an emphasis
on "the teachings of history" (<I>AN,</I> 37) that would illuminate how
different nations "cling to their customs" (<I>AN,</I> 37), and he
particularly exhorted his audience to make an effort to work themselves
into the past to "search out and think the thoughts of those who
established our institutions" (<I>AN,</I> 56). In Professor St. Peter,
Nick Carraway, and Nick Adams--three fictive Americans clearly drawn to
the past--it is easy to see three res of whom Coolidge would have
approved. And the famous concluding scene of <I>The Great Gatsby,</I> with
its transformation of Nick's eyes into "Dutch sailors' eyes" seeing once
again the "vanished trees" of the "fresh, green breast of the new world,"
is as true to Coolidge's exhortation to recover an original American
experience as one could imagine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
But as novels like <I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>Jews Without Money</I>
suggest, the repudiation of assimilation articulated in the 1920s could be
affirmed by immigrants as well as by "natives"; the project of recovering
and embracing an ancestral past could be undertaken by immigrants like
Sara Smolinsky and Mikey Gold as well as by res like Nick Carraway and
Nick Adams. Indeed, attending to the terms in which the work of immigrant
writers like Yezierska and Gold was often received means recognizing the
degree to which the genre had as one of its central aims the preservation
of an ancestral or cultural experience perceived as endangered precisely
as a result of the assaults of assimilation. In her introduction to
<I>Bread Givers,</I> Alice Kessler Harris observes that the novel takes
great care "to evoke vividly the religion and tradition of the
shtetl."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Similarly, <I>Jews Without Money</I> conforms to the
pattern when it slows to document, in loving detail, what communal
gatherings were like for Jews on the


<B></B>


Lower East Side, recalling
tables laden with such delicacies as "the sponge cake, the herring, the
quince jam, the apples, <I>kraut knishes,</I> fried fish and cheese
blintzes . . . the fiery Polish <I>slivovitz,</I> the <I>wishniak,</I> the
plum brandy, the Roumanian wine" (<I>JM,</I> 21).

<P>
It may have been this aspect of the immigrant or ethnic novel that led a
representative fan of <I>Call It Sleep</I> like Leslie Fiedler to describe
that novel as the best example we have in American literature of an
immigrant "caught between two cultures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 But as I have
suggested, <I>Call It Sleep</I> resists being understood in terms of the
model of cultural conflict developed in so many of the novels from which
it draws. Its resistance is first registered in those scenes where David's
suffering is understood to derive less from his experiences with a hostile
nation and more from his experiences with a divided family. Very early in
the narrative, we are invited to consider the obvious tension between
David's parents to be his greatest problem, a consideration that quickly
acquires force in a scene in which David's father beats him while the boy
cries out, "Please, papa! Please! No more! No more! Darling papa! Darling
papa!" (<I>CS,</I> 84). In <I>Jews Without Money,</I> the family is
routinely understood as a cultural refuge that the immigrant can seek when
assaulted by the new world and its hostile culture. In <I>Call It
Sleep,</I> the family is itself one of the most powerful sources of the
immigrant's suffering, and David is depicted less as a child caught
between two cultures than between two parents.

<P>
And yet it would not be entirely accurate to say that <I>Call It Sleep</I>
traces its hero's sufferings to his family rather than to his experiences
with a world beyond it; David repeatedly suffers from experiences that
originate outside of his family, and that ultimately have nothing to do
with his mother or father. One of the first and most memorable of these is
his experience with a young immigrant girl who initiates him into the
mysteries of sex: wishing to play along while Annie outlines a new game,
David agrees to "play bad" until he discovers that this means sliding his
hand under her dress to feel "her skin under his palm" (<I>CS,</I> 53).
Horrified, he flees, and for the rest of the novel he expends a good deal
of energy trying to suppress the memory of an experience that threatens to
overwhelm him, to reduce the world to "a thousand little pieces, all
buzzing, all whining, and no one hearing them and no one seeing them
except himself" (<I>CS,</I> 55).

<P>
Annie, however, is only the beginning; throughout Roth's novel, David has
experiences that originate outside of his family, and that occasion in him
the same kind of suffering. In this light, it is more accurate to say that
David's difficulties are traced to a hostile environment that includes,
but extends beyond, his family. This links <I>Call It Sleep</I> even more
closely to <I>Jews Without Money,</I> to the distinct variation that that
novel works on the immigrant drama of cultural identity central to a novel
like <I>Bread Givers.</I> That is, immigrants in <I>Jews Without Money</I>
suffer because they have been both culturally and <I>economically</I>
deprived. The mindless cruelty of the young boys at the center of Gold's
narrative is repeatedly seen to derive from the boys' detachment from
their ethnic past, <I>and</I> from the degree to which they have been
forced to live in a slum world of "violence and stone," a place where
there are "too many cats"


<B></B>


and "too many children" (<I>JM,</I> 63). At
such moments, <I>Jews Without Money</I> develops a distinctly class-based
argument that accompanies its cultural argument concerning the suffering
of its protagonists. And insofar as David's world in <I>Call It Sleep</I>
is indeed the ghetto outlined in <I>Jews Without Money,</I> Roth's novel
extends the line of argument found in Gold's novel to suggest that its
hero is caught not simply between two cultures, or even between two
parents, but most crucially between two classes, the rich and the poor.

<P>
Just such a reading accounts for the other major avenue by which <I>Call
It Sleep</I> has come to be appreciated. In addition to being lauded as a
novel of culture that captures "Jewish life," Roth's work is routinely
praised as a narrative of class that captures what it means for a young
boy to be "exposed, shock by shock, to the blows of slum
life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 And yet here too <I>Call It Sleep</I> resists the
models of understanding that so clearly apply to other novels in the
tradition of immigrant fiction from which it draws. In <I>Jews Without
Money,</I> the suffering of young children is routinely understood as
occasioned by experiences highly specific to ghetto life; young girls, for
example, are forced by the need for money and the absence of economic
opportunity into prostitution (<I>JM,</I> 31). In <I>Call It Sleep,</I>
however, David's sufferings are traced to experiences difficult to call
ghetto-specific. Early in the novel, for instance, David encounters a
funeral while on his way home from school. Realizing what he is seeing, he
is reduced to a familiar "sense of desolation" (<I>CS,</I> 61). While
there is little doubt here that David lives in a ghetto and that he
suffers, funerals occur outside ghettos as well as inside them; they are
not specific to ghetto life.

<P>
How, then, are we to understand the desolation from which David suffers?
Or, more immediately, how does the novel understand this desolation to
resist narratives of cultural, familial, and economic deprivation? David's
encounter with the funeral leads to an exchange with his mother in which,
in response to her asking him what is wrong, he replies quietly, "I don't
know" (<I>CS,</I> 62). He wonders about a "dreamlike fugitive sadness"
that possesses him; he is haunted by visions of a world, a standard by
which everything in the actual world is found either wanting or assaultive
(<I>CS,</I> 68). Later, after another experience in which he has been
reduced to his familiar despair, David identifies this utopianism as the
source of his suffering. "Just don't believe," he counsels himself,
attempting to suppress his tendency to see a world other than the one that
confronts him; "don't believe, never" (<I>CS,</I> 116). "But," he goes on
to wonder, "when would that queer weight, that odd something lodged in his
bosom, that was so spiny, ramified, reminding, when would that vanish?
Tomorrow, maybe? Maybe tomorrow" (<I>CS,</I> 116). Here, as at other
moments, David's suffering is imagined to stem from some obscure and inner
sense he has of how the world might otherwise be, a "fugitive" sense that
the world he inhabits offends at every turn. And here, as elsewhere, David
imagines that if he could escape that sense, he might escape the cycle of
hope and despair that his experience has become.

<P>
Throughout <I>Call It Sleep,</I> though, that hope is positioned beyond
realization, and it is precisely this fact that accounts for David's
failure not only to be like the other boys in the street, but to become an
American. The other immigrant children who


<B></B>


appear are routinely
presented as enthusiastic students of the new world into which they have
been thrown; they study how to make their way in it, and in the process
become "this new breed[:] . . . Americans" (<I>CS,</I> 374). By contrast,
David is indifferent. Early in the novel, a boy in his neighborhood finds
an abandoned clock on the street. He dismantles it to recover a cog that
resembles a coin, and that thus might be used in a "slod machine" to get
gum (<I>CS,</I> 21). When he invites David to join him in retrieving the
prize, David's indifference causes the boy to eye him "curiously," and
after "shrugging off his perplexity," he leaves David alone (<I>CS,</I>
22). Because his mind is tuned to the fugitive sense of an alternative
world he carries about with him, David is construed as fundamentally
indifferent, and that indifference is understood to keep him from becoming
Americanized.

<P>
Eventually, and perhaps inevitably, David's indifference is identified by
the neighborhood rabbi as a sign of his true Jewishness, since it is taken
as a sign of his resistance to the forces of assimilation destroying
"Yiddish youth" (<I>CS,</I> 374). But it is important to note the way in
which Roth's novel goes out of its way to resist this view of David's
behavior. Readers of <I>Call It Sleep</I> will recall the extreme degree
to which David is understood to be his mother's rather than his father's
son: the young boy's nature is his mother's, not his father's, and there
is actually some question early in the narrative as to who his actual
biological father is. The other candidate is the "goy" (<I>CS,</I> 196)
Genya met and fell in love with in Austria, and though the situation is
eventually clarified, the force of the story depends less upon whether it
changes David's actual parentage than on the way it illuminates the son's
nature by way of revealing the mother's.

<P>
In the story in question, Genya is revealed to have been a romantic and an
idealist--therefore a problematic Jew. In pursuing her instinctive sense
of love and what marriage might be, as opposed to the more traditional
sense conveyed to her by her parents, Genya finds herself in love with a
Christian; thus, at the very moment she is understood to have satisfied
her basic nature, she is understood as a fallen Jew. As the less
idealistic sister, Bertha explicates the position of the Jewish community
on this question, "even if he was educated . . . and even if he was an
organist, he was a goy!" (<I>CS,</I> 196). At this and other points in
Roth's novel, Genya is clearly understood to be an idealist, responsive
less to the world as she finds it than to the world as she imagines it.
And at this and other points her idealism is understood to complicate, not
complement, her status as a Jew.

<P>
David's situation is rendered similarly: like his mother, he is less
responsive to the world he finds than to some alternative world he senses.
And like his mother, David undergoes an experience in which he discovers
he is a fallen Jew at precisely the moment he most satisfies his nature.
Late in the novel David meets a young Polish immigrant, a Christian, named
Leo. Because Leo's description of Christ evokes for David the image of an
even more powerful agent of world reconstruction than the Hebrew God he
has heard about in cheder, David instinctively asks the boy for the
scapular hanging around his neck. At this moment David vaguely recognizes
that his act involves "betraying all the Jews in his house" (<I>CS,</I>
306). But the desire that animates


<B></B>


his act--the desire to bring into
being a world other than the one that exists--is sufficiently strong to
override that concern. David is as idealistic as his mother, and again
that idealism is understood to make David a problematic Jew.

<P>
The novel's resistance to interpreting idealism as a sign of Jewishness is
nowhere more clearly dramatized than in the rabbi's repeatedly emphasized
misunderstanding of David's interest in his studies at cheder. While
David's proficiency in Hebrew studies is understood by his rabbi to
indicate a profound and rare interest in discovering "what it means to be
a Jew" (<I>CS,</I> 210), it is repeatedly construed as a function of the
quite different desire to learn about, and make contact with, a power
capable of first destroying and then refashioning the world. The Jewish
lore that the rabbi understands David to seek as an end in itself is, in
other words, routinely presented merely as a means to an end, an end the
boy clearly articulates when he asks his mother whether the God he has
heard of in cheder is capable of "breaking up" the world (<I>CS,</I> 241).
To the rabbi, then, David's indifference to the world around him is a sign
of his Jewishness, a sign of his resistance to the process of assimilation
that is "Americanization." But to the novel, that indifference is
understood to make David a failed or problematic Jew, as well as a failed
American.

<P>
To observe that David and his mother are both understood to be failed
Americans as well as problematic Jews is to note the degree to which
<I>Call It Sleep</I> rejects the opposition between American and Jew so
central to texts of the 1920s as different as <I>Bread Givers</I> and
Willa Cather's <I>The Professor's House.</I> In <I>Call It Sleep</I> that
opposition is converted into something like an identity, for Jews and
Americans are vaguely identified in terms of being able to accept and
adapt to the world in a way that neither Genya nor David can manage. In
entertaining a link between the identities of Jews and Americans, <I>Call
It Sleep</I> is following another lead established by <I>Jews Without
Money</I> in adapting another variation on the tradition of the immigrant
novel to which <I>Bread Givers</I> belongs. For in Gold's novel, true Jews
are understood to be true Americans, on the grounds that like true
Americans, true Jews are hard-working and adaptive. The qualification
"true" that precedes both "Jews" and "Americans" in this description is
important, because Gold's narrative is populated with false Jews as well
as false Americans, and sorting out the difference is vital to the work of
the novel.

<P>
Early in Gold's novel a distinction is established between the Americans
whom immigrants confront and the America that the Founding Fathers
imagined. The immigrants are confronted by Americans who are lazy,
overfed, and exploitative. The Founding Fathers, on the other hand, are
understood to have been hard-working individualists trying to make a place
for others like themselves. The immigrants in the novel can thus maintain
the paradoxical position of blasting contemporary America while becoming
emotional when at one point young Mikey sings:

[<I>JM,</I> 120].

<P>
<B></B>

<P>
Similarly, a distinction is drawn between true and false Jews, with the
former understood as hard-working and resourceful, while the latter are
seen as overprivileged and lazy. Mikey's mother, who holds several jobs
while caring for the sick in her building, is thus dramatically contrasted
with the overfed and discontented wife of a Jewish businessman, who is
described as "a typical wife of a Jewish <I>nouveau riche</I>" (<I>JM,</I>
217).

<P>
The identification of true Jews with true Americans that <I>Jews Without
Money</I> posits is most neatly articulated by Mikey's elision of Buffalo
Bill with the messiah. Having roamed outside of his neighborhood and into
the province of Italian boys hostile to Jews, Mikey imagines that

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

it was like the Wild West. Under the fierce sky Buffalo Bill and I chased
buffalo over the vast plains. . . . Then a secret message was sent to us
from a beautiful white maiden. She was a prisoner in the camp of the

time we saved her. . . . We escaped with the white girl, and rode and rode
and rode. . . . [<I>JM,</I> 187]
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As a Jew surrounded by hostile elements, young Mikey imagines himself as
allied with Buffalo Bill: both are rugged individualists, and both are
underdogs instinctively opposed to oppression.

<P>
In linking Jews and Americans <I>Jews Without Money</I> depends upon a
shift in how both forms of identity are conceived. For if Jewish and
American identities are conceived in terms of an ancestral past, as they
are in texts such as <I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>The Professor's House,</I>
then Jews cannot be Americans and Americans cannot be Jews, for the pasts
they are understood to possess are clearly different. In order for the
link to be made, the identities in question must be grounded differently.
The shift in question involves a move away from the idea of shared
ancestry or culture, and toward the idea of a shared disposition or
psychology. For what enables the identification of Mikey with Buffalo Bill
is a shared psychology: a sense of independence and resourcefulness in the
face of perceived difficulty. Their pasts have nothing in common. The
terms by which the Jew and the American are here identified indicate not
only the emergence of new conceptions of American citizenship and theories
of national identity in the 1930s, but also the particular concerns that
ground this shift.

<P>
In 1925 Maxwell Telling, an educator and self-declared patriot, announced
that those concerned with the future of America should take time to
understand not their culture but their psychology, not the experiences of
their ancestors but "the psychological experience of their
children."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Telling's argument was based on the premise that
the challenge facing America was not immigration, as Coolidge and others
had suggested, but economic progress. For Telling, World War I had
accelerated the national economy to the point that it was in danger of
exhausting those who would consume its products. The study to which
Telling's remarks served as an introduction, <I>Childhood's Fears:
Psychoanalysis and the Inferiority-Fear Complex</I> , went on



<B></B>


to argue that fear was the privileged experience in relation to which
parents must now raise their children; its presence or absence would
determine whether a child would become an "extrovert" or an "introvert,"
that is to say, an individual capable of embracing and adapting to the
world around him, or an individual paralyzed by that world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

For Telling and G. F. Morton, the author of the study, resourcefulness or
adaptability was the hallmark of a healthy human being <I>and a good
citizen,</I> and parents were urged to take special care to promote those
qualities in their children at a time when, as Morton put it, "material
civilization is going ahead so swiftly that man seems to be losing control
of the machinery owing to his own relatively slower advance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P>
The displacement of culture by psychology in the nationalist discourse
represented by Telling and Morton turns upon the displacement of racial or
ethnic concerns by concerns more specifically economic. The distinction
invoked here between culture and psychology, race and economics, is
complicated. It is arguable that the race-thinking of the 1920s in America
and other nations is economically motivated, and that the concern with
"culture" evident in that period is no less an economic issue than
depression unemployment. Moreover, it is arguable that the concern with
adaptability that marks the 1930s is racially inflected (John Steinbeck's
<I>The Grapes of Wrath</I> would be a case in point), and that the
psychological discourse emergent in the decade is thus less distinct from
the cultural exclusions of the 1920s than might appear. From this
perspective, it seems well advised to take account of the strategic
rhetorical nature of the distinction between culture and psychology or
race and economics invoked by Telling and others. And indeed, to do so is
to focus even more directly on the quite real effects that such
distinctions produced in American narratives.

<P>
From this vantage point, while culture became definitive grounds for
American citizenship and identity when the challenge facing the nation was
perceived to be racial or ethnic, psychology emerged as a basis for these
things when the nation confronted a more specifically economic challenge.
We would then expect to find the kind of nationalist discourse represented
by Telling and Morton becoming more prominent than that represented by
Coolidge in situations where economic concerns were perceived to outweigh,
or at least compete with, racial and ethnic concerns. No moment in
American history exemplifies such a situation better than the depression
of the 1930s, and it is in fact in the context of the Great Depression and
its emergent concerns that one can begin to grasp the force of the
identification between Jew and American that distinguishes a text like
<I>Jews Without Money.</I>

<P>
The Great Depression was only getting underway when <I>Jews Without
Money</I> was published, but Michael Gold had long viewed America and its
concerns in economic terms. As a founding editor of <I>The New Masses,</I>
Gold was interested in elaborating a new critique of contemporary America,
and in <I>Jews Without Money</I> it becomes clear that the kind of
nationalist discourse practiced by Morton and Telling in many ways opened
the door for him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 To a re like Gold, the initial appeal
of the discourse


<B></B>


of disposition and psychology lay in its rejection
of the criteria that prevented all immigrants and most workers from
considering themselves central to the nation. And insofar as this
discourse insisted instead upon the centrality of a proper psychological
disposition, immigrants and workers became as likely to be "true
Americans" as the owners and natives with whom they were typically
contrasted.

<P>
Moreover, in its particular insistence upon the virtues of resourcefulness
and adaptability, the discourse in question allowed Gold to suggest that
the experience of immigrants and workers made them in fact <I>more</I>
likely to be true Americans than the natives or owners. In his
introduction to <I>Jews Without Money,</I> Gold attacks Nazi rhetoric as
it had begun to take hold in Weimar Germany--not on the grounds that it
was wrong to blame capitalists and "international bankers" for
contemporary social ills, but because it had mistakenly identified Jews
with these capitalists. "The great mass of Jews in the world today," Gold
argued vehemently, "are not millionaire bankers, but paupers and workers"
(<I>JM,</I> 6). As "paupers and workers," Jews in Gold's novel possess
precisely the virtues of resourcefulness and adaptability that Telling and
Morton use to identify their true patriots. And in the course of the
narrative, Jewish immigrants are thus imagined to be not just part of an
America from which they had previously been excluded, but the very heart
of the nation, in that they are conceived to possess precisely the
originary qualities needed to rejuvenate a crippled economy.

<P>
Public interest in ghetto experience, which was quite small during the
1920s, exploded during the depression, as several historians have
suggested; this accounts in large part for the astonishing success of
novels of hardship like <I>Jews Without Money,</I> James T. Farrell's
<I>Studs Lonigan</I> , and <I>The Grapes of Wrath</I>
.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 From this perspective, it seems clear why <I>Call It
Sleep</I> follows <I>Jews Without Money</I> in collapsing the opposition
between Jew and American so central to so many novels of the 1920s. Begun
in 1930 and published four years later, Roth's novel simply assumes that
the experience of becoming an American should be understood as a
psychological drama rather than engaged as a cultural drama of
assimilation. The failure in <I>Call It Sleep</I> of David and his mother
to be simultaneously Americans and Jews is understood as deriving
precisely from their failure to adapt to the world into which they have
been thrown.

<P>
And yet, although <I>Call It Sleep</I> follows <I>Jews Without Money</I>
in rejecting the opposition between Jew and American, it diverges from the
path of Gold's novel by marginalizing precisely those res who do adapt
to and overcome the hardships with which they are presented. In contrast
to Mikey's mother, David's mother is never employed outside the home, and
creates for herself and her son an environment defined expressly by the
absence of those challenges that mark the world beyond their apartment
door. And in contrast to Mikey, David avoids the world. Roth's novel,
then, precisely <I>reverses</I> the terms of Gold's novel, celebrating
exactly the psychological proclivities Gold identifies as at once
anti-American and anti-Jewish. I will eventually argue that in doing so
<I>Call It Sleep</I> employs the high-modern ration of the irreducibly
alienated subject to construct, within a depression-era cultural discourse
in


<B></B>


which Americanness was increasingly a matter of resourcefulness,
an alternative to the idea that good Americans were defined by the
flexibility with which they responded to the hardships of the depression.
At present, since the reversal that Roth's novel effects is conducted in
terms of the novel's celebration of David, the meaning of that reversal is
best grasped by examining the nature of that celebration.

<P>
Throughout the novel, David is distinguished from other immigrant children
not only by his revulsion to the world as he finds it, but by the degree
to which his mind is constantly engaged in the business of considering and
reconsidering the elements of experience. At home or wandering the
streets, David is imagined to be "sifting the mind's trinkets": "Was
wondering. Birds? Not birds. Bad words? No. Before that. When? Aunt
Bertha, the new man? No. Can't find. Funny. Maybe his name? Mr.--Mr. What.
Yes. Maybe. No--But . . ." (<I>CS,</I> 174). The content of the sifting
represented here--David is mulling over the pieces of the puzzle that is
his mother's past--is less important than the degree to which David is
identified throughout the novel with this kind of mental activity, for in
that identification lies the novel's most privileged understanding of its
young hero. Insofar as he is possessed by an "odd something" (<I>CS,</I>
116) that makes him less responsive to the external world than to an
internal one, David is imagined, like his mother, to be an idealist.
Insofar as he also possesses a desire to take in hand the disparate
aspects of his experience and to refashion them in accordance with that
other world, David is also understood to be an artist, and <I>Call It
Sleep</I> reemerges as a portrait of the artist as a young man.

<P>
Readers of <I>Call It Sleep</I> have long observed affinities between
Roth's work and Joyce's, and Roth himself identified Joyce as one of the
most powerful models behind <I>Call It Sleep.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The
techniques used to represent the workings of David's mind are clearly
indebted to techniques employed in <I>Ulysses</I> , and the
concluding scene of Roth's novel, where narrative techniques give way to
theatrical conventions, is obviously indebted to the Nighttown episode of
Joyce's novel. And yet, in addition to these affinities, there is the less
often remarked matter of David's resemblance to the image of the modern
artist that a novel like <I>Ulysses</I> projects. That image, which <I>The
Waste Land</I> could also be understood to project, is that of a man
sifting through the detritus of the world to see whether it might be
refashioned under the sign of some coherence or redemption. In a
discussion of Joyce, Eliot, and modernism, Roth claimed that
<I>Ulysses,</I> like <I>The Waste Land,</I> had shown him that "literature
[could] be created out of junk."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 And insofar as the young boy
at the center of <I>Call It Sleep</I> is distinguished by his tendency to
sift through "the trinkets of his mind" with an eye to coherence and
redemption--insofar as he is distinguished by precisely the tendency
associated with artistry in the work of Joyce and Eliot--the novel not
only paints a portrait of the artist as a young man, but paints a quite
specific portrait of the <I>modern</I> artist as a young man.

<P>
This tracing of literary influences brings to light the double, and
conflicted, genealogy of <I>Call It Sleep.</I> On the one hand it is
clearly indebted to the tradition of the immigrant novel represented by
<I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>Jews Without Money;</I> on the


<B></B>


other hand
the novel is just as clearly indebted to the modernism represented by
<I>Ulysses</I> and <I>The Waste Land.</I> The tradition of modernism
represented by Joyce and Eliot is often understood to have assumed as its
normative perspective the position of a subject with distinct privileges
of class and culture, privileges that at times revealed themselves in
moments of explicit anti-Semitism (think of Eliot's "Gerontion"). By
contrast, the tradition of the immigrant novel is often understood to have
assumed as its normative perspective the position of a subject deprived of
precisely the privileges that Eliot's modernism assumes. Moreover, in
adopting this latter perspective, the immigrant or ethnic novel is
frequently understood to entail a progressive politics that would insist
on including in public discourse precisely the voices that Eliot's
modernism excludes. To write a novel of immigrant experience in the
tradition of Yezierska and Gold is in this sense a politically progressive
act, although fashioning that work according to some of the central tenets
of what we have come to call high modernism might seem to defeat, or at
least complicate, that very purpose.

<P>
The novel's involvement with modernism is manifest in its concluding
scene, in which David stumbles toward an electrified streetcar rail, iron
milk ladle in hand, intending to draw from the rail the sparks he
understands to confirm the existence of a divine being possessed of
reconstructive powers. In addition to suggesting that David is driven to
this act by the "queer weight" (<I>CS,</I> 116) that distinguishes him
from others in the novel, the scene unfolds by juxtaposing David's
thoughts with the speech of various characters who inhabit the murky world
through which he moves, producing an effect similar to that achieved in
the Nighttown episode of <I>Ulysses,</I> or to the polyvocal pastiche of
<I>The Waste Land.</I> In a typical speech, a laborer named O'Toole
delivers himself as follows:

<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In one sense, Roth's readers have been right to focus on the affinities
between Roth's work and that of Joyce or Eliot. But to restrict the
critical attention to the narrative's formal features--especially in the
presence of speeches like O'Toole's--is to ignore the suddenly heightened
vulgarity of the characters whose actions are juxtaposed to David's.
Indeed, speeches like O'Toole's are suddenly offered toward the end of the
novel in order to display the degree to which the inhabitants of the
ghetto in which David finds himself have been degraded by the conditions
in which they are forced to live.


<B></B>

<P>
For most of its nearly five hundred pages, <I>Call It Sleep</I> has seemed
far less concerned than <I>Jews Without Money</I> and other novels of its
kind to focus on the nightmarish aspects of the ghetto that its
protagonist inhabits. I have suggested that this derives from the novel's
resistance to reducing its hero's sufferings to membership in a particular
class. In its final pages, however, Roth's narrative presents the ghetto
in as unflattering a light as any depicted in other immigrant novels, and
David's flight to the rail is clearly seen as deriving less from an
idiosyncratic nature than from the direct effects of his surroundings,
which he has perceived more acutely than anyone else. Moreover, the
novel's desire to suggest that the condition of the people it depicts
derives from a systematic problem with the nation to which they have come
is made explicit by a voice that is raised above the din to exclaim, "And
do you know, you can go all the way up inside her for twenty-five cents.
For only twenty-five cents, mind you! Every American man, woman and child
ought to go up inside her, it's a thrilling experience. The statue of
liberty is--" (<I>CS,</I> 415).

<P>
The statue of liberty appears here as defiled and defiling, and the nation
that the statue represents appears as degraded and degrading. In this
moment <I>Call It Sleep</I> establishes an explicitly national context for
David's actions. Or, to put this point differently, in this moment <I>Call
It Sleep</I> brings together its modernism and its politics. Indeed,
Roth's novel invites us here to understand David's drive to the rail in
the context of a critique of America that calls for revolution on the
grounds that the nation has arrived at the point of systematically
betraying the promises made to its citizens. In case there is any
possibility of missing this, we are given the final words that float
through David's mind the moment before he hits the rail: "Machine!
Liberty! Revolt! Redeem!" (<I>CS,</I> 419) And in case we are inclined to
miss that moment's significance, it becomes manifest in the description of
the consequences of David's act. As he hits the rail we are told that all
around him "a long burst of flame spurted from underground, growled as if
the veil of the earth were splitting" (<I>CS,</I> 420). The apocalyptic
tone of this passage is unmistakable, and its revolutionary impact is
extended once we recognize that, in addition to producing the sparks that
he associates with divine presence, David has interrupted at this moment
the electrical power flowing to, and sustaining, the routinized world of
the immigrant laborers around him. At the moment he does so the laborers
turn toward him--they snap out of the haze in which they exist--to
experience a moment of unusual and possibly significant reflection. "The
masses," we are told, "stood suddenly mute a moment, for a moment silent,
stricken, huddled, crushed by the pounce of night" (<I>CS,</I> 422).

<P>
We are to understand that it is precisely David's inability to adapt
himself to any aspect of the world that has led to this potentially
transformative moment. Throughout <I>Call It Sleep,</I> David has been
differentiated from others in terms of that inability. It now becomes
clear that the capacity to find one's way in the world is an obstacle, not
an avenue, to meaningful change. The workers surrounding David are
immigrant boys grown up, immigrants whose adaptation to the world has
resulted in finding places within it. But their social niches have
violated, not secured, their interests. By contrast, David's
<I>inability</I> to accommodate himself to the world is
understood


<B></B>


 at
the end of the novel to have brought him to the point of ring in the
genuinely revolutionary possibility of redirecting a power currently
engaged in sustaining the world to secure that world's destruction.

<P>
This is to suggest that, in the end, Roth's novel appropriates the
modernist celebration of the alienated subject and turns it not to
conservative or apolitical ends, but to distinctly progressive, even
radical, ones. The final scene of <I>Call It Sleep</I> employs the
high-modern ration of the irreducibly alienated subject in order at
once to <I>engage</I> a depression-era cultural discourse in which
Americanness was increasingly understood as a matter of adaptation, and to
construct <I>within that discourse</I> an alternative to the idea that
good Americans were defined by the skill and resourcefulness with which
they responded to economic hardships. In <I>Jews Without Money,</I>
adaptation is seized upon as a criterion for Americanness because it is
understood to allow for the inclusion of those subjects--immigrants and
ethnics--previously excluded from mainstream American discourse;
adaptation is understood to constitute the basis of a progressive
politics. In <I>The Grapes of Wrath</I> and other depression-era novels of
its kind, the same criterion is embraced because it can include the poor
in American discourse, and is similarly capable of inaugurating a
revolutionary movement. In <I>Call It Sleep,</I> however, adaptation is
rejected as a form of insidious incorporation; paralysis is embraced as a
precipatory form of extreme alienation that can trigger the coming into
being of a nation genuinely receptive to its citizen's concerns.

<P>
We can see, then, how Roth's text imagines the two traditions from which
it draws, high modernism and the novel of immigrant experience, to
complement each other. Indeed, Roth's novel imagines the modernist
celebration of the irreducibly alienated subject--the subject alienated,
in this case, expressly beyond the available therapeutics of cultural or
class identification--as constituting an extension of precisely the kind
of politics widely associated in the period with the embrace of classed,
raced, or cultured subjects. <I>Call It Sleep</I> resists narrative
patterns that locate David's suffering in his alienation from his culture
or class. And we have seen, when considering the degree to which David is
defined in the novel in terms of his sifting mind, how this resistance is
bound up with the novel's interest in rendering David as an artist. Yet
while David is thus presented as an artist rather than as a "Jew" or a
"worker"--while David's experience and suffering are thus presented in
precisely the way that an identification of him as a Jew or a worker would
resist--this characteristic is understood to make David more rather than
less politically progressive. Precisely insofar as he is understood as
resistant to the available identifications of ethnicity and class, David
is red as an agent of revolutionary change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P>
The logic of <I>Call It Sleep</I> raises a number of concluding questions,
the first of which concerns the novel's judgment of the relationship
between a certain kind of modernism and a particular kind of radicalism.
Indeed, the celebration of resistance or paralysis evident in <I>Call It
Sleep</I> speaks to ongoing debates about the political value of
resistance or oppositionalism <I>as such</I> that increasingly animate
contemporary arguments about the kinds of cultural work that have a right
to be called progressive, and the kinds that don't.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 From one
of the two perspectives that dominate this


<B></B>


debate, the resistance
to identification celebrated in <I>Call It Sleep</I> represents an evasion
of the world of social and political affairs. Such resistance is seen as
an evasion of the sphere of "interests" with which the world of social and
political affairs is identified.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 From the other perspective,
the resistance in question is the basis of any genuine indictment of the
world; a resistance to accepting interests formulated in, and thus
complicit with, the world is taken to indicate a genuine opposition to the
current order of things.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P>
The dispute thus turns upon different theories of transformation or
change, and upon the place assigned within those theories to ideas of
exteriority or totality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 And although it is not within the
scope of this essay to resolve this debate, a concluding observation
regarding it is in order. In recovering the claim put forward in <I>Call
It Sleep</I> concerning the political ambiguity of certain cultural or
class identifications in the 1930s, we encounter the limits of what may be
called a political formalism, in which the social or political import of
certain commitments is understood to have been established at the level of
theory, and is thus independent of any of the particular social fields in
which those commitments might operate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In the absence, for
example, of recovering the specific fields of identification in which
<I>Call It Sleep</I> elaborates its commitment to a kind of high modern
alienation, Roth's novel would be, and indeed has been understood as
profoundly conservative on the grounds that the politically reactionary
nature of disidentification has been conceptually established. And yet to
recover the specific understandings of the Jew and the worker that Roth's
narrative resists is to find--or so I hope to have shown--that its
commitment to refusing such identifications cannot be so easily
understood. Indeed Roth's novel, and the recovery of its original context,
provides a provocative argument for the desirability of revisiting the
grounds upon which a number of political judgments have been made about a
number of literary works and periods.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 And finally, with
respect to the question of what kinds of cultural work have a right to be
called progressive, <I>Call It Sleep,</I> and, hopefully, the analysis
conducted here suggests that the best answers we can give to those
questions will be discovered at the level of what we might call sociality
as distinct from theory.

Ibid., 215. Since Telling and Morton's text weighs so heavily in
myargument for a shift in American discourse from race to psychology, and
from culture to economics, I want to be explicit about the degree to which
it is representative. My central claim for its representativeness rests on
a particular difference between a novel like <I>Bread Givers</I> and a
novel like <I>Jews Without Money</I> with respect to the narrative of
becoming (or failing to become) an American. The difference is between a
narrative in which ancestry is central to the question of Americanization,
and a narrative in which resilience is central to that question. Moreover,
Morton's book is part of a genealogy of contemporaneous studies that
entertain, with varying degrees of explicitness, the hypothesis that the
future of the nation has more to do with psychology than race, given that
its concerns would soon be more economic than cultural. For instance, in
their preface to H. von Hug-Hellmuth's <I>A Study of the Mental Life of
the Child,</I> trans. James J. Putnam (Washington: Nervous and Mental
Disease Publishing Company, 1919), James J. Putnam and Mabel Stevens argue
that since adulthood is nothing but "an extension of childhood," the key
to an individual's future lay in his or her "mental life" rather than in
his or her ancestry or genetic makeup (viii). By 1925, Morton and Telling
are in a position to shape this premise into the more specific argument
that, since nations depend upon the adults that run them, and since the
psychological traits of adaptability and resilience may be increasingly
demanded of adults, the key to the national future might lie in
cultivating these particular traits in children. And by 1930 this line of
argument is sufficiently established to allow Willard C. Olson, in
<I>Problem Tendencies in Children</I> (Minneapolis: University of
Minnesota Press, 1930), to state quite simply that an indifference to
"environmental demands" constitutes a "behavior problem" ; and to allow
Samuel Hartwell, in <I>Fifty-Five Bad Boys</I> (New York: Knopf, 1931), to
explain that the term "bad boy" signifies "a maladjusted boy," and that
now there was no more important task than intervening in the lives of such
bad boys in order to "modify the behavior and emotional habit patterns of
children in the direction of normal and healthy reactions" .

<a NAME="FOOT20" HREF="#REF20">20</a>.
One point raised by the description of <I>Call It Sleep</I> advancedhere
bears remarking upon. Roth's joining the Communist Party of the
United States in 1933 might indicate an embrace of precisely the class
identification that I am claiming the novel resists. Roth's membership,
however, is profitably contrasted to Gold's. Like most party members, Gold
appears to have joined the CPUSA because he was committed to reorganizing
America in the interests of workers, and because he understood the party
to be the best means to that end. In the wake of problematic events like
the Moscow Trials and the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Gold was capable of critiquing
the party, and at times of distancing himself from it when it disengaged
from the interests to which he was committed. For a concise account of
Gold's dealings with the CPUSA, see Michael Folsom, introduction to
<I>Mike Gold: A Literary Anthology,</I> ed. Michael Folsom (New York:
International, 1972), 7-20. Roth, by contrast, appears to have turned
to the party out of a disaffection more general than the economic
disaffection that animated Gold. The very events that would qualify the
loyalty of party members like Gold left Roth unruffled; when pressed, Roth
would explain his allegiance by insisting that it was finally "the product
more of intuition than analysis" (Henry Roth, "Where My Sympathy Lies,"
<I>The New Masses,</I> 2 March 1937, 9). The nature of the "intuition" in
question can be recovered by recalling the most immediate thing the CPUSA
could be said to have represented at the time Roth joined: a fundamental
opposition to everything that America had historically been to that point.
To recall this fact is to recognize the degree to which Roth's turn to the
party was animated less by his commitment to the interests of a particular
<I>class</I> than by his commitment to rejecting--in the most fundamental
way possible--the nation he inhabited. We can then begin to understand not
only the peculiar logic behind Roth's vexing history with the CPUSA, but
the logic by which he comes to understand modernist alienation as an
<I>extension</I> of political opposition.

For a concise introduction to the kind of debates referred to here,and
for an indication of the degree to which they tend to revolve around
"postmodern" judgments or evaluations of "modernism," see Charles Altieri,

Literary History</I> 2 (fall 1990): 443-81.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT22" HREF="#REF22">22</a>.
This line of argument originated in early, and often marxist, analysesof
the high-modern insistence that art occupied a sphere of its own,
analyses that saw this insistence as deceptive and indicative of a desire
to avoid potentially destabilizing debates about the social and political
structure of the world. For a more general critique, see Stanley Fish,
"Unger and Milton," in his <I>Doing What Comes Naturally: Change,
Rhetoric, and the Practice of Theory in Literary and Legal Studies</I>
(Durham, N. C.: Duke University Press, 1989), 399-435; and Martin

<a NAME="FOOT23" HREF="#REF23">23</a>.
Again, we see this in early marxist analyses of modern alienation,which
see that posture as a sign of unhappiness without which the urgency
of conceptualizing alternative worlds might vanish. More recently, Roberto
Unger has made the resistance to identification that this position
celebrates the basis of a postfoundational politics that he calls
Superliberalism. Superliberalism is defined by its commitment to the
heightened artificiality, plasticity, or disposability of all social
arrangements, or, as Unger writes, by its commitment to the pervasive
"availability to challenge" of structure as such (Roberto Mangabeira
Unger, <I>False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian Social Theory in the Service
of Radical Democracy,</I> vol. 1 of <I>Politics: A Work in Constructive
Social Theory</I> [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987], 362).
Richard Rorty has been one of Unger's most enthusiastic supporters, and
Judith Butler has recently elaborated the kind of resistance in question
here in a provocative analysis of the work of Drucilla Cornell and Ernesto
Laclau. See Roberto Unger, <I>Politics: A Work in Constructive Social
Theory,</I> 3 vols.; Richard Rorty, "Unger, Castoriadis, and the Romance

The kind of work I have in mind tends to identify itself aspostmodern,
and to proceed under the assumption that current philosophical
and intellectual work has conclusively established the politically
reactionary nature of commitments to unity, identity, and consensus, and
the politically progressive nature of commitments to difference,
plurality, and marginality. As Terry Eagleton has recently observed, this
stance, while increasingly accepted as a matter of course, is less
philosophically sound than it appears: "Nobody on the left," Eagleton
writes, "wants to see a plurality of fascist parties, praises a social
group . . . just because of its marginality, or mistakes the solidarity of
the ANC for some tyrannical totality." As Eagleton goes on to suggest, the
formalism of this style of thought testifies not so much to successful
theorizing as to unsuccessful practice, or, as he puts it, the formalism
of this style of thought is "a symptom of the left's current bafflement,
not a solution to it." (Terry Eagleton, "Discourse and Discos: Theory in
the Space Between Culture and Capitalism," <I>The New York Times Literary
Supplement,</I> 15 July 1994, 3-4)

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT26" HREF="#REF26">26</a>.
For instance, it has long been argued that the desire forcohesion or
community evident in the work of a re like Eliot is
reactionary, since that desire involves valorizing sameness over
difference, and since that valorization involves compromising an autonomy
or "otherness" that difference respects. Yet the same valorization of
sameness over difference also informs the work of a re like Langston
Hughes (think of his poem "The Negro Speaks of Rivers"), committed as it
often is to the formation of a racial community from distinct individuals.
To point out the similarities between the formal commitment that Eliot and
Hughes share is not necessarily to revise our sense of the political
judgments we make about their work, but it does indicate the degree to
which the judgments we make will depend upon recognizing the specific
natures of the projects to which the two res were committed, and upon
recovering the <I>specific fields of operation</I> within which those
commitments assumed or failed to assume their force.

<P>
On these grounds we may wish to retain our sense that the sameness to
which Eliot was committed was conservative, even reactionary, while the
sameness to which Hughes was committed was progressive. But what of the
resistance to the requirement of racial sameness evident at times in the
work of res like Countee Cullen and Jean Toomer? Is that resistance
reactionary simply because Hughes's commitment to sameness appears
progressive in contrast to Eliot's? And what of the possibility that
Eliot's commitment to community derived its force from a resistance to the
kind of nationalism understood to have precipitated World War I? Is
Eliot's commitment reactionary even if it emerged as a critique of
European nationalism? To ask these questions is to point to the limits of
approaching them formally, while also indicating the necessity of
returning to the work in question in order to examine the grounds upon
which political judgments about it have been made. It is to take seriously
an insistence most recently associated with the work of Pierre Bourdieu:
an adequate analysis of any discourse and its force must be based on a
systematic reconstruction of the field within which such discourse is
produced and received, with its distinctive forms of organization,
production, perception, and so on. For an analysis of the modern period
that is attentive to this insistence, see Edward Said on Yeats in his
<I>Culture and Imperialism</I> (New York: Knopf, 1993); for an analysis of
an earlier period, see Frances Ferguson's inquiry into transcendental
thought in <I>Solitude and the Sublime: Romanticism and the Aesthetics of
Individuation</I> (New York: Routledge, 1992).

In October 1926, critic C. H. Rickword observed that "character is, to
borrow biological jargon, an emergent quality of
the novel. It emerges from the story, which is itself structurally a
product of language. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 In a
review of Elizabeth Drew's study, <I>The Modern Novel,</I> Rickword called
character an "organizing principle" ("NF,"
156), and defined "the quality that is common to all great works of
literature, in no matter what genre" ("NF," 157):
"it is primarily a sequence of events developing in accordance with an
inner necessity" ("NF," 157). In its interest in
a sequence of developmental events, the notion of an inner necessity, the
concept of an organizing principle, and its
opposition between an "emergent quality" and the structural surround from
which it emerges, as in its overt admission
that it is borrowing from biology, this manifesto from the realm of
literature challenges the two-culture divide.
Rickword is writing about literature using terms current in modern
embryology.

<P>
I want to explore the possibility that developments in the scientific
field of embryology--concerned as it is with the
principle of individual development against a backdrop of species change
over time--have a relationship to developments
within the art of fiction, with the latter's emphasis on character
creation against a backdrop of narrative and
language, in the modern period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In short, I will ask: What
connections may exist between the embryological
"take" on the developing individual, and the literary approach to
character construction in the first three decades of
the twentieth century?

<P>
Since its origins in the observations of Hippocrates and Aristotle,
embryology focused on "the most obstinate
biological problem of all--that of how the egg develops into a complex



<B></B>


organism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 While in the
nineteenth century it was primarily a descriptive science, concerned with
morphology, with form, by the dawn of the
twentieth century, embryology had emerged as an experimental science as
embryologists engaged in a heated series of
debates.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Vitalists, favoring the notion of a life-force
fueling development, were vanquished by mechanists,
who held that embryonic development could be explained "on a mechanical
cause-and-effect basis" (<I>SL,</I>
263).
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Preformationists, who held that the entire adult
organism existed preformed in the egg, were
decisively overruled by epigenesists, who held that the organism developed
through successive processes of
differentiation, from a previously undifferentiated entity (<I>SL,</I>
31). These movements in modern embryology had
their parallels in modern culture at large, in its increasing
mechanization, breakdown of communal certainties, and
threat to conventional ideas of causality and predictability.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

So just as the seventeenth century saw the
development of a "fetal subject" suiting the new requirements of the
liberal civil state, early-twentieth-century
embryology charted the development of a new embryo suited to its
period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This was an embryo neither
preformed nor infused with an ineffable life force, but instead
machine-like and developing into a greater
differentiation subject to the reign of chance.

<P>
Three new experimental techniques developed in the first two decades of
the twentieth century enabled embryologists to
investigate the nature of the relationship between individual and species
(phenotype and genotype) or, to put it more
broadly, between the problems of embryonic development and hereditary
transmission of differences. They were tissue
culture, grafting, and artificial parthenogenesis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 These
techniques are particularly interesting, because
they address issues in embryology that echo specific problems of character
creation in modern literature: the temporal
and spatial boundaries of the individual, the malleability of sex/gender,
and the organizing principles of development.

<P>
The technique of tissue culture, perfected in 1907, enabled embryologists
to excise living tissue and keep it alive,
bathed in a nutrient solution, in petri dishes or test tubes. American
scientist Ross Harrison first carried out this
technique successfully in his anatomy lab at The Johns Hopkins University,
when he induced fragments of nervous tissue
from frog embryos to stay alive, and to produce outgrowths, when cultured
outside the body. The same technique was
later practiced with great cultural prominence by Alexis Carrel, who
brought it to London--and mass cultural
celebrity--in 1924.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The technique of grafting was perfected by
Hans Spemann in 1918, when, in what H. G.
Wells, Julian Huxley, and G. P. Wells, in <I>The Science of Life</I>
, dubbed "a series of beautiful experiments
with developing newts' eggs,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 he "cut out one part of an
embryo and implanted it in another position to
see what would become of it" (<I>SL,</I> 259). When "Spemann transposed
presumptive brain with presumptive belly, and
found that each became the kind of tissue which was required by its new
environment," he began the process that led to
the discovery of the principle that organized embryonic growth (<I>SL,</I>
259).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P>
Given their prominence in the scientific and cultural imaginary, it is
hardly surprising that both tissue culture and
grafting appeared in literary texts as metaphoric


<B></B>


strategies for
character creation. As Lucia Sander has shown,
Susan Glaspell's 1922 play, "The Verge," used a woman scientist's
botanical experiment in the creation of hybrid plants
to embody the parallel experiment in living being carried out by the
heroine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Like her prized hybrid "Edge
Vine," Clare's liminal challenge to conventional gender roles (motherhood,
wifehood) is aesthetically, philosophically,
and socially risky. Clare's husband finds her work disturbing: "changing
things into other things--putting things
together and making queer new things . . . it's unsettling for a
woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Clare's description of her plants
holds for herself as well: "These plants . . . perhaps they are less
beautiful--less sound--than the plants from which
they diverged. But they have found--otherness. . . . They have been
shocked out of what they were--into something they
were not; they've broken from the forms in which they found themselves.
They are alien. Outside." (<I>V,</I> 52)
Glaspell explicitly invokes the innovations of contemporary embryology
when Clare, speaking implicitly of botany
<I>and</I> society, imagines a world in which disparate parts are broken
and recombined with disturbing and exciting
implications: "I want to break it up! I tell you, I want to break it up!
If it were all in pieces, we'd be . . .
shocked to aliveness-- . . . wouldn't we? There would be strange new
comings together--mad new comings together, and we
would know what it is to be born, and then we might know--that we are.
Smash it. <I>[Her hand is near an egg.]</I> As
you'd smash an egg." (<I>V,</I> 19) We can trace a network of
embryological references, from Glaspell's play to Aldous
Huxley's <I>Antic Hay</I> a year later , where Shearwater's
horrifying laboratory creations literalize the
embryological experiments in grafting and tissue culture of the era, in
order to offer ironic commentary on the sexual
and social experimentation of the early 1920s. There is the "Cock into
which Shearwater had engrafted an ovary," and
who now knows not "whether to crow or cluck," and the "beetles, who had
had their heads cut off and replaced by the
heads of other beetles," and who "darted uncertainly about, some obeying
their heads, some their genital
organs."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Then, three years later, in 1926, zoologist Julian
Huxley published a short story in the <I>Yale
Review</I> that explored the cross-cultural, cross-species implications of
those embryological techniques. "The
Tissue-Culture King," subtitled "A Parable of Modern Science," is a
fanciful adventure story in which the members of an
African tribe are taught by a British medical researcher to culture the
king's tissues and so extend his power--and
their own.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 As I have discussed elsewhere, this short story
used one of the most celebrated modern
embryological techniques to launch a critique of the eugenic control
fantasies of modern science. But more importantly
for our purposes now, it also drew on embryology to consider the political
and psychological implications of thinking
of identity not as stabilized in space and in one time period, but rather
as diffused and disseminated across different
spaces and times. Finally, in 1932, Aldous Huxley's <I>Brave New World</I>
considered how the techniques of tissue
culturing could challenge the nature of biological <I>and</I> cultural
individuality, with the image of the conformist
human products of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Center.

<P>
While tissue culture and grafting made it possible for embryologists to
investigate the temporal and spatial boundaries
of the organism, another technique enabled


<B></B>


embryologists to study the
relative contribution of the two sexes to
the new individual. Artificial parthenogenesis, "one of the most striking
discoveries of modern biology," according to
Wells, Huxley, and Wells, was first developed by Jacques Loeb in
1901.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 This technique consists of the
mechanical or chemical stimulation of ova, producing cell division
characteristic of fertilization, without stimulus by
sperm. While parthenogenesis occurs naturally in a number of organisms,
Loeb initiated this as a laboratory procedure
when he exposed sea-urchin eggs to salt water, inducing them to develop
first to the larval stage and then to
adulthood.

<P>
In an era that also saw the suffrage movement, eugenics, and sexology,
artificial parthenogenesis was a particularly
rich site for traffic between literature and science, because it explored
the proper conditions for fertilization and
development, and the relative contributions of paternal and maternal
progenitors to the construction and development of
the individual. H. G. Wells uses a contrast between artificial
parthenogenesis and normal two-sex reproduction to
delineate character in his novel <I>Ann Veronica</I> . Studying
embryology and physiology in the laboratory of
the Central Imperial College in London, his protagonist meditates on the
fact that

Just as Wells describes the London in which Ann Veronica comes to maturity
as "that remarkable laboratory of
relationships" (<I>AV,</I> 151), so too Virginia Woolf borrows from
science, in the manuscript drafts of <I>A Room of
One's Own.</I> Yet while Wells uses science to enforce conventional sex
roles, Woolf draws on it to escape them,
defining the conditions that will favor the emergence of the modern woman
writer:

<P>
 Nine years before the publication of <I>A Room of One's Own,</I> Aldous
Huxley published his first short story, "The
Farcical History of Richard Greenow" . Woolf was familiar with
Huxley's story when she drafted <I>A Room of One's
Own,</I> having reviewed his <I>Limbo,</I> the volume in which it first
appeared, for the <I>Times Literary
Supplement</I> in 1920. There are a number of parallels between Huxley's
farcical work and Woolf's serious essay that
suggest Huxley's story is an important source for <I>A Room of One's
Own.</I> I was first struck by the similarity
between these two works when I noticed that both featured curious
conversational vignettes about a classic example of
anomalous development: a Manx cat. In Huxley's story, the protagonist must
endure embarrassing questions posed him by
his headmaster's wife:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"And so you have a deep, passionate fondness for cats," [she said] as
though they had been intimately discussing the
subject for the last hour. Dick had enough presence of mind to say that,
yes, he did like cats--all except those Manx
ones that had no tails.
<BR>

"No tails," Mrs. Cravister repeated--"no tails. Like men. How
symbolical everything is!"

<P>
Woolf too includes a conversation about the Manx cat in <I>A Room of One's
Own,</I> but the detail that in Huxley
served to differentiate human beings from animals serves in Woolf to
differentiate men from women: "It is strange what
a difference a tail makes. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The previously unstudied
relationship between these two works merits a
longer investigation than I can give here, but what interests me now is
the fact that both works are cultural and
literary explorations of issues also being investigated by embryologists
of that era: the "conditions of emergence" for
a modern writer and the relative importance of maternal and paternal, or
female and male, influences on the writer's
mind and art. Both stories make metaphoric use of a notion of single-sex
generation that recalls the technique of
artificial parthenogenesis. But the two stories borrow, and use, this
concept drawn from early-twentieth-century
embryology quite differently.

<P>
"The Farcical History of Richard Greenow" concerns a man who finds that he
has--parthenogenetically, if you
will--germinated a new being inside himself: a woman writer of sentimental
fiction named Pearl Bellairs. As Greenow
discovers,

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He was a hermaphrodite. A hermaphrodite, not in the gross obvious sense of
course, but spiritually. Two persons in one,
male and female. . . . He was not in the least distressed to discover this
abnormality in his character. As long as the
two parts of him kept well apart, as long as his male self could
understand mathematics, and as long as his lady
novelist's self kept up her regular habit of writing at night and retiring
from business during the day, the
arrangement would be admirable. ["FH," 433]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>



<B></B>


While Greenow forges a brilliant career in political journalism, his
"lady novelist's self," Pearl Bellairs,
continues her nightly output of five thousand words, publishing a series
of popular novels that generates a lavish
income for him. With the outbreak of the war, relations between the two
selves become more difficult: Dick is a
pacifist, and discovers to his horror that Pearl Greenow has begun writing
articles of "shrilly raucous chauvinism"
("FH," 445). Worse still, when the war ends, and the franchise is extended
to women over thirty, Pearl Bellairs shows
up in the Town Hall--in <I>his</I> body--demanding her woman's vote.
Greenow is committed to an insane asylum, where he
dies, inhabited to the last by Pearl Bellairs, leaving behind a scribbled
sheaf of conflicted ravings and directives
dictated by both of his selves.

<P>
Huxley gives us a tale of parthenogenetic male "psychic birth" leading to
debilitating, involuntary psychic androgyny,
while Woolf's <I>A Room of One's Own</I> gives us a case of aesthetic
androgyny that is not debilitating, but enabling.
Greenow's farcical dilemma of being inhabited by a writer of another sex
is, in Woolf's essay, literalized as a serious
aesthetic principle rather than a psychic (and aesthetic) debility, an
argument for psychic androgyny or bisexuality,
rather than for masculine resistance to feminine impulses:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
in each of us two powers preside, one male, one female. . . . The normal
and comfortable state of being is that when
the two live in harmony together, spiritually cooperating. If one is a
man, still the woman part of the brain must have
effect; and a woman also must have intercourse with the man in her.
Coleridge perhaps meant this when he said that a
great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes place that the
mind is fully fertilised and uses all its
faculties. Perhaps a mind that is purely masculine cannot create, any more
than a mind that is purely feminine. . . .
[<I>R,</I> 102]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
While in "Greenow" the war calls forth the jingoistic female effusions of
Pearl Bellairs, in <I>A Room of One's Own</I>
it elicits a purely male creation--a hideous parody of artificial
parthenogenesis, whose progeny is produced in the
absence not of the male, but of the female progenitor:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

There has been a meeting of academicians whose object it is "to develop
the Italian novel." "Men famous by birth, or in
finance, industry, or the Fascist corporations" came together the other
day and discussed the matter, and a telegram
was sent to the Duce expressing the hope "that the Fascist era would soon
give birth to a poet worthy of it." We may
all join in that pious hope, but it is doubtful whether poetry can come
out of an incubator. Poetry ought to have a
mother as well as a father. The Fascist poem, one may fear, will be a
horrid little abortion such as one sees in a
glass jar in the museum of some country town. Such monsters never live
long, it is said: one has never seen a prodigy
of that sort cropping grass in a field. Two heads on one body do not make
for length of life. [<I>R,</I> 107]

<P>
Woolf briefly toys with the notion of a mental parthenogenesis in her
image of women writers learning from a
rediscovered female tradition: "we think back through our mothers, if we
are women" (<I>R,</I> 79). One of the critical
problems posed


<B></B>


by <I>A Room of One's Own</I> has been to reconcile
this argument for reclaiming a female
literary lineage with Woolf's final model of the androgynous artist. Woolf
recoils from the notion--shared with, and
possibly even drawn from, Huxley--of a parthenogenetic, male-male or
female-female, lineage, imaged in the writer who
comes into being without being "fertilized" by a partner of the opposite
sex (whether it is Pearl Bellairs or the
Fascist poet of <I>A Room of One's Own</I>). This is the main subject of
critique both in Huxley's farce and Woolf's
serious essay. The solutions to these dangerously narrow models for
literary creativity are dramatically different,
however. Huxley suggests that Greenow would have been better off if Pearl
Bellairs had never inhabited him, while Woolf
calls not for less gender blending, but more.

<P>
In their adaptations of embryological techniques to questions of character
construction--among them the temporal and
spatial boundaries of the individual, the malleability of sex/gender, and
the organizing principles of
development--these modern literary texts demonstrate the range of cultural
meanings both borrowed from, and enabled by,
the discourse of early-twentieth-century embryology. The interest that
modern writers demonstrated in these new
techniques in the years between 1900 and 1935 has been echoed, since 1980,
by a parallel explosion of global interest
in embryology, embodied in a number of fictions exploring fetal life, from
Salman Rushdie's <I>Midnight's Children,</I>
Ariel Dorfman's <I>The Last Song of Manuel Sendero,</I> and Carlos
Fuentes's <I>Christopher Unborn</I> to Kenzaburo
Oe's <I>A Personal Matter</I> and Pascal Bruckner's <I>The Divine
Child,</I> each of which can be understood as drawing
on embryological models to articulate a new, national fetal
subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In the intervening years (1940 to
1980), as Evelyn Fox Keller has recently shown, embryology was nearly
eclipsed by the new disciplinary prestige of
genetics and molecular biology. It has taken two decades to refocus from
the "discourse of gene action" (as Keller
styles it) to a study of "higher organisms," and the embryology to which
we have returned is not the same as the
discipline abandoned in the rush of enthusiasm for genetics and molecular
biology in the late 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The
cultural and aesthetic implications of this changed scientific
construction of the individual remain to be understood,
and to shape our reading of the embryological borrowings of contemporary
fictions.

It is quite often said, by those who try to outline the methods by which
science operates, that a first phase in its
development consists of the observation of data, a second, of their
classification, and that there finally follows an
inquiry into their relationships. If there is any single generalization
that can be safely formulated concerning the
history of embryology as a whole, it is probably that this science has
carried out all these procedures simultaneously
at all phases of its development, from the time of Aristotle through to
our own. [Jane M. Oppenheimer, "Present

<P>
I want to present to my compatriots, the words that Marechal Petain has
spoken directly to the French people, Marechal Petain who in the last
war saved France by a great victory, and in this war has saved them
throughout their great defeat.

<P>
I am well aware that until just now it would have been 
quite impossible
to interest my fellow countrymen, in these words which tell so convincing
and so moving a story.

<P>
We in the United States until just now have been apoiled [spoiled]
children. S ince the civil war until to-day, when the action of Japan
has made us realise the misery the grief and the terror of war, all this
time because we have tender h hearts we have always felt for others and
helped them all we could<S>m</S> but we did not understand defeat enough to
sympathise with the French people and with their Marechal Petain, who
like George  ashington, and he is very like George Washington because
he too is first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his
countrymen, who like George Washington has given them courage in their
darkest moment held them together through their times of desperation
and has always told them the truth and in telling them the truth has
made them realise that the truth would set them free.

<P>
We have not all of us, and I too have been of that number, over here in
France always had faith in the Marechal but in the end we have all come
to have faith, and now I will tell a little more what he has done and
how he has done it and why I want everybody in America to realise it.


<B></B>

<P>
In the last war we waited day after day and day after day and Verdun
did not fall, that was when we first knew about Petain, and Verdun
did not fall. Then for a long time there was nothing about him, and
then he was sent to spain as ambassador after the Spanish civil war,
and then everybody remembered about him and everybody said that it
was interesting. Then there was this war and week by week, things were
getting more and more terrible, and then they said Petain was to be at
the head of the army and we felt a little hope. To be sure there was the
old prediction that when the enemy had gotten to Lyons the country that
is France would be saved by an old man on a white horse and Petain had
always ridden a white horse, his name was Monastir, and as a matter of
fact he did make the armistice in front of Lyon.

<P>
And now he had to defend his armistice as he had defended Verdun, and
he d id.

<P>
In the days immediately following the armistice when the Germans had
left the zone libre, and in the other zone the French were accepting
their life a s <S>it</S> it was everybody began to talk again and the thing
they talked about most at first was the age of the Marechal. He had
become not Petain not Marechal Petain but the Marechal.

<P>
Everybody worried about his age was he too old to last out end [and was]
he too old to go on saving them, he undoubtedly had saved them, was he
too old to resist what there would be to resist. In short was he too old.

<P>
He was old but gradually it was decided that he was not too old. Being
as old as he was and not having a family, he won the difficult faith
of the French people they realised that being as old as he was and not
having a family, he had no future, he only had the future of France,
and as French people mustrust [mistrust] people who have a future they
could put their trust in the Marechal because he being as old<S>d</S>as he was
and without a family had only France's future and so they did pretty
well all of them did trust him. Logevity is always respected in France
and this longevity of the Marechal was a very special thing and so they
did trust him and when he told them anything he told them the truth and
very often he did not tell them anything.

<P>
Then came the time when the French people gradually came to feel what
they did feel, what they always do feel that they do not at all think
alike all of them about anything. As a Frenchman explained it to me
it is not only that they do not think alike with their neighbors but
they do not think alike within themselves. As he said, you take any one
French one, that one French one has quite logically perhspas [perhaps]
four points of view. Supposing he has a son a prisoner, well he wants
the war over as quickly as possible so that his son will come home, so
he wants the Germans to win as that would finish the quickest, at the
same time he is a business man and he wants business to go on, and that
would only happen if the Germans were defeated and England won, then
he wants the Marechal and as the English are opposed to him they would
insist on bringing back into France all the people who helped to ruin
France so they do not want England to win and then there is Russia, and
that is ever more complicating. You see said this Frenchman no Frenchman
can feel simply about this thing.


<B></B>

<P>
And then gradually the Marechal either did what any one and every one
thought he ought to do or he did not, and whether he did or whether
he did not and really nobody really knew there was one thing that was
certain and that was that <S>like Benjamin Franklin</S> he never defecnded
[defended] himself, he never explained himself, in short his character
did not need any defence.

<P>
And so there came this considerable period where everybody had feelings
about the Marechal, about one thing they were all agreed and that is that
he had achieved a miracle, without arms without any means of defense,
he had succeeded in making the Germans more or less keep their word with
him. Gradually this miracle impressed itself upon every one.

<P>
Always there were rumors and more rumors and sometimes everybody believed
them. that the Marechal had yielded this or he had yileded [yielded] that
to the Germans, and gradually in spite of all the feeling of bitterness
that was aroused everybody in their hearts knew that it was not true,
knew that he had not. Nice stories began to be told. The Germans wanted
to take something in the zone libre which they had no right to take, the
percentage of material. The Marechal said, I do not wish it. The Germans
and the people around the Marechal said what can you do about it. I can
do nothing about it said the Marechal but I do not wish it. And it ended
in their not doing it.

<P>
We used to all stand on the country-roads and discuss, this time
the Marechal has given in, and we almost were sure that he had given
in. Gradually they began to tell that when he was asked who was going
to win the Engliah [English] or the Germans, he did not answer and when
he was pressed he touched his breast and answered Moi I. <S>Moi.</S>

<P>
I cannot tell you how many times in this long difficult year we thought
many of us thought that he had gone under, under one thing or under
another, and we all talked and talked but no, the Miracle which is a
miracle, and his defense of his armistice has been a miracle went on
being a miracle, and here it still is.

<P>
A nice story was told me the other day about him which has nothing to do
with this but which is a story that I like. He was at that time a colonel
it was before the last war and he belonged to a military club. All the
young officers were talking about the possible coming war and they were
excited and xxxxxxx laughing and shouting, and slowly there was a silence
and Colonel Petain said and do you think war is always funny, toujouts

And so we in France having seen France governed, having seen everybody
pretty well fed having seen everybody slowly regain their health
and strength, felt every one gradually recovering their liberty and
their activity, and having seen every time that all being lost actually
everything was being held together, I must say little by little the most
critical and the most violent of us have come gradually to do what the
Marechal asks all French people to do, to have faith in him and in the
fact that France will live. And this is to introduce the actual words
said by the Marechal when it was necessary for him to say something and
it is a convincing and moving story.

<p>
<I>Gertrude Stein's "Introduction to the Speeches of Mar&eacute;chal
P&eacute;tain" was drawn out of the Random House papers held at Columbia
University by Wanda Van Dusen, a former Ph.D. candidate at the University
of California, San Diego. I say "former" since in the fall of 1995 Wanda
took her own life and thus ended what looked to be a promising academic
career. The reasons for Wanda's suicide probably will never be known, and
this is not the occasion to speculate on them. Rather, it is time to
present --and celebrate-- the work of a remarkable scholar, someone highly
regarded within the Literature Department at UCSD and a friend to her
fellow students and professors. As someone who worked closely with her in
seminars and then as her dissertation director I respected her
intelligence, resourcefulness, and humor. Her death has stunned and
saddened us all.</I>

<P>
<I>Wanda was well on her way to completing her dissertation at the time of
her death. Her project involved the gender of modernism as seen through
the optic of three authors: Irmgard Keun, Michel Leiris, and Gertrude
Stein. The exceptional qualities of this dissertation can be seen in the
essay that follows, which would have formed part of a dissertation
chapter. Wanda's work on Stein is particularly important since it deals
with the thorny issue of the author's relationship to the German
occupation of France as well as her attitudes toward race, national
identity, and anti-Semitism. Wanda's use of unpublished manuscript
materials as well as her use of current critical models ( feminism,
psychoanalysis, film theory) creates a </I>


<B></B>


<I>cultural context for
reading Stein that integrates the best of historical criticism and
contemporary theory.</I>

<P>
<I>I am grateful to the Gertrude Stein Estate and its executor, Calman
Levin, for permission to publish Stein's "Introduction." I would also like
to thank Random House for its cooperation.</I>

<P>
At the top of a previously unpublished manuscript by Gertrude Stein, held
in Columbia University's Random House collection, Stein's editor, Bennett
Cerf, handwrote the following comment: "For the records. This disgusting
piece was mailed from Belley on Jan. 19, 1942." The four-page,
double-spaced, typed manuscript is listed in the collection under the
title, "Introduction to the Speeches of Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain."
Between 17 June 1940, Philippe Henri P&eacute;tain's first address as
chief of state, and 19 January 1942, when Stein sent her "Introduction" to
Cerf, the Mar&eacute;chal delivered approximately sixty speeches, most of
which were broadcast to the French public by radio.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Stein's
piece raises both ethical and theoretical questions, the first of which is
how much she may have collaborated with the Vichy regime to protect her
and Alice Toklas's lives as Jewish American lesbians in the French
countryside at Bilignin par Belley. In other words, to what extent could
her narrative portrait of Philippe P&eacute;tain as the essence of French
national heroism have prevented their deportation? The second question is
the degree to which the essentialization
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 of subjectivity in
the "Introduction" calls into question deconstructive tendencies in her
earlier experimental writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
The "Introduction to the Speeches of Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain"
rekindles the debate over the depth of conviction behind Stein's
"anti-patriarchal" experimental writing between 1906 and 1932
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

in light of evidence of her political conservatism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 On the one
hand, Stein is defended by critics like Marianne DeKoven, Maria Diedrich,
and Lisa Ruddick as subversively deconstructive, feminist, and
pacifist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, she is portrayed by some like
Blanche Wiesen Cook as a Jewish anti-Semite, misogynist lesbian, and
bourgeois antisocialist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The question is perhaps better
formulated as to what degree and at what times Stein fits any or all of
these descriptions, and how they relate to her theory of human
subjectivity as a combination of stable, interior "bottom nature" and
shifting, exterior manifestations of what she terms mere
"emphasis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P>
In her "Introduction," Stein eclipses her Jewishness by presenting herself
as an unmarked American, citizen of a country that has not yet declared
war against Germany. In this way, she displaces one modernist essence,
ethnicity, with another, nationality. Her narrative portrait of
P&eacute;tain as the heroic father of France, the fetishized embodiment of
the French nation, disguises not only the racist, nondemocratic



<B></B>


character of the Vichy government but also Stein's vulnerability as a
racially marked foreign resident. At that level, her retelling of the
Mar&eacute;chal's "moving"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 story may be read as the "making"
of a fetish that could "save" her and Toklas from the anti-Semitic
practices of his regime. In <I>Paris France</I> , Stein's critique
of Hitler's Germany as the "dead" country that has killed its music and
musicians "these last two years" indicates that Stein may have been aware
of the dangers presented by Vichy's collaboration with
Berlin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In this context, the "Introduction" can be seen as
performing a redemptive fetishistic ritual that denies the existence of
racism in the so-called free zone <I>(zone libre)</I> administered by
P&eacute;tain.

<P>
Stein's conviction that an inner essence can be read at the surface of
subjectivity establishes the theoretical basis for a fetishistic
representation of Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain as France's heroic
national savior. There are two dimensions to the fetishistic production of
this trope in the context of Vichy's cult of the nation. First, a
political leader is invested with the supernatural power of a religious
re, a characteristic trope of Western secularization since the
Renaissance. P&eacute;tain's armistice "without any means of defense" (l.
76) and his success "in making the Germans more or less keep their word
with him" (ll. 76-77) are represented as demonstrations of miraculous
power. Second, as the one whose character was so perfect that "he never
explained himself" (ll. 72-73), P&eacute;tain is a symbol of the
nation highly invested with narcissistic libido and serves like the fetish
as a "<I>stabilizer</I> of libido."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Replacing Jeanne d'Arc as
both the symbol of patriotism and the Republic,
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Stein's
conration of the Mar&eacute;chal functions as the mirror image of
masculine France, its ego ideal.

<B>The Making of a National Fetish</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Stein's fascination with "making," as in <I>The Making of Americans</I>
and the fabrication of portraits, expresses itself as fetishistic
image-making in her "Introduction." In general, fetishes function to grant
human agency to inanimate objects. As such, they deny individual or
societal vulnerability associated with the lack of power. In Freudian
psychoanalysis, the fetish as a manifestation of male castration fears
serves to mask the absence of a female penis. In Lacanian theory, the
fetish denies the absence of the phallus of the mother, understood as the
signifier of symbiotic need for fulfillment, pleasure, and security.
Fetishism involves the cultural production of objects invested with
supernatural power, and in the West, Christianity presents man as "made"
in the image of God while its binary opposite, the <I>maleficium</I> of
magic, is seen as the devil's "bad making."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Stein's
representation of the Mar&eacute;chal as prophesied defender of the nation
fetishistically denies the humiliation of political and military defeat by
reinscribing the armistice as an act of salvation. His promotion as an
inevitable sign of France's destiny is part of an appeal to American
nationalism; nationalism, after all, "thinks in terms of historical
destinies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Through a series of adverbial repetitions, Stein
creates a sense of the inevitable: "always," "gradually," "then," "day
after day," "little by little," "more and more." The term used by
P&eacute;tain


<B></B>


on 20 June 1940 to justify his arrangement with Germany
to the French is "inescapable" (<I>"in&eacute;luctable"</I> [<I>D,</I>
59]). The portrait of the Mar&eacute;chal as national fetish and the
narrative of his "moving" story are constructed through a series of
comparisons that connect past and present, France and America:
Verdun/Pearl Harbor, P&eacute;tain/George Washington (and Benjamin
Franklin). The comparisons are reinforced by a discourse of binary
oppositions that maintains a tension between visions of threat to and
salvation of the French nation: victory/defeat, faith/doubt, truth/rumors,
save/ruin, everybody/no one, etc. Discursively, the comparisons are
designed to incite identification with one national group by another, that
is, the Americans with the French.

<P>
In reinscribing P&eacute;tain's collaboration with Germany as heroic
pacifism, he is red as a leader equal to America's legendary hero
George Washington. In popular American folklore, George Washington, who as
a boy admitted to chopping down a cherry tree, circulates as a sign of
speaking the truth. P&eacute;tain is said to speak the truth or, if unable
to do so, says nothing, as would another American hero, Benjamin Franklin
(l. 72). Key signifiers of American capitalist democracy: "business" (l.
63), "activity," and "liberty" (l. 105) mask the undemocratic,
anticapitalistic P&eacute;tainist agenda. The juxtaposition of past
historical res, of Washington and Franklin, with the present
Mar&eacute;chal effaces ideological differences between American
capitalist democracy and Vichy corporatist authoritarianism. Two national
essences, Frenchness and Americanness, are distilled and presented as
existing outside of time and history. Political events are either
mythified, like the Mar&eacute;chal's life and deeds, or problematized,
like the average Frenchman's "four points of view" (l. 60), as so
conflicting as to be resolvable only under the nationally unifying sign of
the Mar&eacute;chal.

<P>
In the process of constructing an idol of French heroism, nature, a
primary Steinian category, is superseded by a discourse of the
supernatural that articulates the armistice as a "miracle" (l. 76).
P&eacute;tain functions as what Deleuze and Guattari call a "miraculating"
agency to the degree that he, like capital in commodity culture, is the
symbolic center of nationalism around which Vichy society is
organized.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
Stein utilizes pre-Enlightenment discourse to
produce him as France's predestined leader. First, the discourse of pagan
prophesy dating from antiquity and marginalized by Christianity inscribes
the Mar&eacute;chal as a sign of supernatural protective power, a
fulfillment of the "old prediction" (l. 33) that an "old man on a white
horse" (ll. 34-35) would save France when the enemy reached Lyons.
Secondly, he is mythified as the leader in whom all have come to have
"faith" (l. 24) and who has achieved a "miracle" (l. 76).

<P>
Stein's text reinscribes the mythical thinking of the Vichy political
ideology, an archaism characteristic of fascism and Nazism and symptomatic
of culture's anxiety in the face of socially disruptive modernization. As
Gianni Vattimo explains, archaism posits a mythifying "idealization of
origins" against a secular idealization of progress: "In this perspective,
myth appears not only as not being an essentially overcome phase of our
cultural history, but precisely as a <I>more</I> authentic form of
knowledge,


<B></B>


one that precedes the destructive mentality of
objectivizing, quantitative modern science, technology, and
capitalism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 "Faith" and "miracle" are pre-Enlightenment
terms proper to the theologically based rhetoric of Christian monarchy,
which conres political leadership as a divinely ordained manifestation
of God's order and truth in the world. The ideological grounding and
political practice in the P&eacute;tainist "zone libre" (l. 39) and the
German-administered "other zone" (l. 39) is obfuscated by an appeal to
fate, a concept operative in royalist regimes ranging from ancient Greece
to modern Europe that locates the source of political legitimacy and
agency outside time and history. The mortal military officer Philippe
P&eacute;tain is elevated from the arena of the historical and political
into the realm of the mythical and magical. As "the Marechal" (l. 41), he
circulates as privileged sign of the French nation.

<P>
The trope of the Mar&eacute;chal on his white horse, however, also
signifies a country reduced to a part of itself, divided between the
reactionary government located at Vichy and the fascist forces occupying
its center. The absence of this aspect of political reality is accounted
for by what Michael Taussig calls the "chilling" effects of fetishization
("M," 229). Counteracting this chill, naming the
horse--Monastir--personalizes the trope by adding a note of warmth that
facilitates identification with the leader. The professional and personal
facts of P&eacute;tain's life are reconred as a national narrative,
"so convincing and so moving a story" (l. 7), that mythifies his victory
at Verdun, his diplomacy in the Spain of Franco (the political re
P&eacute;tain most resembles), and his investment in France as ersatz
family. All of this further constructs his leadership and armistice as
inevitable. In line with the original meaning of the word "myth" as
"narration," Stein shifts what is called the "limited
rationality"
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 of mythic discourse in reproducing the official
narrative of P&eacute;tain's "story."

<P>
Stein employs the re of the Mar&eacute;chal on his white horse in both
the "Introduction" and in "The Winner Loses: A Picture of Occupied France"
, written within two years of each other. In both pieces this re
operates as the fetish image of a benevolent, patriarchal state behind
which is masked a reactionary, racist regime, the hidden <I>maleficium</I>
of fascism. Stein's portrait of P&eacute;tain obscures her vulnerability
as a Jewish American lesbian in a hostile cultural and political
environment. If a by-product of fetishization is "intoxication" ("M,"
228), then the intoxicating aura of P&eacute;tain as a political savior
radically obscures the Vichy policies that made it an enemy of the United
States, a persecutor of Jews, and certainly no protector of sexual
minorities--traditionalist supporters of P&eacute;tain saw homosexuals as
a locus of social decadence of the 1920s and of the weaknesses of the
French Third Republic.

<P>
The foregrounding of national essence is not only a discursive tactic in
attracting American support for the armistice but also a basic strategy in
dissimulating both Jewishness and the anti-Semitic character of the Vichy
regime: one essence, Stein's Americanness, displaces another, her
Jewishness. Identifying herself as an American national she addresses her
readers as "compatriots" (l. 1), and "fellow countrymen" (l. 6). Using an
all-encompassing "we," she represents herself as being part of two
nations. On the one hand, she is American: "We in the United States . . .
" (l. 8). On


<B></B>


the other hand, she lives in France: "We have not all of
us, and I too have been of that number, over here in France . . . " (ll.
22-23). The multiplicity of Stein as a subject is reduced to
participation in nationality via the evacuation of her affiliation with a
threatened ethnicity and her practice of lesbian sexuality. The self
constructed by Stein in the "Introduction" is politically safe, a self
unified by the concept of nation. We witness what Judith Butler calls in a
discussion of the Kristevian abject the "founding repudiation" by which
abjected parts of the subject are either suppressed or projected onto
cultural Others: "For inner and outer worlds to remain utterly distinct,
the entire surface of the body would have to achieve an impossible
impermeability. This sealing of its surfaces would constitute the seamless
boundary of the subject."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The "Introduction" attempts to
achieve this "impossible impermeability" of the subject by evacuating
Stein's gender, her lesbianism, and Jewishness--those cultural practices
abjected by public discourse. Without these markers, the unified self
presented by Stein can be safely subsumed in the dominant category of "we
in France" (l. 103).

<P>
In "Portraits and Repetition," Stein analyzes the relationship between the
interior and exterior of the subject: "The composition we live in changes
but essentially what happens does not change. We inside us do not change
but our emphasis and the moment in which we live changes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

The worldview she presents here simultaneously acknowledges the mobility
of historical events and attributes a fixity to existence that suggests an
ahistorical subject, one impervious to social realities. Stein's
conviction that "what happens does not change" reflects a rejection of
history that expresses itself as the masking of Vichy politics both in the
"Introduction" and "The Winner Loses." As I will show, her theory of
subjectivity allows for the years lived under the Vichy regime to be
understood by Stein as a changing "moment" in the public sphere requiring
merely a shift in "emphasis" in the private sphere. Her concept of an
unchanging, inner layer of identity serves also as the essentialist basis
for her mythification of P&eacute;tain as national redeemer.

<P>
Bilignin par Belley, located in the foothills of the French Alps northeast
of Lyons, was the site of Stein and Toklas's country home. It was part of
the French <I>zone libre</I> from June 1940, P&eacute;tain's armistice
with Germany, until the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942,
after which Hitler's forces totally occupied France with the exception of
a small pocket <I>(la poche)</I> in the western part of the country. As
Jews, Stein and Toklas are reported to have enjoyed the protection of
persons influential with the Vichy regime, and the "Introduction" may have
been written in response to such relationships.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In any event,
the piece essentializes Stein's Americanness and aligns it with Frenchness
in a move that displaces one essence with another. In its effacement of
Stein's Jewishness by her Americanness, the "Introduction" masks the
author's ethnicity. In this sense, her self-representation as essentially
American is another self-creation similar to Stein's identification as a
male genius comparable to


<B></B>


Shakespeare and Picasso.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Such
self-creations are discursive masks that both reveal and conceal
subjectivity. For example in <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,</I>
Stein adopts the mask of Toklas in order to relate her own struggles and
accomplishments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P>
Stein's sacralization of the Mar&eacute;chal as national savior and
benevolent father masks P&eacute;tain's role as leader not only of a
collaborationist nation but also of a colonial empire, the integrity of
which P&eacute;tain attempted to defend both with and against German
military forces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The idolatrous dimension of the re of
the Mar&eacute;chal on his white horse is exemplary of what William Pietz
identifies as modernism's turn to totemism and fetishism, appropriated
from the colonized cultures of empire in the process of locating the
sacred in the modern secular state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In <I>The Autobiography
of Alice B. Toklas,</I> Stein disavows any interest in African art,
stating that it is too "sophisticated" for her "more savage" American
taste in "primitive things."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 However, her work, like that of
her modernist contemporary and "dearest friend" Picasso, shows African
influence particularly in the use of the mask.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The mask is
emblematic not only of modernism's exploration of "contradictions of
gender, nationality, and genre" but also of its implication in the
contradictions of state power and colonialism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Stein's
participation in those contradictions is made evident in <I>Paris
France</I> by her erasure of colonialism from the French empire, which she
implicitly constructs as having ended with the Second Empire in 1870, when
the Paris Commune deposed Napoleon III.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Her time in France,
forty-one years of Stein's adult life, was, however, a period in which the
French both solidified and celebrated their foreign domination, most
notably with the Parisian Colonial Exposition of 1931, which marked the
hundredth anniversary of the Algerian expedition. This history, however,
is masked.

<P>
The mask is a principal discursive product of Stein's "Introduction." Her
ostensible purpose is to present "the words" (l. 1) of P&eacute;tain in a
way that invites the American public to identify with the French as a
national group. Her encoding of the Mar&eacute;chal as the savior of the
French nation is designed to promote a rereading by Americans of his
armistice, concluded on 22 June 1940 with Nazi Germany. The idolatrous
gaze reconstructs the armistice as an act of heroism, mystifying it as a
"miracle, without arms without any means of defense" (l. 76). With
metaphysical terms like "miracle" and "faith," Stein reanimates the
discourse of idolatry that articulates pre-Renaissance power structures of
church and state before the secularization of vision by science.

<P>
The religious investment in Philippe P&eacute;tain as state mask is
intensified at the end of the "Introduction" with the capitalization and
repetition of the word "miracle": "the Miracle which is a miracle, and his
defense of his armistice has been a miracle went on being a miracle, and
here it still is" (ll. 95-96). The repetition of the word "miracle"
overdetermines the sacred dimension of the Mar&eacute;chal and "his
armistice" (l. 95) as invested with supernatural powers that defy the
<I>rapport de force</I> with the Germans, who are made to "more or less
keep their word with him" (l. 77). This shift to the metaphysical on
Stein's part corresponds to the tendency of the modern secular state to
assume the theological powers once associated with church and monarchy.



<B></B>


Discursively, the move to the metaphysical dissimulates the political
import of the Mar&eacute;chal's armistice, illustrating what Philip Abrams
calls the use of the "state as mask":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The state is not the reality which stands behind the mask of political
practice. It is itself the mask which prevents our seeing political
practice as it is [and] it starts its life as an implicit construct; it is
then reified--as the <I>res publica, </I>the public reification, no
less--and acquires an overt symbolic identity progressively divorced from
practice as an illusory account of practice.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
An "illusory account of practice" is given in the mythified relations
between P&eacute;tain and occupying German authorities attempting to
appropriate materials in the free zone: "The Marechal said, I do not wish
it. The Germans and the people around the Marechal said what can you do
about it. I can do nothing about it said the Marechal but I do not wish
it. And it ended in their not doing it" (ll. 84-87). Eclipsed by the
Mar&eacute;chal's charismatic image and therefore absent from Stein's
account are profascist Foreign Minister Pierre Laval and ultraconservative
Admiral Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Darlan, both chief negotiators of the details
of Franco-German collaboration, which included Vichy's anti-Semitic race
laws and the forced labor of French workers in Germany.

<P>
Given the replacement of equestrian warfare by modern weapons machinery
during World War I, the trope of the Mar&eacute;chal on his white horse is
a distinct cultural anachronism. As such, it resembles the "baroque ocular
regime" as a contradiction of the rationalistic strivings of bourgeois
industrial democracy, which is precisely the source of its power as a sign
of political reaction; P&eacute;tain's anachronistic image represents "the
uncanny double of what we might call the dominant scientific or
'rationalized' visual order."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 He is inscribed as the sign of
traditionalist patriarchal benevolence abstracted and dissociated from the
authoritarianism of his regime following the Third Republic, the failure
of which he attributes in his speeches to the excesses of
democracy.

Stein's foregrounding of nation as a category effaces the importance of
the actual historical events that led to the installation of the Vichy
regime.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 P&eacute;tain's past military victory in World War I
is used to mask the oppressive political character of the armistice. If
the nation, as Benedict Anderson says, is "an imagined political
community," P&eacute;tainist France is organized around the imagination of
class unity and racial purity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The concept of the unification
of the classes is articulated in the conventions of work <I>(les
conventions de travail)</I> announced by P&eacute;tain on 10 October 1940
that outlaw both lock-outs and strikes: "They [professional organizations]
will then avoid conflicts through an absolute interdiction of 'lock-outs'
and strikes, through obligatory arbitration of the work
tribunals."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Class unity takes the form of a mandatory
"community of work" <I>("une communaut&eacute; de travail")</I> or
state-sponsored


<B></B>


unions dedicated to the prosperity of "the company"
<I>("l'entreprise").</I> On 1 March 1941 P&eacute;tain explains: "In
reality, the causes of class conflict will only be able to be suppressed
if the worker, who lives today burdened by his isolation, rediscovers a
community of work, dignified and free living conditions as well as reasons
for living and hoping. This community is the company."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

P&eacute;tain's corporatist vision offers "reasons for living and hoping"
that religion traditionally sought to provide. The discourse of his
agrarian, traditionalist National Revolution appropriates key signifiers
of the industrial bourgeois ideology that it strives to replace.
Enlightenment values, dignity and freedom, are to be actualized by a
reified authoritarian state. The government-mandated company union, a
compulsory workers' corporation with no bargaining rights, is a central
organizing structure of Vichy state capitalism.

<P>
In Stein's "Introduction," the urban working class, Jews, and women are
absent from her picture of the French, and the trope of the
Mar&eacute;chal as symbol of national unity eclipses P&eacute;tain's
anti-labor, anti-Semitic, anti-feminist programs as outlined in those
speeches. In <I>Paris France,</I> Stein takes an equally depoliticized
view of unemployment as related to the demands of twentieth-century
industrial productivity. In discussing how the French "always" put at
least seven men on any job, she reflects: "The nineteenth century knew
just what to do with each man but the twentieth century inevitably was not
to know . . . " (<I>PF,</I> 13). In Stein, economics are separated from
politics by naturalizing business as a part of daily life; social
conflicts resulting from culture's incorporation of new modes of
production remain part of the unessential historical.

<P>
In what is known as the National Revolution of 10 July 1940, P&eacute;tain
is given full power <I>(plein pouvoir)</I> by the French parliament.
Foreign Minister Pierre Laval begins orchestrating close collaboration
between the "new order" in France and Nazi Germany as part of the latter's
plan for a "New Europe." On 24 October 1940, P&eacute;tain meets with
Hitler at Montoire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 As distinct from the factionalized French
fascists, P&eacute;tain was a traditionalist supported by the agrarian and
small business sectors, those disappointed in parliamentary democracy and
laissez-faire capitalism who wanted to return to preindustrial guilds,
agriculture, and the patriarchal family as the bases of economic and
social life. Similar themes appear in <I>Paris France,</I> where, however,
Stein constructs "the gentle farmers" as apolitical, as knowing "life as
it is" (<I>PF,</I> 27), implying that essential life is ahistorical.
Quoting "one of the gentlest" (<I>PF,</I> 27), she represents the farmers
as skeptical of modern urban democracy and its ambitious, calculating
politicians <I>(les grosses t&ecirc;tes)</I> to the point of passive
resignation:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

everybody used to think that it was kings who were ambitious who were
greedy and who brought misery to the people who had no way to resist them.

. . . They talk about cutting off the heads of the grosses t&ecirc;tes but
now we know that there will be other grosses t&ecirc;tes and they will be
all the same. [<I>PF,</I> 28]
<!--_/extract-->

<P>
The gentleness of farmers is naturalized, aligned with the rhythms of
life, the "seasons," and "harvesting" (<I>PF,</I> 28). Their way of life
is opposed to the turnover of corrupt


<B></B>


politicians and the violence of
guillotine politics. Farmers are cast as those who supposedly "know" the
futility of political commitment and are thus dissociated from an
anonymous "they" who speak of taking action.

<P>
In his speech on 10 October 1940, largely attributed to the
anticapitalist, antiparliamentarian Gaston Bergery, the Mar&eacute;chal
explains that Vichy's planned "social hierarchy" will no longer be based
on "the false idea of human natural equality," one of the three
fundamental values of the French Revolution: <I>Libert&eacute;,
Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute;.</I> Among the French, with the
exception of the Jews, considered noncitizens, equality is to be replaced
by "equal opportunity" to "serve" the state: "The new order will be a
social hierarchy. It will no longer rest on the false idea of human
natural equality but on the necessary idea of equality of opportunity
given to all the French to prove their aptitude at
'serving.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 However, French big-business practices and
compulsory work in Germany imposed on French laborers as Mandatory Work
Service <I>(le Service du Travail Obligatoire)</I> slowly created a system
of cartels that overpowered the corporations organized by Vichy
legislation. A major part of France's role in Hitler's "New Europe," like
that of the countries under total German occupation, was to contribute to
the Nazi expansionist war effort.

<P>
It is within the context of the rise of the traditionalists to political
power that Stein discusses French tradition two years earlier in <I>Paris
France:</I> "I cannot write too much upon how necessary it is to be
completely conservative that is particularly traditional in order to be
free. And so France is and was. Sometimes it is important and sometimes it
is not, but from 1900 to 1939, it certainly was." (<I>PF,</I> 38) In
P&eacute;tainist France, freedom consists in submission to the
conservative values of agrarian patriarchy that extol the family and the
farm as the foundations of French society. Stein's analysis of French
culture demonstrates how the three fundamental values of the 1789
republican revolution, liberty, fraternity, and equality applied little to
women and the family but remained abstractions pertaining primarily to men
in the public sphere. In a reversal of the universal "human" as male and
public, Stein assigns these masculine ideals as observed in France to the
"not human." The "human" she ascribes to the essential quotidian and the
traditions of the private sphere where equality, "intimacy" (as a synonym
of the solidarity and reciprocity of fraternity), and liberty,
particularly in sexual relations, are said not to apply:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Frenchmen love older women, that is women who have already done more
living, and that has something to do with civilisation, they do not
believe in comradeship really not with any one, they said in their
revolution Egalit&eacute; Fraternit&eacute; Libert&eacute;, but these
qualities should be left to war and politics, they are not human. Humanly
speaking, Frenchwomen nor Frenchmen do not really interest themselves in
intimacy, intimacy is something essentially uncivilised, civilisation
makes young men interested in a woman of thirty and an interest in a
spirit of equality with a very young woman is more or less a sign of
senility, and senility is of course not civilised. [<I>PF,</I> 39]

masculine arena of war and politics. "Human" in France is a marker of the
traditional stability of the feminine domestic sphere grounded in female
objectification. Regardless of age or sophistication, Frenchwomen remain
sexual objects, a <I>rapport de force</I> highlighted by Stein in
deconstructing the image of French "civilisation" to reveal its foundation
in gender inequality.

<P>
Like women and workers, Jews go unmentioned in Stein's "Introduction."
Jewishness is alluded to in passing by a formulaic phrase that duplicates
the racist, anti-leftist discourse of Vichy France: "the people who helped
to ruin France" (ll. 65-66). Those who "ruined" France, in the
right-wing rhetoric of the time, were Jews, Marxists, bourgeois democrats,
and Third Republic politicians whom reactionaries held responsible for the
French defeat of 1940. These groups were blamed by ultraconservatives
first for social decadence in the 1920s, the symptoms of which were
described as American jazz and whisky, women's short hair, hemlines, birth
control, and employment outside the home. Second, the stigmatized groups
were aligned with the socialist agitation and working-class discontent
that led to the social reforms in 1936 of the Popular Front under
L&eacute;on Blum, classified as "errors" (<I>"erreurs"</I> [<I>D,</I> 88])
by P&eacute;tain, who on 10 October 1940 declares: "This defeat has
numerous causes, but all are not of a technical type; the disaster is, in
reality, only the reflection at the military level of the weaknesses and
the defects of the former political regime."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 "Defects"
<I>("tares"),</I> which connote physical or moral flaws, is a highly
charged term frequently employed in anti-Semitic discourse of the period
describing Jews.

<P>
In general, Jews, leftists, and republicans were associated by the
conservative Right with other signs of French decline since Louis XIV and
Napoleon Bonaparte, notably the drop in France's population and its loss
of political influence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 P&eacute;tain includes decreased
population and lost allies among the causes of the failure of Third
Republic parliamentarianism to prepare France for armed conflict with
Germany. Failed family and social policies are alluded to in justifying
the armistice: "Less strong than twenty-two years ago, we also had fewer
friends, too few children, too few weapons, too few allies. Those are the
causes of our defeat."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 In his analysis of this address,
Robert Paxton points out how "P&eacute;tain's lapidary formula for defeat
in his June 20 speech carried the debate deftly from the realms of foreign
policy and military doctrine to the realm of social
decadence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 As a lesbian, Jew, and experimental writer, Stein
bore crucial markers of what French reactionaries considered culturally
decadent. In Maria Damon's words: "Stein embodied all of the golden
triangle of European outsiderhood . . . Jews, gay people, and
women."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 The United States had not yet entered the war against
Germany, during the Vichy regime, which made being an American with a
pro-P&eacute;tainist message the one politically safe position that could
be foregrounded in the "Introduction." In this context, Stein's piece may
have been conceived as a means of influencing America to remain neutral.

<P>
According to the racial policies adopted in the first three months of
P&eacute;tain's government, the Jewish subject-position is the least safe
category for Stein, placing her as it does among "the people who helped to
ruin France" (ll. 65-66). In its reproduction 


<B></B>


of P&eacute;tain's
discourse of social purity, this key phrase of the "Introduction" reveals
what it otherwise conceals as a text, that is, the antidemocratic,
anti-Semitic agenda of the France "saved" by the Mar&eacute;chal (l. 3).
P&eacute;tain announces on 9 October 1940 the exclusion of Jews from the
practice of law and medicine and from entry into public service,
euphemistically formulated as "the law on admission to certain
professions" <I>("la loi sur l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; certaines
professions"):</I> "Naturalization reform, the law on admission to certain
professions, the dissolution of secret groups, the search for those
responsible for our disaster, the suppression of alcoholism testify to a
firm will to apply in all areas a consistent effort at healing and
reconstruction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 As Michael Marrus and Robert Paxton observe,
directly naming the Jews as undesirable was subtly avoided by
P&eacute;tain's speechwriters, who placed the Jewish population in
opposition to positive terms like "healing" and
"reconstruction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 In the above-cited address of 9 October,
P&eacute;tain is referring primarily to the "Statute on the Jews"
<I>(Statut des juifs)</I> passed 3 October, which defined Jewish
citizenship as constitutionally inferior and which then proceeded to
exclude Jews from high positions in the French military, public
administration, elected office, media, and education. The law specifically
delineated the Jewish identity upon which it based its exclusionary
politics by considering "as Jewish every person descended from three
grandparents of the Jewish race or of two grandparents of that same race
if his/her spouse is himself/herself Jewish."

<P>
Stein presumably wrote her "Introduction to the Speeches of
Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain" to cover the addresses from the time of his
taking power in June 1940 to January 1942, when she sent the piece to
Bennett Cerf at Random House. The speeches are represented as containing
the Mar&eacute;chal's "story," as if what Stein were introducing were a
biography or literary fiction; the mythification at work in her piece
accounts for its particular treatment of specific political conflicts. The
generic Frenchman, "one French one. . . . he" (ll. 59-60), is
constructed through the exclusion not only of women, Jews, homosexuals,
and workers but also through the ellipsis of conflicting groups within the
generic white French male category. In presenting what are "quite
logically"
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 his contradictory "four points of view" (l. 60) on
France's political situation, there is slippage between the pragmatic
concerns (saving a son and doing business) and the almost unmentionable
ideological conflicts in which they are framed (maintaining P&eacute;tain
as totem safeguard of the nation, excluding those "who helped to ruin
France" [ll. 65-66], and the "complicating" [l. 67] implications of
Russian communism):

one French one has quite logically perhspas [perhaps] four points of view.
Supposing he has a son a prisoner, well he wants the war over as quickly
as possible so that his son will come home, so he wants the Germans to win
as that would finish the quickest, at the same time he is a business man
and he wants business to go on, and that would only happen if the Germans
were defeated and England won, then he wants the Marechal and as the
English are opposed to him they would insist on bringing back into France
all the people who helped to ruin France so they do not want England to
win and then there is Russia, and that is ever more complicating. [ll.

<P>
On a mundane level this slippage accounts for the confusion concerning
whether there are three or four points of view being described. However,
at the ideological level, it is the re of the Mar&eacute;chal who is
cast as subsuming and thus resolving the opposing "points of view"
curtailing serious discussion of fascism, Nazi German occupation, and
those individuals who have been persecuted for the military debacle of
1940. The gender, class, sexual, and racial composition of the "new
France" is the absent subject of the "Introduction": the invisible face of
a diverse population obscured by the unifying state mask of the
Mar&eacute;chal.

<B>The Eclipse of History by Literature</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Four years earlier in <I>The Geographical History of America or the
Relation of Human Nature to the Human Mind</I> , Stein was equating
politics and religion with propaganda: "And everybody does say what they
do say. This makes propaganda and politics and religion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

This negative equivocation of politics and speaking, saying what people
"do say," with propaganda sets it apart from the process of writing and
literature, which articulate another kind of history. In foregrounding the
quotidian, Stein resembles Walter Benjamin's chronicler who does not
distinguish between "large and small" events and who does not identify
with the "winners" in history but instead reads history "against the
grain" in order that nothing of the past be lost in rendering a balanced
vision of culture's chronicle: "He regards it as his assignment to brush
history against the grain."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P>
The primacy given literature over history and politics by Stein is
expressed in "The Winner Loses: A Picture of Occupied France," which
recounts the military and political events leading to the fall of the
Third Republic under Paul Reynaud and the establishment of the Vichy
government. The article appeared in the November 1940 issue of the
<I>Atlantic Monthly</I> and describes in detail Stein and Toklas's
experiences in France following the country's defeat by Germany. I will
discuss "The Winner Loses" at length here because it provides a "picture"
of public and private events missing from the "Introduction." Like the
"Introduction," it is structured around the central visual trope of the
Mar&eacute;chal on his white horse, which is again invested with
fetishistic power to mask the realities of Vichy politics. "The Winner
Loses" describes daily living in rural France of the survivors of the
national defeat <I>(la d&eacute;b&acirc;cle)</I> and Nazi occupation. It
constructs a continuous quotidian as the stabilizing essence for the
modern subject, opposed to the destabilizing, discontinuous events of
history.

<P>
"The Winner Loses," like the "Introduction," is a pragmatic defense of
P&eacute;tain's armistice that privileges daily life over history: "It was
not like the last war, when all the men were dead or badly wounded;
practically nobody was wounded and very few were dead. Everybody forgot
about being defeated, it was such a relief that their men were not
dead."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 For the pacifist Stein, history in the form of
political defeat can be forgotten, but death cannot be reversed.
Similarly, the "Introduction" attempts to foreground the normalizing
effect of the armistice with the French "accepting their life" (l. 39)
either in the Nazi-occupied northern half of France or


<B></B>


the
Vichy-governed southern half of the country. However, the text
simultaneously deconstructs this image of normal life in occupied France
by citing concern about the age of the mortal P&eacute;tain, an anxiety
resolved only by his mythification as Mar&eacute;chal, the political
miracle-worker (ll. 38-42). In contrast to what Stein sees in "The
Winner Loses" as history's "troublesome" events in the form of political
"disturbances" ("WL," 617), she repeatedly valorizes what she calls in
<I>Paris France</I> the "real business of daily living" (<I>PF,</I> 8) as
an immutable necessity, an absolute that transcends the fluctuations of
politics and history. In accordance with this binary, the
historical/quotidian, the urban is coded as the barren arena of politics
while the rural becomes the nurturing source of survival. Absent from
these texts is any recognition of the ideological similarity of the powers
controlling the Vichy agrarian "free zone" and the Nazi-administered
Parisian metropolis.

<P>
The apolitical countryside is positioned in the center of Stein's picture
of occupied France, with the political city on its periphery: "the country
is a better place in war than a city. They grow the things to eat right
where you are so there is no privation" ("WL," 616). Food and physical
comfort are foregrounded; in the background remain, nevertheless, the
ideological issues involved in the war going on around her.

<P>
Stein offers an apolitical reading of the fall of the Third Republic on 16
June 1940 when Reynaud
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 is replaced by P&eacute;tain and the
Vichy government is formed. She reduces government to two functions,
domestic "policing" and foreign "defending." Her duplication of
P&eacute;tainist discourse on failures of the Third Republic vindicates
the installation of the Vichy regime and evacuates ideological differences
that for workers, women, and Jews did not allow life to continue as "the
same":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In the meantime the government of France had changed, but that did
not worry anyone.

It was natural that, since the Third Republic had not defended them

<BR>
As I said in <I>Paris France, </I>to the French a government is
something outside which does not concern them; its business is policing,
defending them from their enemies; it is to be hoped that it will not cost
too much, and naturally it leaves every one to lead their own French life.
<BR>
<BR>
And so naturally the government had changed, but their life was to
go on all the same. ["WL," 634]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Stein's text highlights nature, an essential category that obliterates
differences in particular political ideologies. The replacement of the
Third Republic is "natural" because it failed in foreign policy and
warfare. This change in government "naturally" left "every one to lead
their own French life," a life constructed as an ahistorical essence
untouched by the political upheavals taking place in both the occupied and
"free" zones. Missing are those excluded as noncitizens by the Vichy order
from participation in "French life." The passage is also inflected by the
language of laissez-faire capitalism. The "business" of government is
limited to armed-force policing internally, defending externally, and
otherwise not interfering in French living.


<B></B>


Excluded from government
are the domains of social and economic policy that regulate race, family,
labor, and corporate relations. "Naturally" the primary concern of the
French citizen is that government not cost too much. The discourses of
nature and business are foregrounded and interwoven to produce a
naturalized capitalism, while government is reduced to the "business" of
discipline.

<P>
In <I>Paris France,</I> the country's intense history of class struggle
and revolution, a history that continues to inflect the ideological
conflicts taking place around Stein, is similarly minimized. However, this
depoliticized vision of French society is called into question by a moment
of confrontation within the text. When Stein asks a servant whom she
considers a "friend" what political party the woman's husband belongs to,
she learns that party affiliation in France is so significant as to be a
taboo subject with one's employers:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
She always had told me everything even the most intimate troubles with her
family and her husband but when I said that, what party does your husband
belong to, her face grew rigid. She did not answer. What is the matter
with you H&eacute;l&egrave;ne I said, is it a secret. No Mademoiselle she
answered it is not a secret but one does not tell it. One does not tell
the political party one belongs to. Even I have a political party but I do
not tell it. [<I>PF,</I> 9]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As a bourgeoise, Stein is addressed by H&eacute;l&egrave;ne as
"Mademoiselle," with the marker of her superior class. It is Stein's
unshared privilege to be on a first-name basis with her servant. Viewed
within the context of French political history, these class differences
can assume, at any given moment, the utmost importance, as testified to by
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne's suddenly "rigid" expression. The inadvisability of
revealing one's party membership springs from almost two centuries of
violent class struggle, a history effaced in other ways in the text.

<B>The Essential Quotidian</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Focused on the essentialized, stabilizing quotidian, Stein's picture of
occupied France in "The Winner Loses" includes political change only
negatively, that is, to the degree that it disrupts daily living. Viewed
from below, the struggles of history appear as a series of ideology-free
disturbances of quotidian continuity. Maria Diedrich maintains that it was
Stein's intention to rewrite the war as she had lived it in order to
deconstruct the entire category of history: "she shattered the belief that
an event like World War II can still be reconstructed according to the
rules of what Jacques Derrida was later to call logocentrism, that is, the
cultural hegemony of sense--rationality, linearity, and hierarchical
order."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 However, it is important to note to what degree Stein
constructs daily life itself as the source of rational knowing, linear
continuity, and immanent presence. In <I>Paris France,</I> "The Winner
Loses," and the "Introduction," the quotidian appears each time as the
privileged category.

<P>
Just before the armistice, when Italy enters the war, Stein's
depoliticized mapping of France is challenged, and she is frightened,
"completely scared" ("WL," 622).


<B></B>


Bilignin, just east of Lyons, is in
the direct path of the Italian forces. Stein's point of view widens to
include the possible necessity of leaving for Bordeaux, where the Third
Republic government has taken refuge since 7 June, the date the French
front at the Somme River fell to Germany. The American consul in Lyons is
included in her broadened picture, briefly linking the public and private
spheres by personally advising Stein, "Do not hesitate--leave." ("WL,"
623) However, the drive back from Lyons is so "heavenly" ("WL," 623) that
it displaces the danger of the war in her mind, and Stein again shifts her
focus from the disorienting politics of the city and the encroaching world
war to the comfortable routines of rural, apolitical domesticity: "They
all said, 'Leave,' and I said to Alice Toklas, 'Well, I don't know--it
would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food. Let's not
leave.'" ("WL," 623) The familiar safety of the Vichy-controlled
countryside cannot totally blot out the reality of the war, which
eventually comes so close that Toklas insists they flee. Their passports
must be "visaed" for Spain, and Stein, who is unenthusiastic about
leaving, finds that a "compromise" is to drive back to Lyons instead of
going on to Bordeaux ("WL," 623). Fleeing to Spain would mean too radical
a break in the essentialized quotidian that offers a sense of the
continuous, in which the home becomes a signifier of that continuity to be
"saved." In resolving the conflict between staying and leaving, the advice
of a French physician friend is sought:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"Well," said Doctor Chaboux, reflecting, "I can't guarantee you
anything, but my advice is stay. I had friends," he said, "who in the last
war stayed in their homes all through the German occupation, and they
saved their homes and those who left lost theirs. "No," he said, "I think
unless your house is actually destroyed by a bombardment, I always think
the best thing to do is to stay." He went on, "Everybody knows you here;
everybody likes you; we all would help you in every way. Why risk yourself
among strangers?"
<BR>
<BR>
"Thank you," we said, "that's all we need. We stay." ["WL," 624]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The apolitical resists the dominant order of things as well as a universal
narrative of its history in two ways. First of all, it is dialectically
adversarial and, as Michel Foucault would say, irreducibly inscribed in
power in the form of power's opposite. The reduction of existence to an
essential "daily living" inscribed in literature resists the metanarrative
of political history. Second, Stein's apolitical position is what Teresa
de Lauretis would see as resistance in the form of "pure negativity,"
operating not out of opposition but as "a non-force, an absolute
difference with respect to power."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Stein's deconstructive
inversion of the binary victory/defeat is an example of resistance as pure
negativity: "and perhaps everybody will find out, as the French know so
well, that the winner loses, and everybody will be, too, like the French,
that is, tremendously occupied with the business of daily living, and that
will be enough." ("WL," 637) Military victory is "purely" negated by
equating it with defeat, and "daily living" (power's opposite) is opposed
to history's war (power). This opposition, however, collapses when the
cultural historicity of the quotidian emerges with the intrusion

fantasy that belongs more to fiction than to the civilized peace and logic
of "real life." This functions as a method of containment; it fixes war as
an abstraction contained by art, as the object of an empowering gaze: "War
is more like a novel than it is like real life and that is its eternal
fascination. It is a thing based on reality but invented, it is a dream
made real, all the things that make a novel but not really life."
(<I>PF,</I> 38) Stein's critical gaze denies war its destructive power and
is positioned from the vantage point of an observer who has not yet had to
escape Paris from the invading Germans. Having fled Paris to regain the
security of daily routine in Bilignin, Stein in "The Winner Loses" again
trains an aestheticizing gaze on the war. The act of looking is premised
on both the degree of danger and the territoriality of the spectacle. For
example, the visual pleasure of observing enemy airplanes "flying very
feebly" ("WL," 621) is experienced as more intense in an "open," "wooded"
space than in the city: "Of course we were all really excited; enemy
airplanes in a city are depressing, but in the open country, with wooded
hills all around, they are exciting." ("WL," 621) However, as the conflict
approaches, Stein expresses ambivalence about the war witnessed both as
attractive spectacle and intrusive media event. On the one hand, the
vision of nonhostile enemy aircraft is seductive; on the other, radio
broadcasts force a confrontation with the war's reality that Stein prefers
to avoid: "Alice Toklas could listen to the wireless, but as for me I was
going to cut box hedges and forget the war." ("WL," 623)

<P>
In a culture in which vision more than hearing determines perception and
representation, not listening to the mediated presentation of the war on
the radio is easier than not looking at the unmediated sight of German
airplanes. For example, Stein and unanticipated acquaintances from the
city only occasionally tune in to radio transmissions pertaining to the
war: "There were a number of people all around spending the winter
unexpectedly in the country, so we had plenty of society and we talked
about the war, but not too much, and we had hired a radio wireless and we
listened to it but not too much and the winter was all too soon over."
("WL," 616) The unexpected arrivals from the city offer "society," a form
of verbal as well as visual interaction that rivals the mere aural appeal
of the radio and thereby distracts from the menace of the war. The
cultural hegemony of vision makes the war's aural representation easier to
resist than its appearance as visual spectacle.

<P>
The specularization of the war as a commodity confronts Stein with the
relationship between the photograph and the photographed. When Stein and
Toklas encounter German forces on the road to Belley they cannot "believe"
their eyes: "we saw them, quantities of soldiers in gray uniforms, trucks,
motorcycles, armored cars. We could not believe our eyes, but there they
were. It was not real, but there they were;


<B></B>


it looked like
photographs in a magazine, but there they were." ("WL," 631) The two
women, incredulous at what they see, dissociate themselves from the real
threat by recognizing the troops as images previously encountered in
magazine photographs, and subsequently experience the troops' presence as
"not real." Stein's uncertainty as to the danger presented by the soldiers
is a response to the camera's ability to convey both illusion and reality
as well as its ability to obscure political ideology. Because of the
absence of any contextualizing ideology and doubled as they are with their
previously encountered magazine photos, the Nazi forces appear
simultaneously familiar and unknown. The familiar media image of Nazis as
menacing invaders is transformed into an unfamiliar picture of them as
docile consumers. Visions of armed threat are superimposed with
impressions of courteous civility. Observed from the parked car, Belley's
main street becomes the scene of an uncanny spectacle: Hitler's soldiers
quietly shopping. Stein the spectator watches the "very polite and very
correct" Germans with her "own eyes," unmediated by photographic
representation: "It was strange sitting there watching the people up and
down on the main street of Belley . . . and now added to it were these
familiar and unfamiliar German soldiers, familiar because we had seen
their photographs in illustrated papers all winter and unfamiliar because
we never dreamed we would see them with our own eyes." ("WL," 631) Stein's
"strange" experience in observing the Nazi troops is a symptom of what one
critic calls modernity's disorienting "crisis in ocularcentrism," the loss
of belief in scopic objectivity as a means of knowing and controlling
reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 The representational gap shatters any understanding
of the quotidian as a privileged domain safe from the incursions of
political history.

<P>
Although the penetration by the German soldiers into the local community
destroys the illusion of safe distance, their observed behavior is
reassuring. Stein's crisis in vision involves a double inversion: reality
is first located in the camera image; then confrontation provokes a shift
and their presence becomes real, superseding their photographic image:
"Everything about them was exactly like the photographs we had seen except
themselves; they were not the least bit like we thought they would be."
("WL," 632) Stein's position as a spectator is displaced from that of
magazine reader in a relatively sovereign consumer society to that of
eyewitness in a corporatist state indirectly under foreign military rule.
The reconration of the soldiers as intensely civil shoppers renders
banal the presence of Hitler's forces. Consumption becomes the great
equalizer between conqueror and conquered, effacing the surrounding
political <I>rapport de force.</I>

<P>
The momentary docility of the troops is in fact a product of the military
power-arrangements governing Belley as part of the Vichy-administered
"free zone" established by P&eacute;tain's armistice, the "Introduction"'s
"miracle, without arms" (l. 76). Moreover, as the occupiers of French
everyday life, they reveal themselves to be avid purchasers of the exotic
pleasures that this power affords them: "They did not look like
conquerors; they were very quiet. They bought a great deal, all sugar
things, cakes and candies, all silk stockings, women's shoes, beauty
products and fancy soaps, but always everlastingly what the American
soldiers in the last war called 'eats'--that


<B></B>


is, anything
sweet--and anything that looked like champagne." ("WL," 631) Stein's
account of what the soldiers buy gives a precise picture of the libidinal
impulses inflecting conquest and occupation. The sweet oral gratifications
and the women's luxuries, presumably to be exchanged for sexual pleasure,
translate the erotic dimension of France into the economy of a conquered
political geography.

[In her late works about occupied France, Stein seems to violate her
earlier prescriptions about seeing as intensely as possible. Now in order
to see clearly she must avert her gaze, avoid seeing an occupying force as
operatives of fascism; German troops become consumers, P&eacute;tain
becomes a pre-nineteenth-century equestrian statue. If this ideological
blinkering seems a decline in Stein's aesthetic standards, a substitution
of the experiential eye for the journalistic photo, it is part of a
general "public" stance adopted following the publication of <I>The
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I> and the success of her American tour
in the 1930s. Furthermore she was not alone in her veneration for the
"heroes" of the occupation, the most infamous example being Ezra Pound's
rather similar memory of P&eacute;tain in Canto 80 ("P&eacute;tain
defended Verdun while Blum / was defending a bidet").
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 The
fact that Stein was herself vulnerable to the death-camp trains and
summary deportation must be taken into account.

<P>
Still, these are disquieting moments in an otherwise exemplary
experimentalist enterprise that gave little corner to what Louis Zukofsky
called "predatory intent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
In our desire to understand
modernism's complicity with conservative--even fascist
--impulses, we need to see its validation of totality, its veneration of
genius and power, its ocularcentrism as excrescences--not distractions--in
an authoritarian impulse. Bennett Cerf's remark on the manuscript of
Stein's essay ("This disgusting piece") registers our retrospective dismay
over Stein's attempt to whitewash a bad time. By making his remark "For
the record," he attempts to distance himself from the manuscript that
follows. Yet he registers the feelings of Americans living far from the
battlefields of wartime Europe for whom "occupation" must still seem
something of an abstraction. The "Introduction to the Speeches of
Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain" provides an important record of Stein's
problematic relationship to modern history--a history that she liked to
think she helped invent. If she invented the aesthetics by which it could
be transcended, she was, as the "Introduction" demonstrates, deeply caught
in its fault lines.]

Philippe Henri P&eacute;tain (1856-1951) was marshal of France
andstopped the advance of Germans at Verdun during World War I. In
defense of
France's colonial empire, he jointly led the French-Spanish campaign
against Moroccan Riffian tribe leader Abd-el-Krim in 1926. P&eacute;tain
served as ambassador to Spain between 1939 and 1940, when in June he
succeeded Paul Reynaud as premier and concluded an armistice with Nazi
Germany. In what is called the National Revolution, led by a coalition of
antidemocratic forces from the traditionalist agrarian Right to the
anti-industrialist Left, a rudimentary parliament suspended the
constitution of the Third Republic in July and P&eacute;tain was made
chief of the new state <I>(chef de l'&eacute;tat)</I> at Vichy, France.
Losing power as of 1942 to the German-backed profascist prime minister
Pierre Laval, P&eacute;tain remained a rehead until fleeing with the
rest of the Vichy government to Germany in 1944. At the end of World War
II, P&eacute;tain was tried for treason and condemned to death, but de
Gaulle commuted his sentence to life imprisonment.

Shortly after the canonization of Jeanne d'Arc by the Roman CatholicChurch
on 9 May 1920, the Third Republic legislated a commemoration of
Jeanne d'Arc as the celebration of patriotism, to be held each year on the
second Sunday in May. In his speech of 11 May 1941, P&eacute;tain employs
her in the service of his conservative National Revolution as the image of
traditionalist agrarianism devoted to a masculine prince and a masculine
god: "Countrywoman from our borderlands to the East, loyal to her land,
loyal to her prince, loyal to her God, Jeanne traced with her flag the
brightest path of our history" ("Paysanne de nos marches de l'Est,

After the armistice of June 1940, radio communication between Vichyand
the French colonies was disrupted when the Parisian short-wave station
became independent of government control. With the help of occupying
German officials, the station was reorganized as "Radio-Mondial."
Transmission to the colonies resumed on 3 September with an address to the
overseas territories by P&eacute;tain in which he impressed upon them
their duty to "obey" the new power structure. In other words, the colonies
now had two masters, France and Germany, and any attempt to separate from
France, understood as itself and all its colonial possessions, regardless
of the "ideal" inspiring independence, would be crushed: "It [France's
unity] cannot be questioned. No attempt, on whatever side, dressed in
whatever ideal, will prevail against it. The first duty today is to obey"
("Elle [l'unit&eacute; de la France] ne peut pas &ecirc;tre mise en cause.
Aucune tentative, de quelque c&ocirc;t&eacute; qu'elle vienne, de quelque
id&eacute;al qu'elle se pare, ne saurait pr&eacute;valoir contre elle. Le
premier devoir est aujourd'hui d'ob&eacute;ir." [<I>D,</I> 80]). In July
1941, a five-car train exhibiting products and gifts from the overseas
territories circulated in the "free zone" as a type of traveling
mini-colonial exposition. The purpose of the exposition was to celebrate
the support provided France by its colonies. In a speech broadcast 13 July
1941, P&eacute;tain emphasizes France as their supposedly shared
fatherland <I>("de la Patrie"),</I> further articulating the fiction that
the Empire is an organic whole composed of native peoples who "love" the
conquerors now "defending" them. The colonized are placed in the
contradictory, if not schizophrenic, situation of having to identify as
their own the forces that conquered them:

In <I>Paris France,</I> written toward the end of the Third Republic,Stein
distinguishes the Third Republic from the Second Empire of Napoleon
III by ironizing its unswerving application of democratic forms of
civility:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To be sure everybody in the republic was addressed as Monsieur and Madame.
Even the butcher boy quite young would say bon-jour Madame to our servant
and she would equally seriously bon-jour Monsieur to him although he was
only fifteen. I do not know whether during the empire this was true. . . .
<BR>

Beside the republic so far has pretty well done what they all think
a government should do, let them alone, protected them, on the whole, from
the enemy, and though it costs a good deal, this government, it might cost
more if it were another government. . . . so as governments go the third
republic is not so bad. [<I>PF,</I> 110-11]

Part of the cost of the Third Republic was the maintaining of its colonial
empire, which under Napoleon III had tripled in size. Napoleon, besides
enlarging existing possessions, contributed Cochin China, the Suez Canal,
and intervention in Mexico to install Emperor Maximillian (1864-67).
The insurrections in Algeria at the end of the Second Empire proved costly
to the Third Republic, yet its participation in European imperialist
expansion between 1880 and 1914 was even costlier. The Third Republic
acquired Tonkin in Indochina, Madagascar , Laos , French West
Africa , and French Equatorial Africa . The Sahara was
conquered (1882-1902). Mauritania  and Morocco were made French
protectorates . At the end of World War I, the League of Nations
accorded France mandates over Togo, Cameroon, Syria, and Lebanon. Part of
the expense of occupying and administering the colonies militarily was the
suppression of local insurrections. Wars were fought against Raisouli and
Abd el-Hiba in Morocco and the Islamic Sensoussists in Tunisia at the end
of World War I, against Abd el-Krim again in Morocco in 1925, and in
Indochina in 1931. Considering Stein's presence in France during most of
these events, her silence concerning them is problematic in light of her
criticism of the German empire in <I>Paris France;</I> empire as such is
criticized not as imperialist hegemony but because the Germans manage it
to the detriment of their national art as collectible commodity:

That is the state of a nation when there is no art that is natural to that

In his radio address of 10 October 1940, P&eacute;tain tells theFrench
that they had the impression of being the citizens of a free state
by voting every four years. He insists however that the Third Republic was
enslaved on the one hand to economic interests and on the other hand to
the political parties and the unions: "Subjugated in different ways:
successively and sometimes simultaneously by coalitions of economic
interests and by political groups or unions fallaciously pretending to
represent the working class" ("Asservi de diverses mani&egrave;res:

Robert Paxton points to the mythical quality of the legend
thatP&eacute;tain rescued France with the armistice and the ensuing Vichy
government. Paxton maintains that the French, traumatized by the futility
of the trench war experience of World War I and comparably poorly armed
against Germany in 1940, had only "chaos itself as the ultimate weapon,"
which they refused to use. Like Stein, he reads the armistice as a
positive choice:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In truth, there was rather an instinctive shrinking from chaos that made
war to the end against Germany simply unthinkable. The final weapon of a
people whose conventional army has disintegrated is chaos. ting on
from abroad would mean not only the agonies of total occupation for
mainland France. . . . It also meant accepting reprisals upon mainland
Frenchmen for acts of war committed by other Frenchmen overseas. It meant
guerrilla warfare on the mainland, the conscious provocation of disorder,
the replacement of established administration by vigilantes, and a
deliberate policy of making the occupation costlier for everyone. [Robert

<I>Our America</I> and Nativist Modernism: A Panel
<!--_/title-->
</H2>
<hr>
<!--_text-->

<P>
<I>Now and then a critical book appears that attempts to reorient an
entire field; the debates that surround such work are exciting, and
the stakes are high. Walter Benn Michaels's <B>Our America: Nativism,
Modernism, and Pluralism </B>is just such a book. He makes three
important arguments with stunning lucidity: that American literature
of the 1920s followed closely the popular reactions against increased
immigration in the first two decades of the century; that American
modernism was driven by considerations of race and identity more than
of form and representation; that the identitarian and racist views of
culture that developed in the 1920s are the same as those advocated in
debates about identity in the 1990s. Whether one accepts these arguments
or not, Michaels has set new terms in which modern American literature
must be discussed.</I>

<P>
<I>Versions of the following papers were presented at a panel devoted
to this book that I organized for the American Comparative Literature
Association meeting at the University of Notre Dame in April 1996. I am
grateful to Charles Altieri, Walter Benn Michaels, and Marjorie Perloff
for agreeing to meet and argue with each other, and to Krzysztof Ziarek of
Notre Dame for giving us the ACLA forum. A number of people contributed
questions and comments to the debate we started there, and I would like
to thank them for that. I wish that I had found an editorial means
for presenting their remarks here. We've decided instead to present
more formal, extended versions of the comments made at Notre Dame in
the spring.</I>

<P>
I want to return to Marjorie Perloff's point about Michaels's terminology
and periodization, in order to confirm her claim that the scope of <I>Our
America</I> is less comprehensive than its subtitle suggests. The term in
dispute is of course modernism, which is conventionally distinguished from
a good deal of writing, painting, and music produced by twentieth-century
artists. Modernism indicates some affiliation by resemblance or avowal
across the generic boundaries of music, painting, and literature, or even
intellectual disciplines like physics, philosophy, psychology, and
sociology between the years--in Anglo-American academic literary
history--1909, taking the first Futurist manifesto as the starting point,
and maybe 1930 or a little later.

<P>
Michaels's nativist modernism is much more nativist than modernist: the
connections of his authors to international trends in other arts or areas
of expression are faint (William Carlos Williams and Langston Hughes are
the exceptions). One reason this matters is that terms like modernism and
romanticism are reserved for especially comprehensive historical trends,
such as seem in motion when artists or thinkers in diverse media begin to
collaborate. Michaels's subject is a distinct range of modern writing more
than modernism. His period begins with the end of World War I and runs
through the 1920s, which in literary-historical terms was a time of
fruition more than inception. Modernism in the English language peaked in
1922, when <I>The Waste Land</I> and <I>Ulysses</I> appeared, and 1923,
when William Carlos Williams's <I>Spring and All</I> was brought out at
his own expense, and Ezra Pound wrote the


<B></B>


Malatesta Cantos. A good
fourteen years of intellectual and especially artistic agitation and a
world war led to the peak of those years.

<P>
Michaels's nativist modernism is fearful of contact with the new
immigrants and even more of African Americans. The attraction to incest in
William Faulkner, and other authors, as Michaels shows, expresses just
this phobia. Michaels presents a strong case for a close fit between
literary and political history--Willa Cather's <I>The Professor's
House,</I> for instance, and the Immigration Act and the Indian
Citizenship Act of 1924 (<I>OA,</I> 30)--that serves our short-term
professional interests well. Do literary historians engage the issues that
determine the future of our America? Yes, certainly: the texts we teach
address just the issues that govern debate about political and social
policy. The long-term problem is exactly this reassuring fit. If literary
history fits social and political history too snugly, it becomes
redundant, after one has examined the history of legislation, say. Fear of
immigrants in Congress, the courts, and then--small surprise--in novels
and poems too.

<P>
Literary history is better justified just where it records some deviance
from social, political, and institutional history. The deviance I have in
mind is visible when writers dream of a different country than the one to
which they are born. Michaels loves to expose the nativist-modernist
folly--articulated by Calvin Coolidge--of becoming what you already are.
But I think of Ernst Bloch's courageous advocacy of French surrealism in
<I>Heritage of Our Times</I>  just when Germany was enforcing Nazi
conformity;
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 his claim, taken up by Fredric Jameson in <I>The
Political Unconscious,</I> is that literary texts rightly desire a
different world. Bloch wrote in 1918 that the "spirit of utopia exists in
the ultimate predicate of all great expressions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 That is the
revolutionary dimension of artistic expression. Michaels excavates a
spirit of realism and conformity instead, or a neat fit between political
history and artistic expression.

<P>
My point can be felt more concretely in the case of William Carlos
Williams. Michaels rightly shows how Williams enthusiastically expresses
Coolidge's impulse to become more American, but Williams's deviant
imagination of rape and miscegenation complicates this picture. <I>Spring
and All</I>  is about violation, though significantly not incestuous
violation. The core myth there is that of the abduction of Persephone, the
crossing of virginal purity with hellish alterity. Remember too that
P&egrave;re Rasles, the male hero of <I>In the American Grain</I> ,
is distinguished by his will "TO MARRY . . . to hybridize, to
crosspollenize" with the North American continent and its Indian
inhabitants; Jacataqua, a female hero of the book, is distinguished as a
leader by "her mixed French and Indian blood."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Her power and
articulateness comes not from being one of a tribe of Indians (the rest of
her tribe seems not to speak or act), but from being both European and
Indian. Hybridity meant the invention of new subjects, of new life forms.
Michaels's account of the many white writers who romanticized simply
becoming Indians is only one part of the imaginative life of the time.

<P>
Williams, Marianne Moore (as David Kadlec has shown), and Pound were all
fascinated by exogamy, hybridity, crossings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Pound fondly
remembered the brilliance of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska's conversation in
prewar London; "It might be exogamy,"


<B></B>


Pound said of the topics, "or
the habits of primitive tribes, . . . or aesthetics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
Pound's
account of the merits of literary translation is red in just these
terms: one literature needs the "cross" with its contrary, or other; this
is the life of literature. He himself set out from a suburb of
Philadelphia, where his parents did missionary social work with Italian
immigrants at the beginning of the century, to begin his literary career
in Venice. When he got to London he spent years hammering at British
insularity, insisting above all that the English recognize their need for
southern Mediterranean literary culture. When he returned to America in
1912, uncertain whether his literary future lay in the States or Europe,
this is what he described:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I see . . . a sign in the surging crowd on Seventh Avenue (New York). A
crowd pagan as ever imperial Rome was, eager, careless, with an animal
vigour unlike that of any European crowd that I have ever looked at. There
is none of the melancholy, the sullenness, the unhealth of the London
mass, none of the worn vivacity of Paris. I do not believe it is the
temper of Vienna.
<BR>
<BR>
One returns from Europe and one takes note of the size and vigour of
this new strange people. They are not Anglo-Saxon; their gods are not the
gods whom one was reared to reverence. And one wonders what they have to
do with lyric measures and the nature of "quantity."
<BR>
<BR>
One knows that they are the dominant people and that they are
against all delicate things.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It would require only a little archaeology on the first paragraph to show
that Pound's vision of the urban crowd derives from the
fin-de-si&egrave;cle European race discourse about degeneration. This new
strange people is a mongrel mass, as Pound sees it, and he admires it,
even while fearing its rude vitality. This is the prose of the Progressive
era, not Michaels's nativist-modernist period, and Michaels identifies a
greater flexibility about race among Progressive writers than among their
slightly later colleagues. Pound had only irony then for the American
interest "in being itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 He was, as Keith Tuma has shown,
very influenced by Progressive policy, but was he to just that extent not
a modernist?
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Are we to think of the poet-critic who developed
an immensely influential program for literary translation, related closely
to this passage from <I>Patria Mia,</I> as simply working out the
consequences in the 1920s of Progressive thought?

<P>
This is the moment to question the aptness of literary history positing a
divide at 1918, as American political historians do, rather than at 1914,
as American and European cultural historians commonly do. The difference
in periodization here is short, in historical terms, but significant.
Michaels's nativist modernism begins after World War I, which is to say
after intellectuals had been forced to abandon dreams of a comprehensive
European culture based on a confederation of European states--another
Enlightenment. The surrender of that hope is just what enables Perloff and
many cultural historians to distinguish the enthusiasm and radicalism of
the <I>avant guerre</I> from the grimmer years that interest Michaels.

<P>
Michaels argues cogently that "America would mean something different in
1925 from what it had meant at, say, the turn of the century; indeed, the
very idea of


<B></B>


national identity would be altered" (<I>OA,</I> 2). His
further claim is that international modernists such as Pound and T. S.
Eliot were more of the old world than of the new, because they never saw
the work that the concept of race would come to perform. My point then is
that stay-at-home modernists like Williams and Moore, as well as
international modernists like Pound and Eliot, saw the need to become not
just what you already are but in fact something entirely new: namely,
hybrids. How wonderful, really, that just when legislators were promoting
exclusive immigration policies, some writers were exploiting not just that
impulse, as Michaels shows, but its contrary too. That, I think, begins to
look like a literary history that recovers some of the richness of an
intellectual life worth living.

<P>
The issue of literary evaluation arises when one examines an understanding
of American modernism that does not accommodate Pound, Eliot, or Moore.
Michaels was recently asked by a student why we should admire or even care
about his nativist-modernist authors who apparently excelled at
constructing rationalizations for Negrophobic racism. <I>Our America</I>
suggests that Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cather, and others are
considerable authors exactly because they engaged meaningfully with the
ideas and crises of their moment. This is an evaluative argument
altogether familiar to readers of nineteenth-century criticism and social
thought: literature is considerable because it takes up the live thought
of its moment. Authors who labor with the senescent thought of their
predecessors are by this account less considerable. For example, Henry
James's preoccupation with class difference just when race was displacing
class as a principle of social differentiation left him seeming
pass&eacute; or, in Michaels's words, "insufficiently alert to racism's
potential as a technology of social organization" (<I>OA,</I> 56-57).
James missed an opportunity to reinvent the social thought of his time.
When Michaels speaks of the dissociation of race and culture, he is
analyzing a step in the development of political thought or culture in
America. His writers shaped that thought. However racist this thought was,
it was not stupid, as he shows; Michaels's method so vigorously explicates
the <I>reasons</I> behind this or that statement--

<P>

<P>
--that it is not surprising that he implicitly esteems logic and
effectively arrayed reasons, even when they entail ugly consequences.

<P>
Those authors whose texts were not efficiently governed by reasons and
rationales--Gertrude Stein and Moore, but poets generally, come to
mind--cannot fare well by this evaluative criterion. Another way of
putting this is to say that Michaels's method of analysis depends on quite
familiar modes of representation. The account


<B></B>


of modernism that he
intends to displace--viz., that modernism derived from a crisis in
representation--cannot be fully met by Michaels's method of paraphrase and
logical analysis. Stein's <I>Tender Buttons</I> , for instance, is
not adequately engaged (nor does Michaels try) by analyzing this or that
premise about national identity that may surface occasionally; nor can the
author of <I>Kora in Hell</I>  and <I>Spring and All</I> be
adequately engaged by a critical method that deals comfortably with the
pseudophilosophy of the posthumous <I>Embodiment of Knowledge</I> but
rather avoids the complicating illogic and excess of his poems and
expressionist prose. There is an important connection between Williams's
imaginative attraction to hybridity and extreme exogamy--as in rape by
numerous strangers
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
--and his belief that new poetic forms are
"additions to nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Michaels's method does not attend
closely to poetic form, let alone allow for it as a source of knowledge or
innovation.

<P>
What, then, is a just assessment of Michaels's nativist modernism? Well,
the more cosmopolitan modernism of James, Pound, Eliot, and Moore seems
actually reinvigorated by this acute examination of their successors who
made a too compliant peace with the ideas and even the laws of their time.
Nativist modernism, 1918-29, appears a distinct and dishonorable (if
not unique) chapter in the history of the Anglo-American and European
international movement in the arts known as modernism. Michaels has fully
demonstrated the need to subdivide the historical category of American
modernism in order to accommodate his nativist modernism, but it will not
do to let his term substitute for the more comprehensive term, or to
overlook the dialectic within his own period between the writers drawn to
utopian exogamy and those who imagined instead the purity of endogamy.
This dialectic is familiar to scholars of international
modernism--Marinetti's swarthy nurse and Mafarka's male
parthenogenesis
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
--and it is part of American literature too.
The endogamous impulse of Michaels's nativist modernists, such as
Faulkner, should be understood in relation to  the exogamous impulse of
"earlier" writers, such as Pound;  the exogamous impulses of other
writers of the same period, such as Moore; and  the exogamous impulses
of these same nativist modernists, because such a writer as Williams
seemed to feel the pull in both directions. The writers who did not see
the work to be done by the dissociation of race and culture seem to
Michaels to have fallen out of step with the onward march of mind. They
held instead to another vestige of the Enlightenment: the notion that
making oneself a citizen of the world or at least a European was an
ambitious and better project than making one what one already was, i. e.,
American. Given Michaels's persuasive critique of 1990s identitarian
cultural politics, it is puzzling that he underestimates the utopian
interest in exogamy and miscegenation in the larger modernist era. He
seems to esteem more highly the engag&eacute; project that he explicates
so brilliantly but also condemns.
