<p id="lead">Having been the only essay primarily devoted to the visual arts, my paper was something of an outlier. Nonetheless, the conversation came around a few times to Dalí's practice and more generally to the question of how to integrate historical accounts of the literary and the visual. The paper that follows does not attempt this difficult work, but it seems to me that a place to begin is with an evaluation of the determinative properties of canonization. In the seminar, I proposed that, despite the evident reality of multiple modernisms within the visual arts, there nevertheless unquestionably existed a hegemonic mainstream of modernist production that no historical revision can decenter without, in the end, fundamentally misrepresenting the events as they occurred. That this hegemonic mainstream exerted a centripetal force on the plurality of contemporaneous practices suggests that alternative modernisms are best understood as having developed dialogically—in direct or oblique relation to the mainstream. One wonders then whether or not the same is true of literary modernisms. To put the question another way: if it can be said that visual modernisms are "arboreal" (to use Deleuze's terminology), might it be the case that literary modernisms are by contrast "rhizomatic"? I don't have an answer to this, but framing the question in this manner may go some way toward clarifying what we mean when we speak of "multiple modernisms." And this, in turn, may help to shed light on the question of modernist authenticity, for the extent to which the question of authenticity can be said to preoccupy the mainstream of modernism is, I would argue, a question that must be answered at the outset. It was clear from a number of the papers that, within the diversity of experiences we call "modernity," experiences of <i>inauthenticity</i> 

<b></b>

 were both widespread and profound, and that diverse practices were developed to counter such experiences. Implicit, therefore, is the notion that modern life was shot through with things that seemed in one way or another inauthentic—deceptive, fake, superficial, ersatz. For me, the fact that this would be so remains a question in need of more precise answers. The essay that follows aims to be a step in that direction. </p>

<p>When André Breton first saw Salvador Dalí's paintings, he was by his own admission awestruck: "With the coming of Dalí, it is perhaps the first time that the mental windows have been opened really wide . . . "<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  With these words, written in 1929 to accompany Dalí's first exhibition in Paris, the founder, promoter, poet and principal theoretician of the Surrealist movement was throwing all his weight behind Dalí, in the hope that his paintings (and his charismatic presence) would breathe new life into Surrealism, which at this point—five years past its first stirrings—was beginning to show some age.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  There was one painting, however, about which Breton was less enthusiastic. <i>The Lugubrious Game</i>  depicts a strange and mesmerizing collection of objects, some painted with meticulous attention to detail, others cut from newsprint and affixed to the surface with equal meticulousness (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). What disturbed the poet was the male re in the foreground—more precisely, the stain that appeared on his pants, a brown stain that runs like melted chocolate past the man's shorts and onto his right leg. Breton was known by his friends to have had a profound and apparently unshakable distaste for anything even vaguely scatological, and this small but extravagant rendering was altogether too much for him to bear. As Dalí recalled some years later (after their friendship had soured), "I was obliged to justify myself by saying that it was merely a simulacrum. No further questions were asked."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  </p>

<p>What are we to make of this incident? For most, it's an event hardly worth mentioning—indicative only of Dalí's considerable skill at handling those around him whose critical support he understood as useful in advancing his career.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  But I wonder. Isn't it possible that Dalí in fact meant what he said? Isn't it possible that he believed that what he had painted was not a man with shit on his pants, but rather a man with a <i>simulacrum</i> of shit on his pants? Puzzling as that seems (it's a painting after all and thus a simulacrum in its entirety), there is, in fact, reason to take this notion seriously.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Dali's recollection of this encounter may well have been tainted with bad will toward Breton (Breton had, after all, taken to referring to the painter by the name "Avida Dollars"), but it is also true that while Dali was working on this painting, he was undeniably fascinated with the concept of the fake. His 1930 poem, <i>The Great Masturbator</i>, for example, makes reference to a host of fake things: "fake gold," "fake bronze," "fake bricks," and yes, "fake shit," too (in fact, the poem makes a point of distinguishing this fake shit from "real shit").<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Indeed, Dali's understanding of the unconscious was itself understood through the lens of the illusory and the fake. Memories, he contended, were like jewels in that "it is always the false ones that look . . . the most brilliant."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  

<b></b> 

 One would thus be justified in suggesting that Dalí's reply to Breton's outrage was, if strategic, nonetheless substantive. </p>

<p>One of the few lacunae in the vast scholarship on Dalí is the painter's fascination with fakes. Although this is not the place to undertake a full account of it, this fascination developed out of an interest in surfaces on the one hand and the illusionistic potential of painting on the other. A close examination of Dalí's writings shows that fakes, simulacra,  

<b></b>

 surfaces, illusions are just as much the subject of Dalí's paintings as are rotting animals, giant insects, and desolate landscapes. And yet these elements were invisible to Breton (who only wanted to be assured that Dalí was not in fact coprophilic) as well as others who saw (and still see) Dali's paintings only as illustrations of fantasies, dreams, perversions and unconscious obsessions. </p>

<p>This raises the question of why Dali's interest in illusions, copies, and fakes failed to register, even with those most intimately engaged with his work. And one might ask as well: is Dalí's interest in illusions, copies, and fakes indicative only of his personality (a mind capable of being thrown "open really wide"), or is it also, perhaps, indicative of modern experience in general? In other words, to what extent can it be said that Dalí's interest is tied to experiences in which one finds oneself interacting with (or worrying that one might interact with) things that are not real, but are instead illusory or otherwise inauthentic? The answer, I would suggest, involves his deliberate rejection of modernist techniques in favor of a reactionary return to the techniques of the Old Masters. </p>

<p>What was it about the paintings of the Old Masters that the moderns found most objectionable? On the surface, it was simply that they were old—out of date and incompatible with modern life. More substantially, it was that they were perceived as having focused only on the surface of things, the outer skin. They failed to register the inner reality of the world, the hidden truth. The problem, in other words, was that Old Master paintings were, in a certain fundamental sense, superficial. And the solution—according to a vast array of artists and critics—was to develop a pictorial practice that would reach below the surface of things, a practice that would therefore count as more profound. The evidence of this ambition is multiple, and beyond the scope of this essay. One example will have to suffice: "The true purpose of painting," wrote the critic Jacques Rivière in 1912, "is to represent objects as they really are; that is to say, differently from the way we see them. It tends always to give us their sensible <i>essence</i>, their presence; this is why the image it forms does not resemble their <i>appearance</i> . . . "<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The understanding of modernism as hostile to superficial appearances and thus aimed at unveiling an inner essence has been recently elaborated upon by the philosopher Alain Badiou, who argues that the guiding ambitions of twentieth-century art and culture are animated by what he calls "la passion du réel"—which is to say a deep-seated, irrational impulse to destroy any and all conventions in the name of direct, unmediated experience.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Badiou's assessment of twentieth-century culture has drawn considerable attention, but it actually continues a line of analysis that has been developing since the 1960s and 1970s—by people like Henri Peyre, Geoffrey Hartmann, and of course, Lionel Trilling, who argued in <i>Sincerity and Authenticity</i> that, from the early modern period, 

<b></b>

 the question of how to see beneath the surface of things so as to discern the genuine from the fake, the sincere from the phony, was among the most salient features of art and literature, and indeed of social life in general.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Trilling attributes the modern fixation on authenticity as bound to a pervasive fear of deception, which he explains (albeit cursorily) as having resulted from fundamental changes within the social sphere of modern life—above all, the decline of feudalism, and with it the rise of social and economic mobility in the modern city.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Writing at the turn of the century, Georg Simmel attributed the modern anxiety about deception to the peculiar conditions of urban experience. Simmel claimed that by virtue of its grand scale and its enormous population—too large to know intimately—the city was a place where interpersonal suspicion becomes, by necessity, a normal feature of everyday life.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Simmel also noted that the modern city alters not only one's relation to people but also one's relation to things. The spectacle of commodities on view in trade exhibitions and department stores fostered the intensification of what Simmel called "the shop-window quality of things"—that quality of a commodity that is distinct from both its use-value and exchange-value. The shop-window quality of an object (its display-value, as it were) is determined exclusively by its appearance. "Where competition no longer operates in matters of usefulness and intrinsic properties, the interest of the buyer has to be aroused by the external stimulus of the object, even the manner of its presentation."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  With emphasis shifted from "intrinsic properties" to "external stimulus," it is easy to understand how the threat of deception—as in interpersonal exchange—becomes an urban problematic.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  It's worth remembering that with the rise of the city comes the rise of the detective novel, in which the heroic re is no longer necessarily capable of great physical feats. Instead, his ability to compel our awe and fascination comes from his deductive ability, his ability to see through people and things to reveal what's hidden underneath.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Simmel's work suggests that in the modern city there was an imperative for everyone to become a kind of detective, constantly alert to the possibility that one was on the verge of being ripped off—and, furthermore, that modernism as Rivière and others articulated it was driven by a common anxiety that the world was shot through with deception.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The modernist rejection of the techniques of the Old Masters thus can be seen as a concerted, if not altogether desperate, attempt to ward off self-deception while at the same time producing a work of art that would manifest itself as having nothing to hide.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In a text that dates from 1900, the philosopher Henri Bergson makes a claim about human consciousness and the imperative of the modern artist that seems to me to encapsulate this dynamic:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Between nature and ourselves . . . a veil is interposed: a veil that is dense and opaque for the common herd,—thin, almost transparent, for the artist and the poet . . . So art, whether it be painting or sculpture, poetry or music, has no other object than to brush aside the utilitarian symbols, the conventional and socially accepted generalities, in short, everything that veils reality from us, in order to bring us face to face with reality itself.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> <b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">

 With this, Bergson offered up modern art as bound to the ambition to strip away the superficial "veil" of appearance so as to arrive at something that deserved to be called authentic experience—an experience that was to be understood as standing outside all social conventions and artificial systems of organizing knowledge. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>What does this have to do with Dalí? What is the relationship between Dalí's antimodernist embrace of Old Master techniques on the one hand and Badiou's "passion of the real," or Bergson's "reality itself" on the other? The answer, I believe, lies in Dalí's fascination with superficiality, illusions and fakes. In 1927, Dalí wrote to his friend, the poet Federico Garcia Lorca: "I am superficial and the outside of things is what delights me, for in the last analysis the outside of things is that which is objective."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In an essay published that same year, Dalí sounded a similar note, recalling Simmel's window-shopper: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Oh marvelous mechanical industrial world! . . . Magnificent invitations to the senses and to the voyage of discovery of unknown objects, the gray rubber of tires, the clear glass of windshields, the soft tones of enchanting filter-tipped cigarettes the color of lips, golf bag [sic], marmalades of all colors, pastries of delightful qualities . . . perfect products, the eurythmic play of curves; alterations of diverse qualities, <i>smooth surfaces, rough surfaces, polished surfaces, speckled surfaces</i> . . . "<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Unlike the detective, Dalí expresses no interest in determining whether or not he's being deceived. What interests him are the surfaces of things, not their insides. What he loves is not so much the things of modernity (their "intrinsic properties" as Simmel put it), but the way modern things look (their "external stimulus"). He has no concern at all about Bergson's veil; indeed, it seems that for him the world might just as well be one enormous veil. Here is the conclusion I draw from this: Dalí's rejection of modernist techniques in favor of a return to those of the Old Masters is an effort, at least in part, to replace depth with surface, authenticity with artifice. In the 1920s, while Dalí was vacillating between modernist and traditional techniques, his thoughts were scattered and inconsistent, and his intention is visible only in piecemeal fashion. But in 1930, he worked to formulate this concept cogently, in an essay entitled "The Sanitary Goat."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This was published together with three others in a small book entitled <i>The Visible Woman</i>. Of these four texts, "The Sanitary Goat" has received the least scholarly attention, probably because it doesn't help much with the struggle to understand Dalí's imagery. But when it comes to making sense of <i>how</i> Dalí painted, it is, in my opinion, among his most important aesthetic statements. </p>

<p>The text begins with a critique of modern art at large, which, says Dali, is infected by what he calls a "lingering impressionism" ("SG," 226). He attributes this lingering impressionism directly to Bergson, whose error, claims Dalí, is to respond to the threat of deception by shrinking back, by turning inward toward the immediate data of the 

<b></b>

 senses. This, Dali claims, merely concedes the problem without solving it, for if the question is the reality of one's experience, then it solves nothing to focus only on the "impressions" that this reality makes. For Dalí, the only legitimate response to the threat of deception is to embrace illusion itself, to celebrate the superficial world of images, and in doing so, put an end to the Bergsonian ambition altogether. </p>

<p>For Dalí, it is toward the realm of the simulacrum—the illusory image—that painters ought to turn their attention.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  There is a point, he claims, where reality and its representation start to pull away from each other—a point where a picture no longer serves to represent the world, but rather makes its own world. In "The Sanitary Goat," he calls this the "gratuitous point," because it is at this point that an image becomes gratuitous—it no longer serves its original representational function and instead acts according to its own internal dynamic.  </p>

<p>Dalí's analysis here is far from straightforward, and is best understood by turning to his principal example: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[A] gratuitous point . . . might take shape in the gesture, generally taken to be erratic, of a person who, without knowing how to play the piano, imitates (perfectly) on a marble table the confident fingering of a true pianist, convinced of the absolute similarity of his imitation . . . This point . . . would materialize precisely at the moment when the fake pianist would lose for a moment his absolute faith in his imitation, but would continue with it nonetheless with no less enthusiasm.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
("SG," 229)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">It should be emphasized that there is nothing "surrealist" about the imagery evoked here; there is nothing irrational or dreamlike about a person pretending to play the piano. What Dalí wants us to recognize is that the apparently banal act of pretending to play is itself potentially both strange and disorienting. </p>

<p>Dalí makes no direct connection in "The Sanitary Goat" between the concept of the "gratuitous point" and the paintings that he was at the time completing (paintings such as <i>The Lugubrious Game</i>), but it nonetheless suggests a way to approach them. It suggests, in other words, that we think about these paintings as "gratuitous points"—that is, as representations that have at some point detached themselves from the world of reality to which they had once been connected (or at least seemed to be connected to—remember that the fake pianist only believed himself to be mimicking the gestures of a real pianist). </p>

<p>Although Dalí's paintings are typically understood as having abandoned the traditional task of representing visible, outer reality for the sake of depicting the invisible, inner reality of the unconscious, this is not at all what Dalí himself indicates. If we are to interpret paintings like <i>The Lugubrious Game </i>according to the example he gives here, then they are not to be understood as faithful representations of the dream-world. In fact, they should be seen as altogether unfaithful representations—that is, as fakes. To see Dalí's work in this way requires a significant shift in perspective. It demands that we take seriously not only <i>what</i> Dalí painted, but also, and perhaps more importantly, <i>how</i> he painted. In other words, when Dalí flippantly deflected Breton's outrage by referring to his painting as "a mere simulacrum," he was, in a paradoxical way, telling him the truth.<b></b> </p>

While it is unclear whether Stark is here referring to all painting, or only painting before Manet, he later suggests—in ways which chime with my account here—that modernist painting (after Manet) is aimed at countering the pervasive deceptiveness of modern life: "Against the overwhelming inauthenticity of modern life, the painter opposes an experience that makes the real visible." </p>

<p><a name="FOOT17" href="#REF17">17</a>. John Paul Riquelme argues in his essay for a more dialectical account of modernist practice in which authenticity is critiqued in an effort to produce "a potentially self-correcting dynamic" which he defines as "a negative moment of corrective rejection followed by a further different kind of negativity that recognizes the corrective rejection's inevitable eventual lapse into bad faith (or ideological delusion, or inauthenticity)." While I do not disagree with Riquelme that such dialectical responses have played a role within modernism, my concern here lies with an artist who seems to me to confront the consequences of what Riquelme refers to as "the eventual lapse into . . . inauthenticity." </p>

<p><a name="FOOT22" href="#REF22">22</a>. During the seminar conversation, Riquelme suggested that, if we wish to develop an account of modernism's truck with the artificial and inauthentic, discussion really ought begin with Oscar Wilde. To what extent, he asked, has the historical marginalization of Wilde made modernism appear more uniformly opposed to inauthenticity than it might in fact be? Riquelme's question strikes me as especially pertinent, for it points toward the need to begin to account more fully for the practices of res such as Dalí and Wilde—res for whom the confusion between the real and the fake is understood not as a threat (or not merely as a threat), but as an opportunity. How are we to understand these practices in relation to the mainstream of modernism—a mainstream that, as Trilling, Badiou, and indeed this very seminar has made clear, aspired above all to the experience of authenticity?</p>
