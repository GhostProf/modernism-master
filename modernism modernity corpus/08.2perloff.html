In a sketchbook for 1964, Jasper Johns began to make notes for
his paintings <I>Watchman</I> and <I>According to What.</I> On one
particularly tantalizing page, he makes a sketch for what would appear
in both paintings as the wax cast of a man's lower torso, positioned on
the seat of a chair, itself bisected vertically to accommodate the depth
of the fragmented re (<A HREF="8.2perloff_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Torso and chair are inverted so that the long left leg extends upward
  to meet the word "spy" at the lower margin of the enigmatic text,
  positioned as a reversed L-shape above it:

In the square inside the L-shaped text, Johns has written: "Somewhere
here, there is the / question of "seeing clearly." / Seeing
<I>what</I>? <I>According to what?</I>"

What or who are watchman and spy? "If the artist is the spy (never
depicted)," writes Francis M. Naumann in a 1992 catalogue essay,
"the watchman is the spectator/critic, a member of the viewing
audience. In his capacity as a spectator, the watchman remains momentarily
inactive--seated--his disoriented position and fragmentation suggesting
that he has, as Johns has predicted, fallen into 'the trap of looking.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  And Michael Crichton takes the distinction even more literally, "The
  notes suggest that this is a picture about looking. They identify the
  cast of the leg and chair, inverted in one corner; that is the watchman
  (falling into the trap of looking?)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 But why would Johns, who always resisted allegorical readings of his
 work, refer to the "spectator/critic" as a mysterious watchman in
 seemingly endless struggle with an equally mysterious artist-spy? And
 why, to make matters murkier, would he use an encaustic cast of a leg,
 unconnected to a body, as a representation of something as specific
 as this "watchman"? A few pages earlier in Johns's sketchbook where
 the cast of the leg (not yet inverted) is outlined in the upper right,
 next to a hinge picture, we read:

"Avoid a polar / situation": Johns always preferred the "traffic" at
the "edge of the city"--a border situation--to binaries like artist/spy
and spectator/watchman. In his Watchman note, an arrow points from the
enigmatic phrase "'Looking' is &amp; is not 'eating' &amp; also 'being
eaten,'" to the parenthetical comment "Cezanne?--Each object reflecting
the other" (<I>WSI</I> 59). The reference is probably to Gertrude Stein's
observation that "C&eacute;zanne conceived the idea that in composition
one thing was as important as another thing. Each part is as important
as the whole."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  For Johns, as for Stein, composition must be decentered,
  nonhierarchical, each part of the canvas as important as every other
  part.

Thus, unlike, say, Jackson Pollock's all-over drip paintings of the
preceding decade--paintings that, however improvisatory their process of
composition might have been, are characterized, in the words of Johns's
friend Frank O'Hara, by their formal "balance, proportion, and controlled
emotion"--<I>Watchman</I> (<A HREF="8.2perloff_3.html"> 3</A>
and front cover)

  What, for example, is the relation of the three-dimensional body cast
  (the inverted leg), attached to the chair to the wooden ball and
  stick at bottom left? How do both these "real" objects relate to the
  three horizontal brownish-grayish "abstract" sections of the canvas,
  bearing the partially hidden words "RED," "YELLOW," and "BLUE" (only
  their first letters are visible)--words that, confusingly, match not
  the color fields in which they appear, but the three rectangles on the
  right, as if to suggest that observation alone is never sufficient for
  understanding. When I look at <I>Watchman,</I> my eye moves down from
  the disturbing encaustic leg-cast to focus on the wide orange, white,
  and green brushstrokes that seem to replace the cast's missing upper
  torso, brushstrokes that don't blend, thus emphasizing the flatness of
  the canvas. As they cascade downward, they lose their color, giving way
  to a thin gray-brown wash dripping across a partially hidden newspaper
  page to the strip at the bottom, evidently made by dragging the stick
  at the left across the canvas through a layer of wet paint, leaving
  a black-through-white tonal scale covered with drips behind.

In studying the incongruous objects incorporated into Johns's
paintings of the early sixties--for example, the two letters
N and O, cut out of aluminum foil and suspended from a wire in
<I>NO,</I> the ruler and tin cup in <I>Good Time Charley</I> (<A
HREF="8.2perloff_4.html"> 4</A>), the broom, china cup, and
towel in <I>Fool's House</I>--Leo Steinberg comments that for Johns,
the canvas is "not a picture plane, not a window, nor an uprighted
tray, nor yet an object with active projections into actual space;
but a surface observed during impregnation, observed as it receives a
message or imprint from real space."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  In <I>Watchman,</I> the little wooden ball against which a stick leans
  diagonally is just such an imprint, a trace of impregnation that alters
  the surface. But what is the message and who is the spy?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Johns's own comments only compound the mystery. Interviewed by Yoshiaki
Tono in August 1964, after the completion of the painting, he explains
that "The idea for this work first occurred to me two years ago, when
I visited Madame Tussaud's, in London. The image of flesh, the image
of skin--images I had never used before. . . . The idea of the leg of
a person sitting on a chair came to me about a year ago" (<I>WSI</I>
96). As for the verbal account of watchman and spy, Johns dismisses it as
a "play on words." "I don't," he tells Tono, "want you to associate the
essay with the picture" (<I>WSI</I> 96-7). When the latter presses,
remarking that the poet Shin Ooka took the painting to refer to "the trace
of something that had abruptly passed away . . . the end of a drama,"
Johns replies, "For me the picture implies the fall of something, an
interpretation I think is clear from the leg's position in the overall
composition." But lest we start reading the image allegorically as
a fall from innocence or grace or as a wartime execution, he adds
matter-of-factly: "The leg will naturally fall . . . if you cut the
support that attaches the chair to the canvas" (<I>WSI</I> 97). And in
an allusion to Wittgenstein, whose <I>Philosophical Investigations</I>
Johns had been reading with absorption since 1962, he emphasizes his
concern for the context within which meanings are made.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 He writes:

For instance, there is the word "red." But what is "red" out of many
shades of red, or which "red" is the real red, this red or that red? When
we gradually add yellow, exactly how much yellow will turn "red" into
"orange"? I find this way of seeing things very interesting. If you take
up something, for instance, and you name it "something," then

<B></B>

you and I can understand exactly what the other party means through this
naming. This is useful and necessary in our daily life. If we come closer
and closer to that "something" to identify it, however, we will begin
to wonder whether that "something" is really "something" or not. [Ibid.]

Precision coupled with a respect for <I>difference,</I> Johns insists, is
by no means equivalent to the materialism or objecthood practiced by Pop

Here again is a reference to "looking and seeing" (watchman and spy?),
this time in contradistinction to an art of "patriotism or politics."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This seeming political disengagement has been defined, in a much discussed
essay by Moira Roth, as the "aesthetic of indifference."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  The Duchamp-Cunningham-Cage-Rauschenberg-Johns circle, she argues,
  responded to the oppressive Cold War climate of the fifties
  and sixties by adopting a stance of neutrality, passivity,
  and negation. Rauschenberg's <I>White Paintings,</I> Cage's
  <I>Lecture on Nothing</I> and notorious piano piece <I>4'33",</I>
  and Johns's "monotonous" and "repetitious" <I>Alphabets</I> and
  <I>Numbers</I>--these, she argues, contain "no messages, no feelings
  and no ideas. Only emptiness" (<I>D/I</I> 41). Indeed, she writes,
  the work of the Johns circle testifies to

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the bizarre disjunction of art and politics that emerged in the 1960s. The
radical political movements of the 1960s had virtually no expression in
the art of that time, an art that was strangely appealing and acceptable
to the very forces--governmental, corporate and middle-class powers--that
these radical movements opposed. [<I>D/I</I> 35]

Here Roth is referring to the role that the State Department and CIA
have been shown to have played in the promotion and dissemination of New
York painting--especially abstract expressionism--in the late forties
and fifties.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  But Johns, as a representative of the next generation and as the
  youngest member of the Cage-Cunningham circle (he was born in 1930),
  went, so she posits, beyond the legendary political indifference and
  negation she associates particularly with Duchamp:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
More than any other artist, Johns incorporated in his early art the Cold
War and the McCarthy era preoccupations and moods. This is not to imply
that Johns did this consciously or single-mindedly . . . but what emerges
out of a collective examination of his work is a dense concentration
of metaphors dealing with spying, conspiracy, secrecy and concealment,
misleading information, coded messages and clues. These were the very
subjects of newspaper headlines of the period, reiterated on the radio
and shown on television. . . . [Johns's] early work is a warehouse of
Cold War metaphors. [<I>D/I</I> 43]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The argument for a subliminal presence of Cold War spying/concealment
imagery in works like <I>Watchman</I> makes more sense than does
the identification of watchman with viewer, spy with artist. But as
Jonathan D. Katz points out in his provocative response to Roth's
piece, published together with hers in <I>Difference/Indifference</I>
, her essay (originally appearing in 1977) fails to account for
the role sexuality played in the artistic choices made by the artists
in question. Ironically, Roth herself referred to Cage, Johns, and
Cunningham as models of "a new breed of artist, an alternative to the

<B></B>

politically concerned abstract expressionists," and cites the sculptor
George Segal's description of the "new" artist as a "slender, cerebral,
philosophical, iconoclastic type," with "a dandylike elegance of body
build and a manner which delighted in cool and elegant plays of the
mind" (<I>D/I</I> 37). "Dandy" is of course a euphemism for gay, and she
acknowledged that the artists in question were predominantly homosexual
or, like Duchamp performing as Rrose S&eacute;lavy, bisexual. Katz, with
the hindsight of twenty years, adds that, given the extreme homophobia
of the postwar era, the "indifference" of the artists in question must be
understood less as "passivity" than as an expression of what he calls the
"double duty" of "camouflage <I>and</I> contestation" that characterized
"the compulsory Cold War closet" (<I>D/I</I> 51). "What Roth refers to
as 'an aesthetic of indifference,'" he writes, "can be more accurately
termed 'a politics of negation,' wherein negation functions as an active
resistance to hegemonic constructions of meaning as natural or inherent
in the work" (<I>D/I</I> 63). The performance of "silence" (or White
Painting), in this scheme of things, testifies to the awareness of the
possibilities of "a newly destabilized and de-essentialized construction
of self" (<I>D/I</I> 55). The "natural," always a mystification of the
social, is replaced by the dandy's "narcissistic pleasures of performative
fluency" (<I>D/I</I> 59).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This reminder of the role sexual orientation played in the negative
politics of the Cage circle is a useful antidote to Roth's overly
schematic distinction between a committed and an uncommitted poetry. But
Katz glosses over certain key differences among the artists <I>inside</I>
the circle in question. To understand the role of Johns's "cool" art in
the "activist" sixties, it is useful to read Johns's work against that of
a closely related gay artist, or rather poet (and art critic)--a poet who
was Johns's exact contemporary (born 1926) and, like him, a great admirer
of John Cage, whose <I>Music of Changes,</I> as performed by David Tudor,
he had introduced to a third poet-friend, John Ashbery, as early as 1952.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  I am thinking of course of Frank O'Hara, whose poetry stands behind a
  number of important Johns compositions and vice-versa. At the same time,
  O'Hara's aesthetic, rooted as it was in the fifties, was to prompt
  Johns's own radical rethinking, in the early sixties, of what art
  could be, an art in which the "memory of [one's] feelings" gradually
  gave way to the memory of one's prior works, of what Cage had called,
  in a brilliant meditative essay on Johns's work, "<I>structures, not
  subjects</I>" (<I>YM</I> 75, emphasis added). Cage, Johns, O'Hara:
  the trio makes for an interesting rethinking of Cold War "difference"
  and "indifference."

In 1961, as is often remarked, Johns's work changed dramatically. As
Kirk Varnedoe tells it:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
a new emotional tone intervened in Johns's work, chill, dark, and
bleak. Titles of negation, melancholy, or bitterness (<I>No, Liar,
In Memory of My Feelings--Frank O'Hara</I>) underlined this altered
mood. . . . Gray, formerly the guise of impassive neutrality, became
an expressive cast of gloom and morbidity. This was now an art under
pressure, and imagery

of imprinting and smearing, along with thinned-out passages of staining
paint and crusts of scraped residue, gave it a more troubled material

What had happened? In <I>Off the Wall,</I> Calvin Tomkins reports that
Johns's long-term relationship with Rauschenberg broke up in 1961:
"By the time the summer ended they were no longer together. The break
was bitter and excruciatingly painful, not only for them but for their
closest associates--Cage and Cunningham and a few others--who felt that
they, too, had lost something of great value."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Johns began spending a large part of the year in a house he had bought
  on Edisto Island, off the coast of South Carolina.

One of the first paintings made after the move to Edisto
was called <I>In Memory of My Feelings--Frank O'Hara</I> (<A
HREF="8.2perloff_5.html"> 5</A> and back cover). This is
not, as the title might suggest, an homage to a new lover; quite the
contrary. Johns and O'Hara had first met in 1957, but they were not
immediately friends, possibly because O'Hara's primary allegiance, in
his role as curator at the Museum of Modern Art, was to the abstract
expressionists: he was exhibiting (and writing on) Jackson Pollock
and Willem De Kooning, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, and Helen
Frankenthaler.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  Johns, for his part, remained aloof from these painters. Asked in
  a 1964 interview whether his "stylism" was "a logical step beyond
  abstract expressionism," he responded,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I tried to consciously avoid making statements that were already being
made well. The 1940s did something valuable with the work of Pollock and
others. In the 1950s there was a hangover where they were not producing
private [pictures] but painting public pictures and refining statements. I
am not interested in refinement. I try to avoid resemblances. [<I>WSI</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There was also the question raised by Moira Roth and Jonathan Katz about
the abstract expressionists' lifestyle: the loud and aggressively macho
Cedar Bar scene was no more congenial to Johns than it had been to Cage,
who recalls trying to avoid Jackson Pollock "because he was generally so
drunk, and he was actually an unpleasant person for me to encounter. I
remember seeing him on the same side of the street I was, and I would
always cross over to the other side."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 But despite such conflicting loyalties, by 1959 Frank and "Jap" were
 corresponding--O'Hara sent Johns a long, amusingly annotated list of
 books worth reading, both poetry and prose (<I>FOH</I> 15ff) and it is
 Jap who accompanies Frank to the Southampton weekend house party given
 by Kenneth and Janice Koch, where O'Hara and the dancer Vincent Warren
 become lovers, a weekend memorialized in the poem "Joe's Jacket":

Johns's hinged painting (<A HREF="8.2perloff_5.html">5</A>
is divided in half, but the two seemingly matching "halves" are
discordant. In the right half, the "abstract" brushstrokes--predominantly
black and blue with some white and a few color flecks of orange-red--don't
blend: theirs is, in Steinberg's words, a "ceaseless overlap-interlace
of re and ground; a paint surface like knitting or basketry. Not a
shallow space but the quickened density of a film." The "M-W brushstroke"
used here and in related paintings of the early sixties, "functions like
the corrugated staples carpenters use."

  out and drip onto the largely white area near the bottom. In the
  top half, the strokes are obliterated by a more smoothly painted
  brown-grey rectangle, reminiscent of Johns's earlier <I>Canvas</I>
  (<A HREF="8.2perloff_6.html"> 6</A>) and <I>Flags</I> (<A
  HREF="8.2perloff_7.html"> 7</A>). Suspended on a wire from
  a screw near the top of this rectangle is an ordinary silver spoon,
  oddly hung, not by its handle, but upside down, as is the fork whose
  prongs are just visible behind it. The fork's shadow, just to the right
  of the utensils, recalls a hand, with fingers closed. The well of the
  spoon intersects the bottom edge of the rectangle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we consider the function of the spoon and fork, we should note that
the lower edge of the canvas is unpainted, reminding us that painterly
illusionism is not in order. And right above this unpainted lower strip,
we read the stencilled letters of the painting's title "IN MEMORY OF
MY FEELINGS--FRANK O'HARA" and, to its right, the signature "J. JOHNS"
with the date "[19]61." This seeming authentication is misleading, for
the painting in no way "illustrates" O'Hara's poem, of which more in a
moment. Indeed, as Fred Orton puts it, <B></B>

the grey brushstrokes that dominate the right, and mark the white
ground and turpentine-like-brown greyness of the left canvas are
there not as the direct expression of feelings but as signifiers of
the expression of feelings appropriated from the pictorial language of
abstract expressionism. In the context of Johns's surface, they refer
to the idea of the unmediated association of feelings and facture, but
their very identity as appropriated signifiers inhibits our seeing and
understanding them as marks directly expressive of Johns's feelings.

Brushstroke thus becomes ironic allusion, a kind of distancing device
whereby overt emotion, whether the painter's own or that of the previous
New York generation, is kept at bay. The suspended spoon and fork
contribute to this sense of displacement. Orton speculates that Johns
had in mind O'Hara's poem "Dig My Grave with a Silver Spoon," and that
there is some private association between these little eating utensils
and death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 But perhaps the most important thing to note is that Johns strips
 ordinary domestic objects like spoons of their normal associations,
 recontextualizing them so as to "make it strange." Spoons and forks are
 to eat with, not suspended from wires like stick res in a game of
 Hang Man. Spoons and forks are to be held by someone, one in each hand,
 not bound together as they are here, where the fork oddly hides behind
 (or couples with?) the suspended, phallically erect spoon (<I>FOH</I>
 xxii). And finally, the juxtaposition of these ordinary, everyday objects
 with the bluish-gray paint surface is curiously disorienting, challenging
 the viewer's notions of how a visual field should be organized.

The blue-black brushstrokes play yet another role: they almost bury the
words "DEAD MAN" stenciled across the lower edge of both canvases: "D"
on the left, "EAD MA[N]" on the right, and then above that, but only on
the right canvas, again--this time in smaller letters--"DEAD MAN."

  The thick paint strokes, as Orton points out, "completely cover the
  human skull that Johns pictured, probably with a crude stencil of his
  own devising, in the top right of the canvas." The naked eye cannot
  make out this skull; Orton is presumably drawing on Johns's sketchbook
  for 1961, which contains a page, at whose top we read "A DEAD MAN"
  and right below it:

both cases, the skull also resembles a light bulb, thus recalling the

The reference to "DEAD MAN" appears curiously prophetic as O'Hara met
his own death five years later, when he was only forty, in a tragic
beach buggy accident at Fire Island. The commemorative volume published
by the Museum of Modern Art in 1967 again bore the title <I>In Memory
of My Feelings.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  But in 1961 O'Hara was very much alive, so the words "DEAD MAN" and
  the outline of the hidden skull must be construed otherwise. A hint is
  supplied in John Cage's collage essay "Jasper Johns: Stories and Ideas,"
  first published in the Jewish Museum catalog of the work of Johns early
  in 1964 and reprinted in <I>A Year From Monday</I> . In this text,
  in which the italicized passages are taken from Johns's own writings,
  Cage tries to recreate the artist's strange but highly disciplined ways
  of working and to define his aesthetic. Near the beginning, we read:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Beginning with a flag that has no space around it, that has the same
size as the painting, we see that it is not a painting <I>of</I> a
flag. The roles are reversed: beginning with the flag, a painting was
made. Beginning, that is, with structure. [<I>YM</I> 74]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But not just any structure: "If it comes to his notice that someone else
had one of his ideas before he did, he makes a mental or actual note not
to proceed with his plan" (ibid.). Here is the fear of "resemblances"
I talked of earlier, the need to See It New. And also the need to
differentiate Johns from his contemporaries: "if only," notes Cage,
discrimination "will make us pause long enough in our headstrong passage
through history to realize that Pop Art, if deducted from his work,
represents a misunderstanding, if embarked upon as the next step after
his, represents a non-sequitur" (<I>YM</I> 75). And we recall Johns's
own distinction between Pop Art's "dealing with images" and his own
"working for form" (<I>WSI</I> 92).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gay "concealment," it seems, can mean many different things: witness
the obsession with object and image of that other famous gay sixties
artist, Andy Warhol. For Johns, perhaps because of the rootlessness and
isolation of his childhood, subjectivity becomes a matter of endless
self-invention. In Cage's wonderfully dead-pan "bio" sketch:

He does not remember being born. His earliest memories concern living with
his grandparents in Allendale, South Carolina. Later, in the same town, he
lived with an aunt and uncle who had twins, a brother and sister. Then he
went back to live with his grandparents. After the third grade in school
he went to Columbia, which seemed like a big city, to live with his mother
and stepfather. A year later, school finished, he went to a community
on a lake called The Corner to stay with his Aunt Gladys. He thought
it was for the summer but stayed there for six years studying with his
aunt who taught all the grades in one room, a school called Climax. The
following year he finished high school living in Sumter with his mother
and stepfather, two half-sisters and his half-brother. He went to college
for a year and a half in Columbia where he lived alone. [<I>YM</I> 78]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
How do we interpret these "facts"? There is no simple answer. We may
surmise, if we like, that Johns must have been lonely and miserable. But
this would be to read normative values into the equivocal portrait,
whereas it might just be possible, in Johns's particular case, that the
absence of close family ties and a home produced a remark

<B></B>

able self-reliance and resilience. Then, too, as Cage implies, there is,
after all, one constant in the nomadic life described--namely, South
Carolina, represented, in the present of Cage's essay, by Edisto.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   A few pages later, Cage poses the question, "Does he live in the same
   terror and confusion that we do?" And he responds in Johns's own words,
   "<I>The air must move in as well as out--no sadness, just disaster</I>"
   (<I>YM</I> 80). This Buddhist note of acceptance (a faith Cage shares
   and hence writes about so movingly) culminates in the text's final
   paragraph, which refers to an afternoon of mushroom hunting in the
   local woods:

Even though in those Edisto woods you think you didn't get a tick or
ticks, you probably did. The best thing to do is back at the house to
take off your clothes, shaking them carefully over the bathtub. Then
make a conscientious self-examination with a mirror if necessary. It
would be silly too to stay out of the woods simply because the ticks are
in them. Think of the mushrooms (Caesar's among them!) that would have
been missed. Ticks removed, fresh clothes put on, something to drink,
something to eat, you revive. There's scrabble and now chess to play

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
O'Hara's long autobiographical poem was begun on his thirtieth birthday;
the immediate occasion may well have been the crisis of turning thirty
and fearing that his vocation might never be realized. Indeed, as Bill
Berkson speculates, the poem's sense of urgency may well have to do with
the publication, that same year , of another long poem by a friend
of the very same age--<I>Howl</I> by Allen Ginsberg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  "In Memory of My Feelings" opens as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The crisis O'Hara presents so movingly here is that of objectification
by the other. At the outset, the poet's "naked selves" are endlessly
victimized and terrorized: "A gun is

<B></B>

'fired,'" and "pink flamingoes" absurdly crush "one of me" "underneath
their hooves," leaving behind "terror in earth, dried mushrooms,
pink feathers, tickets" (<I>CP</I> 253). A little further along, "My
transparent selves / flail about like vipers in a pail, writhing and
hissing / without panic" (ibid.). Indeed, memory only increases the pain
and humiliation: "My father, my uncle, my grand-uncle and the several
aunts"--these become nothing less than "the dead hunting" the "alive,
ahunted" (ibid.). The poet's mind, trying to deal with these memories
of victimization is "like a shuttered suite in the Grand Hotel / where
mail arrives for my incognito, / whose fa&ccedil;ade has been slipping
into the Grand Canal for centuries" (<I>CP</I> 254).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This last passage is characterized by the "performative fluency" that Katz
speaks of, the campy power to construct alternate identities that allow
one to survive. In the gay poetry of the sixties, a central strategy is
humor: for much of this poem, O'Hara's narrator is able to laugh at his
past exploits and at "the occasion of these ruses" (<I>CP</I> 257). Many
of the "memories," moreover, far from being actual recollections, are
based on various Hollywood films, as in the comic passage about Lord
Nelson, where the "meek subaltern writhes in his bedclothes / with the
fury of a thousand, violating an insane mistress / who has only herself
to offer his multitudes" (<I>CP</I> 255). The resort to imaginary memories
that are actually quotations from other works, thus distancing the reader
from the poet's inner turmoil, distinguishes O'Hara from the Confessional
poets of the fifties and sixties. "Personism," as O'Hara conceives of it,
is not "personalism."

It is a brilliant performance but one that cannot last. The fifth and
final section opens with the short line "And now it is the serpent's turn"
(<I>CP</I> 256). How to reconcile the phallic serpent to "the heart /
that bubbles with red ghosts, since to move is to love"? Fantasies of
domination give way to a reprise of erotic/masochistic dreams, whether of
"being shot / by a guerrilla warrior or dumped from a car into ferns,"
or a

moment in which "The hero, trying to unhitch his parachute / stumbles
over me. It is our last embrace" (ibid.). "The fancy," in Keats's words,
"cannot cheat so well / As she is fam'd to do." Hence the poignancy and
pathos of the poem's ending:

There is much more to be said about this complex poem, but here I want
to focus on its relationship to Johns's painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  In both cases, meaning is created by juxtaposition of unlike items
  in an intricate network of metonymic images. In the poem, for
  example, the various unrelated scenes of hunting and war--whether
  remembered incidents or allusions to World War II films, or even pure
  inventions--play on the fear and paranoia of the poet, or again, the
  great-aunt's "blood vessels [that] rushed to the surface / and burst
  like rockets," can be related to the Grand Canal scene in Venice,
  where "rockets splay over a <I>sposalizio</I>" (<I>CP</I> 254),
  and then to the "fury of a thousand" in the Lord Nelson scene. In
  the same vein, while the painting has no focus or vanishing point,
  no re silhouetted against a ground, no symmetry between left and
  right halves, the shape of the spoon handle is metonymically related to
  paint shapes throughout, and the brushstrokes, as I have already noted,
  create structures of great intricacy. Or again, in <I>Watchman,</I>
  the little red stick at bottom left echoes the line of the chair back
  in the upper right, even as the black and white strip with its drips
  at the bottom of the frame carries on the rhythm of the vertical strip
  above it to create a T-shape. Each part of the canvas is as important
  as every other part, the principle being, again in Stein's words,
  "use everything."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both poem and painting create tension between formal abstraction and the
introduction of ordinary, everyday objects. "My quietness has a man in
it," gives way to the particularism of O'Hara's absurdist catalogues,
even as Johns's painting projects the suspended spoon and fork against a
backdrop of thick and separate brushstrokes. The curious tension between
the abstract and the "real" also produces a marked eroticism. In a comic
allusion to Whitman's <I>Leaves of Grass,</I> O'Hara's

But what about Johns's hidden "DEAD MAN"? How does this reference
relate to the "man" in O'Hara's first line--"My quietness has a man
in it"--or to those later multiple "selves" who must, in the end, be
"killed" so as to "save the serpent in their midst"? It is in their
treatment of death that O'Hara and Johns part company. O'Hara is still
very much a post-Romantic poet, yearning for presence, for a particular
palpable self that is anchored in a particular body. However much his
"I" clowns around, playing self-deprecating games with what Katz calls
"performative fluency," however much he can laugh at his own past
and present inadequacies and postures, the driving force of the poem
is <I>anxiety</I> (which is also the title of one of his most moving
poems--see <I>CP</I> 268), a free-floating fear whose ultimate object,
death, is never far away, as in "A Step Away from Them," where not even
the "beautiful and warm" avenue can dispel the thought that "First /
Bunny died, then John Latouche, / then Jackson Pollock," or as in the
last two lines of "Music," where the poet's buoyant mood is dispelled
by the thought, "But no more fountains and no more rain / And the stores
stay open terribly late" (<I>CP</I> 258, 210). O'Hara's most famous poem,
let's remember, is the elegy "The Day Lady Died."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For O'Hara, death and petrifaction (as in the Medusa's stare in
"In Memory") are omnipresent, threatening at every moment to destroy
the fragile self. Evidently, Johns recognized this vulnerability: in
<I>In Memory of My Feelings--Frank O'Hara,</I> he writes "A DEAD MAN"
in big block letters, only to "<I>cover it with paint. Rub it against
canvas. Skull against canvas.</I>" John Cage, visiting Johns in Edisto
Beach, where the latter had evidently undergone a bout of depression,
catches this mood perfectly in <I>Jasper Johns: Stories and Ideas.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Contemplating Johns's map and flag paintings, Cage remarks, "Stupidly
  we think of abstract expressionism. But here we are free of struggle,
  gesture, and personal image. Looking closely helps, though the paint
  is applied so sensually that there is the danger of falling in love"
  (<I>YM</I> 83). This subtle distinction between personal gesture and
  the sensuality of the paint itself refers obliquely to the distinction
  between the gesture painting (or gesture poetry) of the fifties and
  the more conceptual art of the sixties (his present in the essay),
  when the erotic became, so to speak, a source of ideation rather than
  personal image. Indeed, to come back to the title, unlike O'Hara's
  memory of his feelings, Johns's "memory" is not of former "feelings"
  or the specific incidents, real and imaginary, that generated those
  feelings; the memory, rather, is of his earlier art works: flags,
  canvases, numbers, letters, targets. It is this particular continuity
  that gives comfort.

Cage, who declares himself somewhat intimidated by the "enigmatic aura
of his [Johns's] personality," understands this perfectly (<I>YM</I>
73). "<I>A Dead Man,</I>" he knows, could be used as well as anything
else to give life to a given painting: "<I>Take a skull. Cover it with
paint. Rub it against canvas.</I>" The shape of a skull, as Johns depicts
it, is not, after all, all that different from a light bulb. Indeed, the
skull-rubbing exercise was soon to be taken quite literally. In May of
1962, Johns made <I>Study for Skin,</I> a series of four drawings made by
pressing the artist's lubricated face on paper and then rubbing charcoal
on the paper to render the oiled surface visible. The resulting images
are strangely indeterminate. On the one hand, we can see them, especially
No. 1 (<A HREF="8.2perloff_0.html"> 10</A>), as images of an
eyeless face, flanked by hands spread on a pane of glass, behind which

<B></B>

the man to whom they belong is somehow trapped. On the other, they
are, in Cage's words, "Structures, not subjects" in their successive
transformation of recognizable object into abstract form (<I>YM</I>
75). "He sometimes," says Cage, "introduces signs of humanity to intimate
that we, not birds for instance, are part of the dialogue. . . . Finally,
with nothing in it to grasp, the work is weather, an atmosphere that is
heavy rather than light . . . in oscillation with it we tend toward our
ultimate place: zero, gray disinterest" (<I>YM</I> 76). The "scene of
my selves," to use O'Hara's phrase, is gradually occluded.

line never quite anticipating the placement of the following. The poet
who had always celebrated change, motion, vitality, and openness, here
cannot get beyond his obsessive death thoughts. Like Johns's charcoal
"skin" rubbings, the clouds are said to "go soft"--an absurd remark
since clouds are soft by definition, constantly change color, and
inevitably sink, whether, as here, into the sea or behind mountains,
trees, or buildings. The references to the moon launch and Sputnik
in lines 5-11 only serve to intensify the poet's own isolation:
"Sputnik," after all, means "travelling companion," wryly suggesting,
in an echo of Philip Sidney's famous sonnet "With how sad steps, oh
moon . . .", that even in outer space there must be more companionship
than here on earth. Down here, even as the years tick off inexorably
("the shirts change, endless procession"), everything remains the same
("they are all neck 14 sleeve 33"), the armholes imperceptibly turning
into graves. "No more conversion, no more conversation": nothing but the
"zero, gray disinterest" Cage discerns with reference to Johns's drawings.

The last two lines of "The Clouds Go Soft" are especially arresting. Here
it is not, in the words of the popular song, smoke that "gets in your eye"
but sand that "inevitably seeks" it. Smoke is ephemeral whereas sand can
cause permanent damage to the eye. And yet O'Hara's reference is also an
in-joke, an allusion to the actual sand at Edisto beach. Just a few months
earlier, in a letter-poem called "Dear Jap," O'Hara had written, "When
I think of you in South Carolina I think of my foot in the sand." The
reference is to Johns's <I>Memory Piece</I> (<I>Frank O'Hara</I>) begun
in 1961 (<A HREF="8.2perloff_2.html"> 12</A>), made by

placing a rubber cast of O'Hara's foot into the hinged lid of a small
pine box, so that, when the box is closed, the cast foot makes an imprint

Barely legible in the visual field of Johns's <I>Skin with O'Hara
Poem,</I> "The Clouds Go Soft," is thus an apt analogue to the composition
of body fragments--helpless, extended hands, palms against an invisible
surface, flanking a smudged black facial contour, rather like an image
of the Crucifixion or perhaps Veronica's Napkin--in the lithograph. But
why did poet and painter never complete the originally projected
portfolio of collaborations, of which <I>Skin</I> turned out to be the
only exemplar? My guess is that the personal anguish expressed in this
and related O'Hara poems of 1963 was one that Johns, having undergone a
similar personal crisis, had schooled himself, probably with Cage's help,
to submit to the discipline of formal structuration, thus depersonalizing
the visual field.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  <I>Skin</I> is a bleak, unsettling picture, but the source of pain is
  not specified: it might relate to war as readily as to the sorrows
  of lost love. "I'm interested," as Johns was at pains to tell David
  Sylvester shortly after exhibiting <I>Skin,</I> "in things which
  suggest the world rather than suggest the personality" (<I>WSI</I> 113).

By 1964, in any case, Johns was spending more time than ever with Cage,
Cunningham, and David Tudor. In March, en route to Hawaii and Japan, he
traveled with Lois Long and Cage to San Francisco, where Cage performed
with Tudor at the San Francisco Tape Music Center. It was at one of their
performances that Johns noticed the spot of light on the ceiling--a
reflection from the mirror in a woman's compact--that gave him the
idea for the reflective light he was to use shortly in the painting
<I>Souvenir 2</I> (<A HREF="8.2perloff_3.html"> 13</A>)--a
painting that incorporates a penny arcade self-portrait placed on cheap
souvenir plate. After vacationing with Cage and some others in Hawaii
in April, Johns left for Tokyo, where he painted <I>Watchman.</I> A new
phase had begun.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the notebook sketch for the painting, let's recall, Johns distinguishes
between a watchman who "falls 'into' the 'trap' of looking" and a spy
who "must be ready to 'move' must be aware / Of his entrances &amp;
exits." The watchman "leaves / his job &amp; takes away / no information,"
whereas the spy "must remember / &amp; must remember himself &amp;
his remembering." And further: whereas "The spy designs himself to be
overlooked," "the watchman 'serves' as a warning." But a warning of
what? Perhaps that the poetry of immediate presence of a Frank O'Hara,
especially fetching and brilliant as it was in those poems of the late
fifties like "Why I Am Not a Painter" or "Khrushchev is coming on the
right day!" was no longer sufficient: "The spy stations himself / to
observe the / watchman." Indeed, one way to understand such Johns works
as <I>In Memory of My Feelings--Frank O'Hara, Skin with O'Hara Poem,</I>
and <I>Watchman,</I> is as covert critique of O'Hara's "Personism,"
with its potential "fall 'into' the 'trap' of looking" and its "tak[ing]
away" of "no information."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  Against this particular posture, this "occasion of my ruses,"
  Johns puts forward a "cool" Conceptualism that takes the mode of
  the painter's earlier Flags, Targets, Numbers, and Alphabets to its
  logical conclusion. But "cool" is of course itself a cover: the very
  absence of "personal" references or images of human life is itself a
  sign of pathos. And what could be more "emotional" than the sense of
  disjunction and mismatch (of letters with colors, and so on) displayed
  in paintings like <I>Watchman</I>?

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Does the "information" Johns speaks of relate to McCarthyite surveillance
and the Cold War discourse of spying, as Roth thinks? Perhaps these
notions are subliminally present. In a larger sense, however, the
distinction is one between <I>warm</I> and <I>cool,</I> between the
gestural expressivity of the second-generation New York painters and
poets of the late 1950s, and the more ideational, philosophical, and
distanced art that inevitably came into being (whether consciously
or not) in response to the political climate of the sixties. For the
autobiographical "imprint" found in such poems as "Joe's Jacket," Johns
substitutes the rubber imprint of O'Hara's actual--but in the context,
wholly anonymous--foot. Were it not for the title <I>Memory Piece [Frank
O'Hara]</I>, the viewer of Johns's box construction could not possibly
identify this foot's owner. "The spy," remember, "designs himself
to be overlooked." Thus, in the ambitious <I>According to What,</I>
painted later in 1964, the self- portrait of <I>Souvenir</I> has been
painted over and replaced by the work's title, even as the painting itself
contains oblique references to all of Johns's earlier work, specifically,
the leg and chair, hinged canvas, sign letters, color chart, newspaper,
coat hanger and spoon, the primary color abstraction and tonal scale.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Accordingly, when Johns becomes the director of the Merce Cunningham
Dance Company in 1965, he "designs" scenery that involves no painting
or drawing on his

<B></B>

part at all, but is, on the contrary, a conceptual set based on
Duchamp's <I>Large Glass (The Bride Stripped Bare of Her Bachelors,
Even).</I> It consists of the seven components of the <I>Glass</I>
as Duchamp had designated them in his diagrams: <I>The Bride, Milky
Way, Nine Malic Molds, Glider and Water Mill Wheel, Chocolate Grinder,
Oculist Witnesses,</I> and <I>Sieves or Parasols.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  In an interview with James Klosty, Johns explains how, having obtained
  Duchamp's approval, he painted the images on plastic in a friend's
  Canal Street loft, and then transcribed them onto seven vinyl boxes
  of varying shapes and sizes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The resulting dance piece, <I>Walkaround Time</I> , was not
entirely successful and is infrequently performed, probably because,
as Merce Cunningham recalls, "the seven objects of the <I>Glass</I>
. . . limited very much what one could do in the space; it meant that
all of your traffic had to be lateral from one wing to the other."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  But despite its choreographic problems, <I>Walkaround Time</I> is a
  brilliant conceptual work, testifying to the role intertextuality
  can play in the process of "stationing [one]self to observe the
  watchman." In a 1967 page of Johns's sketchbook we read:

But O'Hara's good humored and self-deprecating gesture of tolerance
becomes, in Johns's own writing, a pressing metaphysical question. And
such questions, themselves inevitably political in their implications,
proved central to the "new art" and "new poetry" of the sixties and to
their legacy to the increasingly pervasive Conceptualism of the nineties.

There are various ways to improve one's chess game. One is to take back
a move when it becomes clear that it was a bad one. Another is to accept
the consequences, devastating as they are. Johns chooses the latter even
when the former is offered. Say he has a disagreement with others; he
examines the situation and comes to a moral decision. He then proceeds,
if to an impasse, to an impasse. When all else fails (and he has taken
the precaution of being prepared in case it does), he makes a work of
art devoid of complaint. [<I>YM</I> 74]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A work of art <I>devoid of complaint.</I> "A painting," as Cage interprets
Johns, "is not a record of what was said and what the replies were
but the thick presence all at once of a naked self-obscuring body of
history" (<I>YM</I> 79). The personal now becomes inseparable from the
political. "The spy," let's remember, "must be ready to 'move,' must be
aware of his entrances &amp; exits." In this way, what was perceived by
contemporaries as indifference can now be understood as an oblique but
necessary form of intervention. In Johns's words, "Take an object. Do
something to it. Do something else to it" (<I>WSI</I> 54).
