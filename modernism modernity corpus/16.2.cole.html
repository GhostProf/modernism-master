</blockquote>
<p>The explosion of bombs is an inescapable feature of the contemporary world. Marked by suicide attacks around the globe, and in the aftermath of a century which turned the bombing of civilians into the norm for warfare, our era seems unthinkable without such destruction. In the nineteenth century, by contrast, dynamite explosion represented an entirely new form of violence, as Alfred Nobel's invention of 1866 helped to sweep the world into its modern shape. From the moment of its inception, dynamite violence became an immediate and ever-escalating sensation, with its stunning ability not only to kill and maim, but within seconds to level an entire landscape.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The violence of dynamite reverberated in every sensory register as something novel (hence sensational in that way, too), from its chemical smell, to its shattering sound, to its extreme tactile effects, and it held pronounced political associations, quickly becoming associated with terrorism. It shattered, exploded, ripped, and tore; it created its own palpable and recognizable form of wreckage; and its employment for radical causes suggested a future with unknowable and potentially frightful contours. In sum, dynamite violence added a potent new element to the modern imaginary. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Its literary and cultural legacy in England in the last decades of the century, and into the modernist period, is the subject of this essay.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Dynamite's violence might be wide and indiscriminate, but its users were very particular: revolutionaries, and above all, anarchists, who were red incessantly and in near-caricature as bomb-wielding maniacs.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> "In late-nineteenth century America," the historian Margaret Marsh writes, "the mention of the word 'anarchist' brought to the minds of most people a particular image: an unkempt, bushy-bearded man, swarthy and dirty, lurking in a dark alley with a bomb hidden under his coat."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The bomb and the anarchist were partners; to understand the cultural significance of one is to permeate the world of the other. In addition to conjuring a typology of violent actors, the presence of dynamite made for complex, often flamboyant plots and styles, and its effects on the body created exceptional challenges that literary works both engaged and elided. Despite the excess attaching to this complex story—or perhaps as a consequence of it—to resurrect both the cultural and literary history of anarchism in this period is to draw a variety of conclusions about how the imagining of political violence and literary form did and did not cooperate.</p>
<p>For anarchists themselves, dynamite held highly idealized associations: it offered new vistas of power, not solely for its potential to wreak destruction, but also for its ability to terrify a wide public. The connotations of dynamite for radical politics are hard to overstate. It was the ultimate weapon of the one against the many, of any individual with only a smattering of training, or connection to other revolutionists, and a will to kill. The dynamite bomb seemed tiny in proportion to its capacity to do harm; it could fit easily into a small bag, or even a pocket. Above all, as the historian Paul Avrich argues, dynamite had virulent class connotations, and this is why its association with anarchism and with other kinds of radical threat was so profound:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Dynamite, in the eyes of the anarchists, had become a panacea for the ills of society. They saw it as a great equalizing force, enabling ordinary workmen to stand up against armies, militias, and police, to say nothing of the hired gunmen of the employers. Cheap in price, easy to carry, not hard to obtain, it was the poor man's natural weapon, a power provided by science against tyranny and oppression . . . Just as gunpowder had broken the back of feudalism and made way for the rule of the bourgeoisie, so dynamite would bring down capitalism and usher in the reign of the proletariat.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>If anarchists hailed dynamite for its equalizing properties, the broader culture was equally infatuated. The re of the anarchist bomber (the "dynamitard" in contemporary parlance), his violent acts (referred to as "outrages" or "<span style="font-style:italic;">attentats</span>"), his favored technology (especially dynamite bombs), and his uncertain aims (total destruction, according to most accounts) together presented the British public with a nexus of problems and images which, for three decades, were explored in journalism and in fiction.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Not surprisingly, popular novels that invoked the specter of anarchist violence flourished in this period, in a subgenre—the dynamite novel—which freely employed elements common to such nineteenth-century genres as the detective novel, the industrial novel, (proto)science fiction, fantasy novels of invasion and/or world war, and melodrama.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  These texts—with such titles as <span style="font-style:italic;">A Modern Dedalus</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">For Maimie's Sake: A Tale of Love and Dynamite</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Dynamiter</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Hartmann the Anarchist</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Angel of the Revolution</span> —helped to conre the anarchist as type, and also lingered on the physical quality of dynamite, with villains inevitably designated as chemists and the smoke of detonated bombs a feature of the ever-threatened landscape. Many of the more lavish dynamite novels, in which imagery of revolutionary violence reaches feverish proportions, feature hyperbolic uses of the substance, such as anarchists raining fire on London by dropping dynamite bombs out of fantastical airships.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> In these works, the unrestrained power to destroy offers the guiding principle in ring political and social change. Indeed, the most salient and consistent characteristic of dynamite, as it was imagined and represented in fiction and elsewhere, was the hyperbole and excess it generated—in a word, its melodrama.</p>
<p>To call the representation of dynamite violence "melodramatic" is not so much to invoke the specific genre of melodrama (a nineteenth-century stage phenomenon), as to suggest a general emotional and gestural framework, what Peter Brooks has dubbed "the melodramatic imagination" and Elaine Hadley "the melodramatic mode."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> The standard features of melodrama, which saturated Victorian literature and continue to demarcate a swath of literary and popular culture, are familiar: "the indulgence of strong emotionalism; moral polarization and schematization; extreme states of being, situations, actions; overt villainy, persecution of the good, and final reward for virtue; inflated and extravagant expression; dark plottings, suspense, breathtaking peripety."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Such hyperbolic and polarizing structures belong to a popular imaginary that rehearses in secular form many Christian themes, and works to create in readers or viewers heightened responses commensurate with the tantalizing content. Melodrama can be highly political in purpose—one need only think of <span style="font-style:italic;">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> —with a politics that necessarily conforms to its own language conventions, sustaining and perpetuating its logic of good/virtue versus evil/vice. Like the Gothic, with which it overlaps, melodrama has often been tied in the public mind with the feminine, the un-theorized or unconscious, and above all the lowbrow. With rising interest in these categories, however, melodrama has emerged as a distinctly interesting category, and for good reasons: first, because a great variety of texts (canonical and forgotten, by men and women) relied for their sensibility on a melodramatic point-of-view; second, because persistent structures of thought and action like the melodramatic are frequently rendered in complex conrations, producing interesting generic mixtures and shifts; and, most importantly for our purposes, because there are certain topics that are invariably red in melodramatic terms. Dynamite violence is melodramatic in this last sense. The very idea of "explosion" suggests polarity and excess, and the connection between bombs and revolution made for a dizzying affective register, conjuring a sense of threat that held highly moral connotations (hence rewarding melodramatic treatment). By the end of the nineteenth century, in short, melodrama and anarchist violence had both become bywords for sensational events, overwrought emotion, and schematic plots, and thus their yoking has about it an inescapable logic. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The most canonical rendering of anarchist violence in English literature comes in Joseph Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> , and a reading of that novel forms the crux of my discussion. But Conrad's work points outward towards a variety of intimately related issues, including the popularization of the anarchism theme in varying literary media, the intractable question of sensationalism in relation to the envisioned threat of anarchism, and the thicket of contradictions surrounding the re of the anarchist himself. Most central for this investigation are the questions of genre that extenuate from these topics. As I will suggest, the overlapping of the generic qualities of melodrama with representations of anarchists and dynamite reveals a paradox in the literary imagining of political violence: politics all but disappears, leaving behind an aporia, which is quickly filled by the ready-at-hand genre of melodrama. Or, to put it slightly differently, the mutual attraction between melodrama and dynamite violence tended to overwhelm and drown out the kind of political critique propounded by anarchists and other revolutionaries of the period, but it promoted a vivid capacity for rative meaning-making and a flourishing of literary outcomes.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In Conrad's novel, however, we can point to one re, the bomb-making Professor, who slips out of the melodramatic frame altogether to incorporate and instantiate a new phenomenon, one just developing in the public imagination of the early twentieth century: the terrorist as urban threat. Though "terrorism" and "anarchism" were not synonymous in this period, they were closely allied, and the new icon of the terrorist—a term used by some as a pejorative and by others as an honorific—developed largely out of the fascination with the anarchist bomber. For Conrad, as for many others, terrorism became a marker for a threat of violence that was virtually defined by its ability to disappear. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>—a novel that delves deeply into the nature of secrecy, deconstructing it at every turn—propounds a logic of increasing invisibility with regard to the specter of violence. The novel registers a triple move: from reckoning with the attacked flesh (violence enacted), into melodrama (violence as theatricality), and ultimately towards an image of modern violence as pure, endlessly-suspended potential. Violence, we might say, goes underground in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, much as anarchists taking refuge in London were forced to do by the beginning of the twentieth century; or, better, Conrad traces a wider phenomenon of the period that spans from the events of the novel  to its publication thirteen years later, whereby the <span style="font-style:italic;">spectacle</span> of theatrical violence mutates into the threatening yet obscure <span style="font-style:italic;">possibility</span> of attack. That this latter condition tracks both Foucault's definition of modern cultures (as discipline internalized) and the general condition of the terrorist threat up to the present time (recognizing the possibility of explosion at any moment) suggests that for all its satire and excess—and despite its generally conservative politics—the novel has something exceptionally astute to say about the intertwining of violence and modernity.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I. Imagining Revolutionaries and their Acts</h1>
<p>The last two decades of the nineteenth century might well be called the era of anarchism. The period was marked by a string of sensational acts of violence against <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  individual leaders and representative targets—bombings, shootings, and assassinations that riveted the public and were heavily reported by the press in England, America, and across Europe. To give just a few of the most notable examples: In 1881, Czar Nicholas II was ambushed on the road and assassinated by a nihilist<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a>; two German anarchists, Franz Rusch and Friedrich Reinsdorf, attempted to kill the German emperor in 1883 by blowing up his carriage; in Chicago in 1886, a bomb was thrown at the police as they broke up a labor gathering—the infamous Haymarket case—for which five anarchists were wrongly executed (the actual bomb-thrower was never identified); the anarchist Alexander Berkman shot the steel magnate Henry Clay Frick at close range in 1892, injuring but not killing Frick; in 1894, the anarchist Émile Henry threw a bomb into the Café Terminus in Paris, wounding twenty people, killing one, and generating a frenzy of press attention; in the late 1890s, the leaders of France, Spain, and Austria were all killed by revolutionaries with anarchist affiliations; and in 1901, President McKinley of the United States was shot and killed by a Polish man with loose anarchist ties. In England, no lethal bombing of a public place or prominent leader was ever carried out, the only person to be killed by an anarchist attack in England being Martial Bourdin, the bomber whose accidental self-immolation at the Greenwich Observatory forms the basis of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. Yet a slew of attacks and attempted attacks received intensive coverage in the press, including attempts to blow up London Bridge , Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament , and Greenwich Observatory ; multiple plots to assassinate Queen Victoria; the arrest and sentencing of a group of anarchists in the city of Walsall for bomb manufacture ; as well as international anarchist incidents and trials, such as those listed above.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, in the public eye, anarchism always spelled violence, "a bloody and smoking chaos, a heap of ruins of all existing things, a complete loosening and severance of all ties that have hitherto bound men together: marriage, the family, the Church, the State, unbridled men and women no longer held in order by any authority, and mutually devouring each other," in the words of one fictional commentator of the period.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Notwithstanding the hyperbole of such terms, the sense that the political movement of anarch<span style="font-style:italic;">ism</span> signaled the unleashing of anarch<span style="font-style:italic;">y</span> became a persistent misconception in the period, one that has never fully abated.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> In fact, anarchism embraced violence as a means to a peaceful end, in which the state and its oppressive mechanisms would have melted away, replaced by a harmonious world order. Nevertheless, the anarchist ideal of the destruction of the state, when yoked in the public mind with high-profile assassinations and bombings, invited a fervent, dystopic response. "'To destroy everything,'" is the avowed aim of the movement, according to an anarchist character in Émile Zola's <span style="font-style:italic;">Germinal</span> , "'Set fire to the four corners of the town, mow down the people, level everything, and when there is nothing more of this rotten world left standing, perhaps a better one will grow up in its place.'"<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Or, in the words of one revolutionary from the forgotten <span style="font-style:italic;">Hartmann the Anarchist</span>, "'Violent diseases often demand violent remedies . . . Regard us anarchists as excising the foul ulcers of Humanity and as forced to perform that duty with no anaesthetics [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] to aid us."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>What was anarchism?<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The word "anarchy" means "against authority," and it is the opposition to all forms by which one person can hold power over another that most succinctly characterizes the philosophy. Anarchism comprises different branches and emphases, but in every case it opposes the defining institutions of formal power and authority: government, the Church, and the legal system.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> It stands absolutely against the state—any state, worker or bourgeois, post-revolutionary or capitalist—which it believes inevitably institutes inequality and injustice.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The theory of anarchism developed in the early 1860s, largely out of the writings of the French philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the activities of the Russian Mikail Bakunin, whose life in exile involved the creation of several notorious secret societies. It entered what we might call its heyday from the early 1880s until the end of the century, when anarchist movements flourished across England, America, and the Continent, and when public fascination was at its apogee. In the twentieth century, anarchism had sporadic life in many parts of the world, with perhaps its most significant manifestation in Spain, where anarchist groups were central actors in the Civil War, ting against Franco's fascist army (1936–39). In England, however, the anarchist movement began its decline around the turn of the century, as aggressive tactics of police suppression, including the shuttering of anarchist journals and the tightening of immigration and deportation laws, eventually eradicated any serious presence. Up to then, England's relatively lenient laws had provided refuge for anarchists exiled from more repressive parts of the world. Historically, anarchism emerged side by side with other radical political movements of the mid-nineteenth century, a response to the egregious injustices of the industrial revolution, in a movement which reached out, especially, to the most disenfranchised among the poor, whom Marx called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lumpenproletariat</span>. Proudhon famously claimed that "property is theft," yet anarchism was not, for all its attack on private property, entirely a workers' movement. It took its membership from all classes, and it had high-profile embodiment in the persons of Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, early and late leaders of the movement, both Russian aristocrats.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best moniker for depicting how anarchists and their bombs were imagined in their own time comes in the term anarchists coined to rationalize and explain their mode of violence: "propaganda-by-deed."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Propaganda-by-deed became canonized as allowable violence, and, as such, it partially underwrote the movement. Clearly, there is something seductive for revolutionaries in the act of violence, and anarchists often invoked a rhetoric of purity and fertility in destruction. As Bakunin wrote, "Revolution requires extensive and widespread destruction, a fecund and renovating destruction, since in this way and only in this way are new worlds born."<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Thus anarchists at times called for "a clean sweep" of the entire social order as a necessary preface for a revived, better world.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> If rebuilding the world required that it first be destroyed, then the technology of destruction must be cultivated. The science of bomb making became a central feature in anarchist ideology and literature from the early 1880s, the most notorious instance being Johann Most's <span style="font-style:italic;">Revolutionary War Science</span> , a bomb-making tract that circulated widely and clandestinely throughout Europe and America for decades, and made the German-born author one of the most feared anarchists in the world. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>It is not only the theory of propaganda-by-deed that caught people's attention, but the term itself, which was used ubiquitously. At the literal level, the term stresses the revolutionary message ("propaganda," a word whose negative connotations post-date this period) over the violent "deed." In a similar vein, theorists of terrorism in our own, contemporary context have argued that terrorism is best understood as a form of (wildly excessive) communication.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Without minimizing the often horrendous facts of terrorist violence, this theory emphasizes that the act of violence is meant to send a message, to utilize highly spectacular and news-garnering violence as a form of language—what Émile Henry, the Café Terminus bomber, called "the voice of dynamite."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Or, as Vladimir declares of anarchists in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, "bombs are your means of expression."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Propaganda-by-deed is a principle of action that assumes interpretation, under the premise that those reacting from the outside will see a clear and causal relationship between the destruction at hand and an already-known political message. It thus demands an unlikely cohesion, at the level of signification, between perpetrators and the public.</p>
<p>All of this has the ring, moreover, of the theatrical, highlighting the act of a single protagonist, as he stands, momentarily, apart from the broader movement; it seems ready-made for vilification, but also for tragedy. So Oscar Wilde, in his first play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Vera, or the Nihilists</span>  creates in his melodramatic heroine an embodiment of idealistic purpose married to self-sacrificing energy—propaganda-by-deed in its most unblemished guise. Vera is pure of heart and irreproachable in her motives (though she does help to assassinate the Czar); if she could carry out the revolution on her own, she certainly would.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Such an image differs in important ways from the other central formula for radical violence in the period, the General Strike ("direct action"), in which the individual actor is submerged by the group, and the violence of sheer numbers replaces the individual bomb-thrower as locus of destruction. Or perhaps it is best to see these two distinct modes as contributing together to a broad conceptualization of radical violence in the period, where direct action conjures the image of vast organized (or perhaps dangerously disorganized) masses, while propaganda-by-deed suggests the supremely motivated individual. With the theatricality of propaganda-by-deed, the central actor is red in hyperbolic, gestural terms, as one who understands himself to be engaged in performance, and the whole enterprise radiates with an exuberantly aesthetic quality.</p>
<p>A hybrid of revolutionary self-representation and equally vivid reactionary portrayal, the person of the anarchist bomber was typically red in stylized terms—a repository, we might say, for a certain literary zeal. For instance, the question of what kind of person would or could become an anarchist and how to amalgamate him into an understandable frame of reference, came wreathed in intriguing contradiction. As the narrator of Conrad's "The Informer" remarks, "anarchists in general were simply inconceivable to me mentally, morally, logically, sentimentally, and even physically."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> On the one hand, it was unsurprisingly the case, as Haia Shpayer-Makov notes, that the anarchist "was greeted [in the press] with the stock rhetoric and imagery commonly applied to the Irish, the socialists, and other 'deviant' groups . . . The anarchist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  was associated with revolutionism and violence, and as such stood in opposition to the self-image of British society as an orderly and law-abiding community."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> On the other hand, for all the invective directed towards anarchists and other "degenerates," there was an appealing mystery about this re. In popular dynamite novels, anarchists were often surprisingly likable, their motives laudable, even as they tapped into a reservoir of anxiety about revolutionary madness and extremity.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the anarchist was imagined as a destroyer, unconstrained by ordinary ethical norms, single-mindedly driving the revolution via the commission of "outrages." The historical names attached to this image come thick and fast: Sergei Nechaev set the tone, authoring a chilling tract (some believe in collaboration with Bakunin<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a>), entitled "Catechism of the Revolution," which spelled out the image of the terrorist in cool, calculated detail. Johann Most, the maker of bombs, offered an image of science gone horribly wrong, as he willingly dispersed the technology of killing, seemingly indifferent to human life.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The exuberantly self-righteous and famous Ravachol was a French anarchist who became something of a folk legend, after being guillotined in 1892 for a series of dynamite attacks; his song, "La Ravachole," (a revamping of the Revolutionary anthem <span style="font-style:italic;">La Carmagnole</span> and the epigraph for this essay) remained as an echo of his fiery views, with lines like "Let's blow up all the bourgeois/ We'll blow them up!", and its refrain, "Long live the sound/ Of the explosion!"<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Then there was Émile Henry, who declared to the judges at his trial for the Café Terminus bombing, in which he was sentenced to death, that "the bourgeoisie must be brought to understand that those who have suffered are tired at last of their sufferings," and that anarchism "will end by killing you."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Alexander Berkman, as unapologetic at his trial for shooting Frick as Henry was at his, depicted the attempted assassination, in a widely-read prison memoir , in riveting, moment-by-moment narration. The list goes on, but what seems most notable in each case is the sense of drama, sensation, and narrative possibility around each of these (in)famous res, who seem as much like literary creations as historical personages.</p>
<p>Nechaev's landmark "Catechism," written in 1869 as a statement of revolutionary methods and creeds, and garnering long-lasting status as underground dogma, provided an image of the terrorist that was in every sense literary: it both derived from and inspired fictional characters, it very self-consciously imagined the terrorist as a persona or model, and it carried a strong sense of aura or mood.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> The first line, "The revolutionary is a doomed person," establishes its ethics of insurrectionary violence primarily as a matter of the commitment, courage, and ultimate selflessness of the terrorist himself:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>There exists only one contentment for him, one consolation, reward and satisfaction—the success of the revolution. Day and night he must have only one thought, one goal—merciless destruction. Striving cold-bloodedly and tirelessly to this goal, he must be always ready to die himself and to kill with his hands all that prevents its accomplishment.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The rebel of the "Catechism" holds intimately with death: he not only kills, but does so with his bare body, his "own hands." A complete loner, the anarchist-as-terrorist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is enjoined to foreswear all ties of personal affiliation, indeed to relinquish his very humanity in the name of the cause: "All tender or softening feelings of kinship, love, gratitude and even honor itself must be suppressed in him by the only cold passion [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] of the revolutionary task." This ideal of a revolutionary with an absolute and dominating purpose reached far and wide within radical circles. John Henry Mackay, in a semi-autobiographical novel about London anarchism in the 1880s, sums up the influence in creating one of his characters as a disciple of Nechaev:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>At the age of twenty-four he is a terrorist. He has learned them by heart, those mad eleven principles "concerning the duties of the revolutionist to himself and to his fellow-revolutionists" . . . He journeys from city to city. Everywhere he tries to undermine the existing order of things . . . He trusts only in the revolution henceforth.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Restless and itinerant (another hallmark of historical anarchists, a result of frequent deportations and threats of arrest), the anarchist of the "Catechism" seems to be everywhere and nowhere, a subversive agent of the modern world, relentlessly working to carry out his mission of total destruction.</p>
<p>Yet for all the asceticism and grim determination in these portrayals, we also find in many works a streak of joy and pleasure in the act of violence, viewed as revenge-taking against deserving exploiters—the <span style="font-style:italic;">jouissance</span> of the deed, we might say. Berkman, for one, saw in reprisal killing the germination of his own manhood: "Could anything be nobler than to die for a grand, a sublime Cause? . . . And what could be higher in life than to be a true revolutionist? It is to be a <span style="font-style:italic;">man</span>, a complete MAN. A being . . . who has emancipated himself from being merely human . . . " (emphasis in original).<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Readers attuned to postcolonial discourse might note the affinity between this language and a postcolonial model of generative violence, such as that invoked by Franz Fanon in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wretched of the Earth</span>, which imagines a virile, colonial masculinity emerging from the t against European oppressors. Both of these radical positions, in turn, gain momentum from a Christian rhetoric of martyrdom and self-sacrifice, as the revolutionary investment in the body aligns itself with other mystical and masculinist traditions. In Berkman's language, two different sacrificial bodies are suggested: that of Frick, who stands in for all exploiters, and that of the incarcerated or executed revolutionary, whose expendable body is subsumed in the cause.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> The dualist underpinnings of Western sacrificial logic, the apotheosis accorded to the person who gives his body in the name of some larger commitment, the Christian promise of a glory that disdains bodily pleasure and rewards bodily privation—such conventions are perpetuated in radical conceptions of the revolutionary hero.</p>
<p>Indeed, a central tenet in many representations was an almost-religious fervor defining the anarchist. Zola's Souvarine in <span style="font-style:italic;">Germinal</span>, a novel focusing on a massive mining strike, is one such re. Souvarine's affect is one of ironized detachment in relation to the industrial action at the center of the novel's plot (nothing more than "foolery," as he repeatedly terms it), but he becomes powerfully animated when he describes his vision of the destruction of the world: "As he talked, Souvarine grew terrible. An ecstasy raised him in his chair, a mystic flame darted from his pale eyes, and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  his delicate hands gripped the edge of the table almost to breaking" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ger</span>, 254). Such mystic transformation is as powerful as it looks, moreover, for Souvarine's ultimate act of terrorism overshadows the many local, grisly, often frightful scenes of violence the novel catalogues. The anarchist's form of destruction, mirroring his feverish power, is on an entirely different order from even the most feared forms of revolutionary rampaging. "He had vitality enough in him to bring the dead to life, passion enough for a hundred men," is how one sympathetic novelist depicted the leader of the Haymarket anarchists.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Or, again, the London-based anarchist Stepniak wrote of "The Terrorist" that, "he is noble, terrible, irresistibly fascinating, for he combines in himself the two sublimities of human grandeur: the martyr and the hero."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> In all of these portraits, the anarchist is portrayed as a person powerfully motivated to change the world. It is on the future, and perhaps on the past, that he fixes his gaze ("he will march onward . . . certain that justice will be rendered to him in his tomb," in Stepniaks's language), the present will always be the object of destruction, and contemporaries will be the least likely to embrace the terrorist himself.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> There is drama (or melodrama) here, emblazoned on the terrorist's features. Yet this re, with his dreamy qualities and exaggerated characteristics, also lends himself to parody, or to a charge of inefficacy and fantasizing. As the decades of anarchist activity began to wane in England and other European countries in the early twentieth century, the icon of the lone terrorist out to change the world with his bombs was ripe to become a ludicrous image of narcissistic self-delusion.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Whether efficacious or ridiculous, anarchists in the British imagination were always understood as foreign. There is some legitimacy to this stereotype, for anarchism was not a British-born phenomenon and was fundamentally international in spirit. Its roots ran deepest in Russia, though foundational thinkers came from all over the continent; there was a great deal of itinerancy among anarchists, so that a typical anarchist meeting in London might include Russians, French, German, American, and other Eastern European participants; and Jews made up a robust complement of the movement, especially in London and in large American cities like New York and Chicago, where Yiddish-language anarchist journals flourished alongside those in English, French, German, Italian, and Russian.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> The anarchist's canonical foreignness cut in a variety of directions. The question, for instance, of what might attract an English person to the cause became the subject for speculation. Dynamite novels often red an English protagonist who finds himself immersed, for one reason or another, in an anarchist organization created and dominated by foreigners. Henry James's Hyacinth Robinson, at the center of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Princess Casamassima</span> , is the most famous such character. Less canonically, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Angel of the Revolution</span>, a novel featuring the total overthrow of the world order by a band of idealistic Russian insurrectionists, the protagonist is something of a regular English type—a public-schoolboy bachelor and unlikely candidate for anarchism—who eventually becomes a leader in the movement. Robert Louis and Fanny Stevenson, co-authors of a strange little pastiche of a novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dynamiter</span>, portray a series of English male dupes seduced by beautiful, snake-like revolutionary women. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Girl Among the Anarchists</span>, an autobiographical novel by Helen and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Olivia Rossetti (nieces of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and cousins of Ford Madox Ford) the authors take up the question of how a middle-class Englishwoman becomes entangled in the anarchist movement. Detailing the protagonist's experience as a convert to anarchism and the eventual editor of an anarchist journal (and hence at the very center of the London scene), it offers a lively inside look at anarchism from the perspective of a sympathetic middle-class woman.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> These English-born anarchist characters each raise the question also posed urgently by the historical bombings on English soil, one which points straight to the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>: what does it mean for dynamite violence to lodge right here, at home?</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II. Explosion and Melodrama: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>
</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> accords with many works of the three preceding decades in simultaneously taking seriously the political violence of anarchism and relentlessly denuding it of its most prized qualities. Its darkly comic tone and hyperbolic parody powerfully debunk the movement and its personae, and have led some commentators to see it primarily as a reactionary fable. Yet what makes <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> especially rewarding as a reflection on the culture of political violence at the turn of the century is that it plunges headlong into the material realities of dynamite violence, even as it capaciously incorporates nearly all the tropes and strategies for representing terrorism that circulated in the contemporary culture. Above all, Conrad considers the nature of dynamite's sensation: how dynamite violence registers ethically as a subject for fiction, what its shock-value means for characters and plots. In Conrad's novel, we find the four key terms brought vividly together—dynamite, anarchism, sensation, melodrama—and out of this jostling quartet of historical and literary phenomena emerges a new and eerie image of the future. The literary flamboyance of sensationalism and melodrama are given a moment of triumph in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, before they are eroded by an insinuation of ongoing and insidious dread.</p>
<p>We might note, at the outset, a distinguishing feature of Conrad's tone with respect to his subject matter: his insistence on the meaninglessness surrounding the Greenwich bombing, and his stress on the contrast between motive (obscure and cynical) and outcome (gruesome and extreme). In an author's note appended to the 1920 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, Conrad describes the Greenwich explosion in terms of its unfathomability. The affair, he declares, was:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>. . . a blood-stained inanity of so fatuous a kind that it was impossible to fathom its origin by any reasonable or even unreasonable process of thought. For perverse unreason has its own logical processes. But that outrage could not be laid hold of mentally in any sort of way, so that one remained faced by the fact of a man blown to bits for nothing even most remotely resembling an idea, anarchistic or other</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 5).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">If the underlying precept of propaganda-by-deed is interpretive—that there is, in fact, an idea at the basis of every terrorist act—Conrad dismisses this premise, supplying his <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  own ethical and literary standards. The expression of violence and the expression of motive are thoroughly disengaged, Conrad suggests, and it is in this gap that the literary interest arises. Dynamite explosion thus brings to the fore such Conradian features as ambiguity and unknowability—a disjunction between horrendous realities in the world and obscure signifying practices—or, as he repeatedly res it in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, the specter of insanity. "'Madness alone," as Vladimir puts it, "is truly terrifying'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 31). The evasive and yet ratively rich possibilities glimpsed in the gulf of meaning surrounding extraordinary (or insane) violence make dynamite explosion particularly resonant for Conrad, drawing him to consider its cultural and bodily expressions, and leading him into commensurate generic directions.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>And Conrad knew a great deal about anarchism.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> He may have declared himself, in personal letters and in the author's note to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, to be uninformed about the workings of anarchists, which he brushed off as only of vague interest, and about the Greenwich bombing of February 1894, which he claimed not to have followed in the papers at the time or to have researched in any detail when composing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. But critics have taken these statements to task and shown quite conclusively that Conrad was highly educated on the topic of anarchist violence.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> He had access, through Ford, to the London anarchist scene and to insider accounts of what may have actually transpired in the Greenwich case; there is every reason to believe he had, in fact, followed the reportage of the Greenwich explosion at the time and read further about it in later years; his personal and familial history gave him a special interest in the workings of European revolutionaries—all of this is amply evident.</p>
<p>In fact, even without scholars chasing him down, Conrad gives himself away in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, as well as in the author's note. There, over a decade after composing the novel, his prose is still inundated by the journalistic language of anarchism (he uses terms like "outrage" in double and triple senses; repeatedly employs "anarchism" as both a philosophy and a form of meaningless destruction; is still consumed with the sensationalism of dynamite explosion). The novel itself, composed, it should be stressed, well after the period it depicts, is so replete with characters and plots out of that earlier period as to read like a handbook of late-Victorian conventions for construing the anarchist scene. So, for instance: the idea that anarchism and violence are inescapable partners is writ into the saga as a premise; the presence of dynamite is the lynchpin of the text in several respects; the anarchists in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> fall into typologies as they so often did in the literature of the period, each portraying some aspect of the terrorist persona; semi-fictionalized events like the Rome conference to which Vladimir refers have historical counterparts<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a>; and the novel returns incessantly to a number of themes that dominated the late-Victorian rendition of anarchism, such as the emphasis on bombs as the inevitable tool of anarchists, the freighted relation between words and deeds, and the international quality of the movement. Moreover, Conrad mirrored in his novel the reportage of the Greenwich bombing in many particulars. The newspaper coverage of the bombing was detailed, wide-ranging, and often gruesome, as, for instance, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span>' initial report of the scene: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The first [park keeper] to arrive found a man half crouching on the ground. His legs were shattered, one arm was blown away, and the stomach and abdomen were torn open. [new paragraph] As the keeper came up to him the man faintly besought help and then fell forward on his face, unconscious, in a great pool of his own blood.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Such reportage would have been hard to miss, even for someone without Conrad's particular interests and connections. All of this reminds us, in part, of how directly the discourse of one's surroundings gives shape and intelligibility to historic events. In the case of anarchism, it was the sensational news-worthiness of the topic that provided its essential, guiding principle.</p>
<p>Less obviously, Conrad's ambivalent position about writing what we might call "historical fiction" suggests a central orientation of his novel: an oscillation between an attention to the materiality of both history and the body and a recourse to generic forms like caricature and melodrama that reduce the pointedness of such efforts. We might look, for instance, to the novel's first page, to see how this dynamic gets established:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls; nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines; closed yellow paper envelopes, very flimsy, and marked two and six in heavy black res; a few numbers of ancient French comic publications hung across a string as if to dry; a dingy blue china bowl, a casket of black wood, bottles of marking ink, and rubber stamps; a few books with titles hinting at impropriety; a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers, badly printed, with titles like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Torch</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gong</span>—rousing titles. And the two gas-jets inside the panes were always turned low, either for economy's sake or for the sake of the customers.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 9).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Conrad's realism here is oblique, since it gives a detailed and evocative sense of setting precisely through a language of evasion ("more or less," "nondescript," "like," "as if," "hinting at," "apparently," "obscure," "either . . . or"). When we do get a concrete detail, in the names of the two anarchist journals, Conrad's method becomes even more elusive: one of these, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Torch</span>, was an actual journal (edited by the Rossetti children), while the other the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gong</span>, is a fictional take-off on such real "rousing" periodicals as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Alarm</span>. Why mix the historical detail with the facsimile, the exact with the parodic? The answer, I think, is that the novel wants simultaneously to offer a harrowing account of the visceral and precise materiality of anarchist violence, and to evade that materiality via the ruses of genre, to wit via caricature and melodrama. Conrad is not so much toying with history as developing an accordion-like movement in and out of history, which in turn also implies a movement closer and further from the body. The novel makes these counterpointing moves—in the direction of and away from an embodied sense of history—from the novel's first paragraphs through to the author's note of the next decade, but it is in the text's crisis event that this structure takes most powerful form.</p>
<p>I have said that dynamite explosion in this period signified the violence of anarchism. Nowhere is such an explosion more vividly imagined than in the destruction of Stevie in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Another waterproof sheet was spread over that table in the manner of a tablecloth with the corners turned up over a sort of mound—a heap of rags, scorched and bloodstained, half concealing what might have been an accumulation of raw material for a cannibal feast. It required considerable firmness of mind not to recoil before the sight . . .</p>
<p>. . . The Chief Inspector's eyes searched the gruesome detail of that heap of mixed things, which seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops.</p>
<p>"You used a shovel," he remarked, observing a sprinkle of small gravel, tiny brown bits of bark, and particles of splintered wood as fine as needles.</p>
<p>"Had to in one place," said the stolid constable. "I sent a keeper to fetch a spade. When he heard me scraping the ground with it he leaned his forehead against a tree, and was as sick as a dog."</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 70–71).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Stevie's story embodies real pathos, from his beginnings as the victim of paternal brutality, to a life marked by scant affection and by frustrated attempts to imagine and promote social justice, to his hideously violent demise. Chief Inspector Heat perhaps speaks for all of us when he surmises about the effect of the bomb's "ruthless cruelty" at the moment of Stevie's death: "The man, whoever he was, had died instantaneously; and yet it seemed impossible to believe that a human body could have reached that state of disintegration without passing through the pangs of inconceivable agony" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 71). It is crucially important for the novel's reflection on violence, as well as its meditation on time, that Conrad jumps over the bombing itself, giving us only its remnants, yet insisting that to contemplate these remains is to step imaginatively back in time to the moment of their ghastly creation. It may simply be impossible, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, to bracket the moment of explosive violence—hence the Professor's feverish labor to create the perfect detonator, one which would somehow eliminate the fateful twenty seconds between detonation and explosion.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Stevie's empathy for suffering brings him closer than anyone else in the novel to the social vision of the period's revolutionaries. If the novel's four anarchists —Yundt, Michaelis, Ossipon, and the Professor—are eviscerated of any real humanity and represent something like an amalgamated and distorted portrait of actual and imagined terrorists, Stevie-as-representative lurches in the opposite direction, embodying a generalized empathy for suffering of the sort that animated historical anarchists to an important degree.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Or we might put it this way: Conrad very self-consciously sets out to caricature the anarchists at the same time that he gives us a version of anarchism's message in the person of Stevie, who functions as a whirling vortex of impressions stamped by the sadistic world around him. Stevie's sense that life is marked by pain and cruelty, and his status as the whipping boy for life's brutality, make him especially responsive and susceptible: literally, as he is physically destroyed by violence, and ratively, as he reacts to the suffering he envisages around him. Dogged by a "morbid horror and dread of physical pain," Stevie visualizes physical suffering in others with precision, as, for instance, when he responds to Yundt's vivid depiction of the ruling classes as cannibalistic torturers: "Stevie knew very well that hot iron applied to one's skin hurt very much . . . it would hurt terribly" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 42). Where Yundt's language <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  dwells with evident relish on the misery of exploited flesh ("'Can't you smell and hear from here the thick hide of the people burn and sizzle?'"), Stevie's response is visceral, personal, and direct—in a word, humane (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 41).<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> And we are told, moreover, that the fourteen-year-old Stevie, riled to fury at the mistreatment of fellow workers, had set off fireworks in the office where he was employed as an errand boy, in the hopes, apparently, of destroying the place. Such an event quite clearly refers to a type of anarchist "outrage," in marked contrast to the novel's Greenwich bombing, whose social and political meaning is entirely contrived by cynical operatives, working in the interest of their own power.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Stevie the anarchist even has a slogan of his own, developed in his sputtering way, in response to his interaction with a one-armed cab-man and his decrepit horse: "'bad world for poor people'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 132). "Bad world for poor people" is certainly an accurate description of the state of poverty in urban London, and it also mirrors the kinds of messages about social injustice that anarchists and other revolutionaries worked to disseminate. The scene in which this lesson is learned, however, is a tour de force of comic writing (a simultaneous satire and enactment of the classic industrial novel, and a blistering riff on Raskolnikov's dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">Crime and Punishment</span>), and it would be difficult to take Stevie's moral encapsulation of the social drama witnessed there as the novel's own unironic credo.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Indeed, as a spokesman for social justice, the well-meaning Stevie is nevertheless a caricature, just as the image of him as modern artist is equally satiric: ". . . the innocent Stevie, sitting very good and quiet at a deal table, drawing circles, circles; innumerable circles, concentric, eccentric; a coruscating whirl of circles that by their tangled multitude of repeated curves, uniformity of form, and confusion of intersecting lines suggesting a rendering of cosmic chaos, the symbolism of mad art attempting the inconceivable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 40).</p>
<p>If Stevie's status as artist and anarchist is at once constructed and denied, his physical being remains shockingly visible. More generally in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, the flesh of humanity has an inescapable and ubiquitous presence. Conrad seems unusually repulsed in this novel by the body, which appears outsized, a stifling physical cage to match the claustrophobia of the urban scene. And these are not incidental suggestions of disgust: the critic James English, for one, has located the crux of Conrad's political intervention in his creation of such res as the fat anarchist, an irony that encapsulates a variety of contradictions in the political imaginary of the period. For the anarchist to be fat is to inhabit precisely that which he is supposed to destroy (the fattened bourgeoisie being a stock image for the hated status quo, as in my epigraph from Ravachol) and to embody a whole series of ironies about their (in)efficacy and belatedness.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> All of this attention to the flesh reaches its apex in the person of Stevie, whose quivering body reacts to the felt reality and to the mere prospect of pain. When Stevie is blown up, his dripping, shattered remains seem like a confrontation to any form of conceptual or literary accommodation. Stevie is now all flesh, his chaotic artistry the abstraction of a body whose contours have been entirely fragmented and erased. In this scenario, his body's radical fleshiness loses its status as satire and becomes, instead, an unbearable burden. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This notion of burden is literalized in the object that comes to symbolize Stevie's decimated state: the shovel. The shovel that they use to scrape up his scattered body parts—the shovel that is a part of every reference to his death—becomes the metonymical trace of a physical situation almost too gruesome to contemplate. The novel pulls back from Stevie's death—the thought of what kind of agony he might have suffered in the instant of explosion left as a haunting question—but it repeatedly returns to the shovel. A rustic and primitive implement, a distinctly humble object, the shovel is associated not so much with the urban scape of London as with the ground in general, the site of agriculture and also of burial. It is strikingly an object; with its simple form and universal recognizability, it is completely visually available. When pain becomes unimaginable, it seems, the imagination turns to what it knows. In the passage where Stevie's remains are initially described, this crystallizing of affect into the shovel takes two forms: first, it is the sound of the shovel (rather than the sight of Stevie's exploded body) that induces the keeper's vomiting, and second, the invocation of the shovel immediately follows two metaphors ("what might have been an accumulation of raw material for a cannibal feast"; "which seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops"), both of which are jarringly incongruous, and which, in a sense, are replaced by this much more vivid image. The shovel works metonymically: more than any metaphoric solution (cannibal feasts, rag shops), by holding and touching the body's remains, it stands imaginatively for their terrible reality. Metonymy nudges out metaphor, bringing us closer to the body, but that metonymy immediately works too well, generating a vivid return to the body (in the form of the keeper's reaction).</p>
<p>The descriptive quality of language thus reaches an impasse with the fragmented body of Stevie, an impasse that will call up a variety of responses. But the first response is to linger on the shovel. Winnie, for one, returns instinctively to it:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>That's where the boy was killed. A park—smashed branches, torn leaves, gravel, bits of brotherly flesh and bone, all spouting up together in the manner of a firework. She remembered now what she had heard, and she remembered it pictorially. They had to gather him up with the shovel. Trembling all over with irrepressible shudders, she saw before her the very implement with its ghastly load scraped up from the ground.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 195–196)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Though Winnie's structures of thought may not be exactly normative—her susceptibility to journalistic phraseology, for instance, approaches the pathological—her response to Stevie's body in ruins does function paradigmatically. An excess of violence, here, pushes the imagination not towards any given political meaning (as the principle of propaganda-by-deed would suggest) but towards a kind of imagism that exists at the opposite end of the intelligible spectrum. There is no "idea" to associate with the shovel; its work seems to belie the very notion of interpretability.</p>
<p>Such spare imagism, a reaction to the exploded body, must nevertheless confront dynamite's other central attribute: its sensationalism. I have said that dynamite violence was sensational almost by definition, incorporating its key components of graphic violence, the threat of escalation, and mystery. Sensationalism, one of modernity's endlessly self-fulfilling vices, represented a central pivot point in late-Victorian conceptions of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  modern crime. Over and over, the culture asked itself whether and how the media (especially newspapers and fiction) influenced criminal behavior, seeming to indict some of its most basic impulses, such as the dissemination of information and the abhorring of violence. The never-solved Ripper murders in London's East End , to take the most notorious case, spawned its own textual industry, in a lavish display of interest, fascination, anxiety, and seemingly endless hand-wringing with respect to responsibility.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> The mutuality linking horrific crime with an ever-broadening news media thus represents a rich topic in Victorian cultural history; with respect to our specific themes, the history of anarchism and the theatricality of dynamite violence were always thoroughly intertwined with sensationalism. The notion of "propagandaby deed," for instance, depended on a sensationalist-minded press, which would spread word of anarchist outrages far and wide, and would help to stir public fear and interest. More generally, what makes a crime "terrorist" in structure is its determination to send a message, and for this print journalism was the central organ of communication.</p>
<p>When fiction takes up these subjects, it almost inevitably slips under the rubric of sensationalism, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, which makes the proximity between the novel and the newspaper visible at every turn, is especially interested in confronting its own relation to news in general and to sensationalism in particular. Conrad presents the language of the press as ubiquitous and insidious, its formulae encased in the mind, and also in a relation of adjacency (as with the shovel and the body). So, for instance:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It was a raw, gloomy day of the early spring; and the grimy sky, the mud of the street, the rags of the dirty men harmonized excellently with the eruption of the damp, rubbishy sheets of paper soiled with printers' ink. The posters, maculated with filth, garnished like tapestry the sweep of the kerbstone. The trade in afternoon papers was brisk, yet, in comparison with the swift, constant march of foot traffic, the effect was of indifference, of a disregarded distribution.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 65).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Layers upon layers of proximity: the ink rubs against the papers (an interesting form or writing), the city's grime against people and advertisements, the papers against the passing multitudes, who are all the more receptive for their obliviousness and indifference.</p>
<p>"Rubbing off" seems the appropriate re for the uneasy relation of the news media to political violence, both within <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> and in the contemporary understanding more broadly. The question of what effect journalism had on the escalation of anarchist attacks was always a thorny one. If journals of all sorts made hay out of the specter of anarchist violence, there was also an uneasiness as to whether their saturation coverage might contribute to the celebrity, and hence, in a certain way, success, of the revolutionaries. Not surprisingly, Conrad offers a variety of viewpoints on this question.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> On one hand, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, he suggests that the grimy printers' ink has rubbed off on the populace to such a degree that they can only think in terms of journalistic formulations. So Winnie is driven mad by the journalistic phrase "the drop given was fourteen feet," and Tom Ossipon, for all his self-serving callousness, is also haunted by the language of the newspapers, in this case the melodramatic account he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  reads of Winnie's death: "<span style="font-style:italic;">An impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever over this act of madness or despair</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 228, italics in original). The suggestion here is twofold: that people learn how to read their own interior lives by what they read in the papers (a familiar postmodern insight), and that the nature of this particular "simple tale," as Conrad subtitled the novel, is so entwined with the kinds of events covered in newspapers and journals as to make it almost emanate from the press. It is highly appropriate, then, that when Winnie learns about her brother's death, her first response is to rip a newspaper down the middle.</p>
<p>Yet if the novel critiques the insidious power of the press to construct human interiority, it also succumbs to the general infatuation with anarchist violence, as understood and imagined by journalists at the time of the Greenwich bombing. Though the shovel appears to have been Conrad's innovation, and though Bourdin was actually alive when first discovered (quite unlike Stevie), the novel remains true to contemporary newspaper accounts, which returned ineluctably to the bomber's body. The degree to which Bourdin was mangled, the image of his torn body in what appeared to be a kneeling position, the speculation about where and how the explosion occurred and what the effects must have been on his person—all of this was subject to intense speculation. For journalists in the 1890s, and for Conrad ten years later, it was that exploded body which provided the animating core of the story. Indeed, Conrad's decision to write a novel about the Greenwich bombing at all testifies to his attraction to sensational news, since no "outrage" generated more coverage in England than this one. As Vladimir—Conrad's strange alter-ego in the novel, who plots its course and explicates its mysteries even before they exist—muses, "Every newspaper has ready-made phrases to explain such manifestations [as political assassination] away," but an outrage like the Greenwich bombing would be sure to rise to new levels of sensation (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 30).</p>
<p>More generally, Conrad was concerned both with the problem of how the press reports violent events, and with the way such reportage correlates to the imaginative capacities of the citizenry. In "Autocracy and War" , an essay he wrote as he was composing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, Conrad worries about the availability in England of authentic accounts of the Russo-Japanese war, then underway. The war, he writes, "has been made known to us, so far, in the grey reflection of its terrible and monotonous phases of pain, death, sickness; a reflection seen in the perspective of thousands of miles, in the dim atmosphere of official reticence, through the veil of inadequate words."<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> The problem, for Conrad, is not so much the bad faith of the newspapers (as suggested in the phrase "official reticence") as the deep limitations he feels hamper ordinary human faculties for apprehending violence in its fullest materiality. The real crux lies in the narrowness that Conrad believes to characterize the imaginative range of those reading from the safety of home.</p>
<p>In fact, for Conrad, what differentiates the situation of the victims of modern war from the kind of suffering which is capable of moving English citizens—the example he gives is of an "over-worked horse falling in front of our windows, [or] a man writhing under a cart-wheel in the street"—is that the former is infused with politics and the latter with melodrama (<span style="font-style:italic;">NLL</span>, 112). Journalism can do justice neither to the richness <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of history nor to the magnitude of a human crisis. "There must be something subtly noxious to the human brain in the composition of newspaper ink," Conrad reflects:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>. . . or else it is that the large page, the columns of words, the leaded headings, exalt the mind into a state of feverish credulity. The printed page of the Press makes a sort of still uproar, taking from men both the power to reflect and the faculty of genuine feeling; leaving them only the artificially created need of having something exciting to talk about</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">NLL</span>, 121).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">As in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, where the newspaper is red in terms of its materiality, here, too, the physical paper—its ink, style, format—seems to determine its content. That format, in Conrad's view, transforms a story of both physical and historical magnitude into a catalyst for inauthentic feeling. Heightened emotion of a comfortably familiar variety elbows out the more difficult reckoning with political violence.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what happens in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>: it turns from the unendurable reality of Stevie's body and the shovel to the melodramatic story of Winnie's revenge and suicide. In doing so, it moves from a form of violence whose contours are unfixable, as the body itself becomes fragmented beyond recognition, and whose roots are sunk in political intrigue, to a kind of violence that can be understood because it can be attached to firm literary traditions (sentimentalism and melodrama). Or, we might say that the novel shifts from political violence to domestic violence—"from a certain point of view," the Assistant Commissioner notes, "we are here in the presence of a domestic drama" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 168)—and in this movement, it taps into available narrative conventions.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> The characterization of the tale as a "domestic drama" highlights the novel's central, overdetermined location of the home—a home that, in Winnie's case, is anything but protective.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> For Winnie's background, like her brother's, has been a life-long story of spiraling and shifting violence. Like Stevie, she has a visceral empathy for victimization, born of her own terrified childhood. Despite her placid exterior, that is, Winnie's is the interiority of "the potential violence of tragic passions," and she feels her brother's death as "a white-hot iron drawn across her eyes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 160, 182). Conrad treats Winnie's and Stevie's family background allusively, by suggestion more than detailed narration, but his representation of the traces of domestic violence in their persons nevertheless suggests something important about how violence operates. Conrad, like the nineteenth-century industrial novelists who preceded him in considering an endemic social violence, presents this brutal background as a matter of exposing the violence that attends the lives of the working classes ("bad world for poor people," to recall Stevie's formulation), and also as a kind of metaphor or originating point for the ensuing violence that sweeps through the novel.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with domestication, violence in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> becomes conceivable; it can find its conventions. The first killing in the novel—the destruction of Stevie—was one which, again, Conrad claimed "could not be laid hold of mentally in any sort of way." By contrast, the second murder, when Winnie kills Verloc, bears the hallmarks of a kind of sensationalism that can be considered amenable to a reading public, indeed to those very readers of grimy newspapers with bold headlines of whom Conrad had <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  despaired in "Autocracy and War." Though both bodies inspire their discoverer to vomit (the keeper in the case of Stevie, Ossipon for Verloc), the spectacle of Verloc's body is quite different from the "sort of mound" that marked Stevie's lumped remains:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It was the handle of the domestic carving knife with nothing strange about it but its position at right angles to Mr Verloc's waistcoat and the fact that something dripped from it. Dark drops fell on the floorcloth one after another, with a sound of ticking growing fast and furious like the pulse of an insane clock. At its highest speed this ticking changed into a continuous sound of trickling. Mrs Verloc watched that transformation with shadows of anxiety coming and going on her face. It was a trickle, dark, swift, thin . . . Blood!</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 199).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">What a striking contrast divides the defining object that touches Verloc's body—the carving knife—from the shovel that bore Stevie's remains. If the latter suggested a challenge to metaphor, along with an imaginative return to rusticity and the fundamental mortality of the body, the carving knife brings us back to the realm of fiction, and particularly to sensational crime fiction. As a talisman, the carving knife promotes itself as the signifier for a popular literature that stands in the same relation to Conrad's ironized tales of political intrigue as the "sea life of light literature" read by a young Lord Jim stands to Conrad's fractured imperial tales.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> And just as <span style="font-style:italic;">Lord Jim</span> ultimately enfolded its own romantic narrative, seeped in orientalism and exuberant as a generic getaway, so <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> eventually presents the dripping blood of a thriller. It becomes, at least for a while, a familiar kind of suspense story. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that both implements, the knife and the shovel, signal the promise and the problem of sensationalism in their own forms: the shovel by way of self-critique, pointing to the novel's concern with its own adjacency to journalism, the latter by way of inaugurating a style within a style, a popular tale of sentiment within an ironized account of the brutal, modern city. Conrad himself described <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> as "a sustained effort in ironical treatment of a melodramatic subject," but it is perhaps more accurate to see irony and melodrama in something of a competition.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> In terms of violence, irony gives way to melodrama, as the conventions enabling the representation of violence as melodrama supercede the murky and uncertain linguistic possibilities that obstruct the approach to Stevie's decimated body, the victim of dynamite.</p>
<p>If we return to Winnie's "pictorial" response to her brother's death, we will find the movement from inconceivable explosion to literary accommodation encoded in her structure of thought. Winnie at first conjures the shovel, as we have seen ("Trembling all over with irrepressible shudders, she saw before her the very implement with its ghastly load"). What follows is a move away from that object and into a more frenzied pictorial panorama:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Mrs Verloc closed her eyes desperately, throwing upon that vision the night of her eye-lids, where after a rainlike fall of mangled limbs the decapitated head of Stevie lingered suspended alone, and fading out slowly like the last star of a pyrotechnic display. Mrs Verloc opened her eyes.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 196). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The garishness of Winnie's vision of her brother's head floating in the sky suggests an entirely different imaginative system from the grounded realism of the shovel. In fact, that realist moment fell in the middle of this sequence, momentarily freezing the working of her fervent vision, making her shudder (like Stevie himself), but she circles back, as her eyes close, to the fireworks where she began, which recall Stevie in a double sense, since his exploding of fireworks was the early sign of his anarchist tendencies.</p>
<p>As Winnie's imagination indicates, explosive violence ultimately calls for rative hyperbole, not imagism but imagistic overload—indeed the supplanting of the unimaginable body by the concrete object makes the first such move. At one level, the simple shovel with its material load would seem to offer the kind of image that literature especially rewards, in comparison with the bizarre fireworks that surround it in Winnie's vision. But, in fact, when the night of Winnie's eyelids descends, what emerges is the flamboyant image, the extreme metaphor, the flaunting of rative language. The mangled body, with its tell-tale implement, stops short the imaginative process; it returns Winnie to her own body, as she shudders irrepressibly. When her vision of fireworks resumes, the exuberance of the rative capacity reasserts itself. This showcasing of an extreme literary flair, I am suggesting, mirrors, encodes and propels the novel's wider transformation from ironized political drama, where the reality of dynamite violence ferociously cuts through the text, to a melodrama which continues the thematics of violence, but within a more theatrical, derealized mode. It is a mode that makes room for open-endedness ("<span style="font-style:italic;">an impenetrable mystery seems to hang forever over this act of madness or despair</span> . . .") via the language of melodrama, and where the sensation of an invisible suicide has all the pathos missing from the awful remains of an unknown—and, for Conrad, ontologically unknowable—anarchist. The unfathomable nature of exploded bodies and political crime thus gives way to another kind of mystery, one kind of madness to another.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II. Dynamite and the Future</h1>
<p>When dynamite explodes, it leaves behind total fragmentation; but it also creates gashes and tears in the landscape, and these imprinted patterns lead us to the final re I shall discuss, the Professor in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. Let us consider, in a brief side-tour, the novel Conrad wrote immediately before <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent, Nostromo</span>, which has more in common with its follower than might immediately be evident. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nostromo</span>, after all, has its own dynamite. The San Tomé mine—at the epicenter of the novel's plot, and providing Sulaco with cultural capital in every sense—is the product of a neat dynamite blast. Described as a "re-opened scar in the flank of the mountain," it provides a visual reminder of explosion.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> More importantly, the mine's life and productivity are safeguarded by the promise of yet more detonations: "'I have enough dynamite stored up at the mountain to send it down crashing into the valley,'" the novel's <span style="font-style:italic;">uber</span>-capitalist Charles Gould explains, "'to send half Sulaco into the air if I liked'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nos</span>, 170). Or again, "He was prepared, if need be, to blow up the whole San Tomé mountain sky-high out of the territory of the republic" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nos</span>, 294). Charles <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Gould's use of dynamite as prophylactic against political upheaval represents a brilliant re-imagining of the contemporary infatuation with dynamite as the material, <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>, of anarchism and revolution. By surrounding the mine, dynamite creates a safety wall around it; by promising to explode the mountain completely, it leaves the partial explosion (the gash) intact, thus continuing to yield its many treasures, material and cultural, in the interest of the English and their allies.</p>
<p>Gould's trick is spectacularly successful. It also spawns a surprising imitator: the Professor in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, who safeguards himself from arrest by carrying a bomb on his person at all times, ready to explode himself (and his potential arresting officer) at a moment's provocation. As he explains it, the police "'know very well I take care never to part with the last handful of my wares. I've it always by me.' He touched the breast of his coat lightly. 'In a thick glass flask'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 55). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nostromo</span>, the dynamite is kept at a slight remove from the mountain, just as the gash remains only analogous to the body. But in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, the bomb is nestled on the body, and the hand remains vigilantly on the India rubber ball. The masturbatory image of the Professor grasping the ball in his pocket is no doubt comic, but it is also menacing, crude, and precise. By lodging the device on his body, the Professor indissolubly links protection with annihilation, the prophylactic of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nostromo</span> combined with the immense destructive (and self-destructive) force of popular accounts of anarchism, the ultimate mechanism of survival with a material vision of explosion—"a dreadful black hole belching horrible fumes, choked with ghastly rubbish of smashed brickwork and mutilated corpses" is how Ossipon expresses his vision of the effects the Professor's bomb would have were it to explode (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 56). It is as if, in the re of the Professor, Conrad has distilled the dispersed political imaginary surrounding anarchist violence into the tightest of spaces, the "frail" little being of this destructive agent (one of the few characters in the novel who is not fleshy and obese), folding into itself a generalized image of violence that, in the case of the mine, was instead <span style="font-style:italic;">ex</span>foliated—political violence as productive because always held at bay.</p>
<p>The Professor is, of course, what in contemporary parlance we would term a "suicide bomber," or at least he holds out that possibility as his final card to play; in this role, he assumes a new kind of power in the text, what he calls "force."<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> It is the power of the weapon become the person, of a complete intertwining of the man himself with an explosive device. In an early discussion with Ossipon, the Professor credits his effectiveness ("'I am deadly'") to "'force of personality,'" a sheer will to destruction, which matches his desire for "a clean sweep and a clear start for a new conception of life,'" language which gestures in the direction of Nietzsche, and which closely echoes actual and fictional anarchists from the period (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 57, 56, 61). Monomaniacal in his search for a perfect detonator, indifferent to any form of human attachment, ascetic in his habits, the Professor has much in common with Nechaev's terrorist from the "Catechism of the Revolution," and, as in Nechaev's treatise, this combination suggests an image of disproportionate power. The Professor is no man of the people—indeed his detestation and horror of the masses signal his most notable weakness—a preacher less of revolution than of simple violence. In his opening colloquy with Verloc, Vladimir had <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fantasized about the perfect dynamite attack as one lodged <span style="font-style:italic;">into</span> "pure mathematics," but we can also see such a logic extended to the person of the Professor, who represents something like the potential for an attack <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> pure mathematics (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 31). Conrad seems to agree with the professor's own arrogant sense of his destructive reach, yielding the novel's final paragraph to him and, perhaps surprisingly, given what many critics take to be an attitude of contempt for all the anarchists in the text, using the ambiguities of free indirect discourse partially to echo his self-assessment:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>And the incorruptible Professor walked, too, averting his eyes from the odious multitude of mankind. He had no future. He disdained it. He was a force. His thoughts caressed the images of ruin and destruction. He walked frail, insignificant, shabby, miserable—and terrible in the simplicity of his idea calling madness and despair to the regeneration of the world. Nobody looked at him. He passed on unsuspected and deadly, like a pest in the street full of men.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 231)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">For all Conrad's diminishment of the Professor here, the bomb on his body nevertheless transforms London's citizens into his potential victims, a condition that virtually defines the state of terrorism. "He was a force": the term, used repeatedly by and about the Professor, stresses something new in the novel's conception of violence. The very idea of force is sweeping and overpowering, and, in this case, also invisible. This is what gives force its charge, its "terrible . . . simplicity." Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> is a "simple tale" not only for its focus on the bare dynamics of familial revenge, but because it culminates in the "simplicity" of a violence that is propelled by a politics-free lust to annihilate.</p>
<p>The Professor may himself have "no future," but he offers, quite precisely, an image of the future for the rest of modernity's citizens. It is a future defined by dynamite's hidden presence, by the invisible threat of a single individual, a mere speck amidst "the multitude of mankind," with an excess of violent will. "He was going over there, to the unknown. He was going tranquilly to extermination, wherever there might be dynamite to blow up towns and men. He will be there, without doubt, when the middle class in agony shall hear the pavement of the streets bursting up beneath their feet": not the Professor this time, but Zola's Souvarine, this agent of future destruction is another member of the pantheon of terrorists who were imagined, in a sense, as survivors of their own era, hurtling forth into a dystopic futurity (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ger</span>, 504–505). If the general melting of anarchism into melodrama seems to suggest a comfortable eclipsing of its threat, the preserving of the terrorist bespeaks quite a different reckoning with violence in the future. In the end, the structure of anarchist violence seems to come down to two poles: the exploded body (Stevie's physical decimation) and the menace of the Professor (endlessly seeking a form of total annihilation). What differentiates them, of course, is agency: the body whose obliteration represents an insane crash of force from nowhere and for no purpose, and the body whose self-construction as bomb represents the potential explosion of force from a single point and in a surfeit of pure purpose. In between falls a complex state of horror, empathy, uncertainty, fear, and ultimately, imaginative possibility, whose other name, perhaps, is modernity. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="fn-head">Notes</h1>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f1" href="#f1-text">1. </a>A number of the most inflammatory anarchist works, which have always circulated in clandestine form, are only readily available online. For these, I use web addresses in my citations. For "La Ravachole," see <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ravachol/la-ravachole.htm" target="_blank">http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ravachol/la-ravachole.htm</a></p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f2" href="#f2-text">2. </a>The OED defines "sensational" as follows: "Of works of literature or art hence of writers: Dealing in 'sensation', aiming at violently exciting effects. Also of incidents in fiction or real life: Calculated to produce a startling impression." As these terms ("violently exciting effects," "startling impression") indicate, it appears to be endemic to the very definition of "sensational" to consider the personal, social, and ethical consequences of its effects. The term entered usage in the early 1860s, alongside the literary phenomenon of the sensation novel. For discussion of some of these issues, see Patrick Brantlinger, "What Is 'Sensational' about the 'Sensation Novel'?", <span style="font-style:italic;">Nineteenth-Century Fiction</span> 37, no. 1 (June 1982): 1–28; Ann Cvetkovich, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mixed Feelings: Feminism, Mass Culture, and Victorian Sensationalism</span> (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1992); and D.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>My interest in this paper centers on the extensive, public ramifications and representations of dynamite violence. Hence I discuss works, for the most part, which circulated beyond the immediacy of radical circles: published fiction, essays, and manifestoes; journalistic accounts from the mainstream press; and anarchist memoirs. For analysis of the way anarchism was represented in the mainstream press, see Haia Shpayer-Makov, "Anarchism in British Public Opinion 1880–1914," <span style="font-style:italic;">Victorian Studies</span> 34, no. 4 (Summer 1988): 487–516.</p></div>

Anarchists like Kropotkin saw themselves as guided by "natural science," and bomb technology was a fetish for anarchists, while the public saw in the revolutionary embracing of dynamite something sinister about scientific progress itself.

Tcehernychewsky's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">What's to be Done?</span> . Tchernychewsky was one of the founding theorists of nihilism, and his novel was translated and serialized in radical journals throughout the century (Berkman, for example, used the name Rakhmetoff as his alias in the lead-up to his attempted assassination of Frick). A re of tremendous asceticism and appeal, whose terrorist activities are alluded to only vaguely, Rakhmetoff is created, according to the author's own claims, to show what a truly extraordinary person looks like.

Berkman's masculinism is not unique among male anarchists. Despite anarchism's opposition to social codes and laws, and its affinities with nihilism—a movement with a strong feminist tenet—anarchists often look conventional when it comes to gender. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Under Western Eyes</span>, Conrad elaborates on some of these contradictions, ruthlessly parodying what he views as the hypocrisy of the revolutionists on the subject of female emancipation.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f39" href="#f39-text">39. </a>In later works, we might note, Berkman attempts to mute this furor, and to place violence in a more balanced position with respect to anarchism's goals and methods. As he writes in 1926, "You have heard that Anarchists throw bombs, that they believe in violence, and that Anarchy means disorder and chaos . . . No, my friend, it is capitalism and government which stand for disorder and violence. Anarchism is the very reverse of it; it means order without government and peace without violence" (Alexander Berkman, <span style="font-style:italic;">What is Anarchism?</span> [Edinburgh: AK, 2003], 138).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f53" href="#f53-text">53. </a>Conrad may have been thinking here of a notorious essay published in 1892 in the primary anarchist journal in England, <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, with the suggestive title "An Anarchist Feast at the Opera." The essay gleefully imagined the probable effects of a bomb being exploded in the London opera house, including reflections on the smell of bourgeois flesh burning and the like.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f54" href="#f54-text">54. </a>It seems likely that Conrad came upon the narrative of the Greenwich bombing as the brainchild of the Russian embassy, frustrated with Britain's lax laws and hoping to goad public opinion, from Ford Madox Ford, who appears to have heard such rumors from his anarchist connections. More generally, the problem of <span style="font-style:italic;">agents provacateurs—</span>of identifying and punishing them, and of continuing to function despite their infiltration of the movement—became a preoccupation among anarchists in the 1890s and beyond.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f60" href="#f60-text">60. </a>A number of critics have observed the split quality of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. In an oft-cited critique, Irving Howe argues that the turn to Winnie's drama in the second part of the novel catalyzes a form of parody that turns the whole panorama into a kind of grim urban puppet show (Howe, <span style="font-style:italic;">Politics and the Novel</span>). More recently, two excellent feminist critiques have worked from the observation of a fundamental shift in the novel, in both style and thematics, as the detective novel cedes to the domestic novel. See Wendy Moffat, "Domestic Violence: The Simple Tale within <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">ELT</span> 37, no. 4 : 465-489, and Rishona Zimring, "Conrad's Pornography Shop," <span style="font-style:italic;">MFS</span> 43, no. 2 : 319-348.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f61" href="#f61-text">61. </a>Conrad opens <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> with the issue of protection; as Verloc walks out for his morning interview with Vladimir, he thinks complacently of his own role in protecting the citizens of London. Conrad's irony is palpable in this sequence, yet the notion of "vigilance," which is repeatedly invoked in the novel's opening chapters, taps into a wider Victorian preoccupation with policing, both within the confines of "home" and in the imperial domain. For discussion of these issues, see Miller, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Novel and the Police</span>, David Philips, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crime and Authority in Victorian England: the Black Country, 1835-1860</span> (London: Croom Helm, 1977); Bernard Porter, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origins of the Vigilant State</span> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1987); and Philip Thurmond Smith, <span style="font-style:italic;">Policing Victorian London: Political Policing, Public Order, and the London Metropolitan Police</span> (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1985). With respect to the question of foreignness within the national space, one might point to the scene in the novel in which the Assistant Commissioner wanders through Soho, dining at an Italian restaurant. For discussion of this sequence, see Joseph McLaughlin, <span style="font-style:italic;">Writing the Urban Jungle: Reading Empire in London from Doyle to Eliot</span> (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 2000), 133-167.</p></div>

Cunninghame Graham</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), 169.Zdzislaw Najder makes an interesting case for reading the novel in terms of a subverted—what we might call a deconstructed—melodrama. He writes, for instance: "The narrative . . . goes against the melodramatic grain of the subject matter. The course of action does not resolve the conflicts but makes them more complex and ambiguous; instead of simple contrasts we are faced with manifold deceptions, misunderstandings and ambiguities." What is missing in Najder's generally astute argument is a sense of generic mixture: the search for pure melodrama, or pure irony for that matter, seems quixotic.
