<I>Two copies of this article exist: a typescript of five leaves with a
cover leaf inscribed by Lewis, </I>"The Machine. |<I> </I>typescript for
article. | <I>Wyndham Lewis," and a carbon of the same typescript. The
first is at Buffalo, the second at Cornell. The typing is poor and
inaccurate, and both copies have occasional marks (probably by Mrs. Lewis)
separating words that the typist has run together. The carbon has one
spelling correction, but neither copy has been properly corrected. The
essay was probably written in 1934 or 1935, when Lewis published a series
of articles on industrial art and the machine. The subject was topical
in literature, design, and architecture. Its political side is brought
out most clearly in "Shropshire Lads or Robots Again" and "Power-feeling
and Machine-Age Art."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I> Lewis associates enthusiasm for machinery in the arts with political
enthusiasm for the industrialisation of the Soviet Union and its
accompanying feats of social engineering--enthusiasm in which he did not
share. Lewis's theories of the necessity for human imperfection conflicted
with his modernist utopian ambitions (expressed in the 1919 pamphlet,
</I>The Caliph's Design: Architects! Where is Your Vortex?<I>).</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
<I> Mechanical perfection dissolves human identity. "The Machine"
bears traces of Lewis's admiration of the architecture of the Berbers
of North Africa, whose romantic (and "European") barbarism he praises
in </I>Kasbahs and Soukhs,<I> an unfinished book of the early 1930s,
sections of which are included in </I>Journey into Barbary: Morocco
Writings and Drawings.

<P>
If we confine ourselves to things of which we have ocular
evidence--excluding all modes of life or art that might come about, or
that <I>should</I> come about, or that might have been, or should have
been--then no argument is possible, I think, when those two modes are
contrasted--the human mode and the non-human mode. The human modes are
the better and brighter.

<P>
If by the fiat of a despot a city could be built (such as I imagined in
<I>The Caliph's Design</I> or <I>Architects, Where is Your Vortex</I>) and
if the despot could be so trained and so endowed--his state so rich in
resources, possessing such transcendent workmen, politically so firmly
established etc. etc. etc.--as to ensure a maximum result, in speed,
effort and intelligence, then, of course, the city that would be built
would be second to none in history, it would be far better than any city
ever built.

<P>
But that is a city of <I>Ifs and Ans</I> [<I>sic</I>], for a rather
vulgar streak somewhere in the mind of the despot, for instance, would
be enough to spoil the city.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Meanwhile <I>the human</I> seems to have the advantage of the
 <I>non-human,</I> or the superhuman. Where men have physically been
 able to act the giant, and chop through nature, instead of crawling
 over it, in the manner of Lilliput, and override an accident, instead
 of accommodating themselves to it, they have not been able to supply
 the appropriate <I>mind</I> for the super-body, that is the trouble.

<P>
There are no rules for cities of course: Venice is built upon the
most disadvantageous basis imaginable, a stork of a city: Manhattan
on the other hand depends for its existence upon the rock-mass beneath
it. You might cite Venice as an example of Man imposing his will upon
the waters. But in fact the charm of Venice <I>is</I> the waters,
of course. The obstacle (technically) turns out to be prime factor,
aesthetically. With Manhattan the rock underneath is of no importance
except as a socket and platform. And after all the Earth itself must
always play <I>that</I> role in anything we undertake upon its surface.

<P>
Taking Venice and Manhattan together--the first as a specimen of human
art (typifying a human submission to the natural beauty of the waters),
the second a specimen of the non-human--then, I think, in its heyday
of course, Venice could be the better place, as the Venetian is the
better man.

<P>
So we have to admit it seems to me that at a period when man has not been
powerful enough to transform the accidental dispositions of nature--with
no dynamite to blast, or rock-drills, say--and is compelled to build
the streets of his cities in and out and up and down, inventing, as
he goes along, untried architectural devices, delightful deformities
and structural freaks, then (it is but too plain) the result is more
satisfactory. By following the vast, non-human, lines of nature,
our human arts score their best successes. Projecting his tortuous,
not yet oppressive, geometry, out upon the chaotic superstructures,
being methodic where he can, in the teeth of natural disorder, man is
seen at his best. He then produces something of intellectual as well
as emotional value, which the unadulterated stark geometry of the
Machine-Age precludes.

<P>
It pains me to say this. And I wish I could assert with a propagandist
emphasis that someday the Machine would be put in its place and man rule
over Machine and

<B></B>

 nature alike. But I believe that the problem of <I>scale</I> is at the
 centre of these particular problems of art. It is easier to put the
 soul of a god in the body of a man than vice versa apparently. All
 the Machine so far has done is to <I>enlarge,</I> as you enlarge a
 small photograph. Will it ever be allowed to enlarge, or to multiply,
 anything <I>good?</I> The Machine is able to bloat to a hundred times
 the size something trivial, or repeat in innumerable exemplars something
 foolish. This is what usually it does. When it reproduces the Mona Lisa,
 or Van Gogh's <I>Postman</I> ten thousand times it is doubtful if that
 is an improvement. Should it enlarge it the same number of times it
 would of course be meaningless. The Machine imitates, it enlarges, it
 multiplies, or Man through it. But so far there has been a watering
 down, only, or vulgarising of pre-Machine-Age effort. And this
 of course has coincided with the notion of the supersession of the
 Individual by the Mass. Perhaps the destiny of the Machine is involved
 with the destiny of the Mass?

<P>
Ten thousand dull chair-legs (of Windsor Chair pattern) enlarged a
hundred-fold, and placed in two rows upon Salisbury Plain, would knock
Stonehenge into a cocked hat no doubt. But no question of <I>art</I>
would be involved, any more than in the impact of a giant comet, or, if
you like, in the size of a nebula.

<P>
The Machine has been courted and denounced: but even more important than
the question of the Machine, is the <I>natural</I> fashion in which all
human societies grow and flower and perish. Can a conscious or mechanical
canon be imposed upon them? I have always held that ideally it would
be more satisfactory if this limitation of natural growth--the waxing
and flourishing plant-status--could give place with us to something
more deliberate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
There has to be not only the power, in short (which is conferred upon
society by the development of mechanical technique) but also the <I>will
to invention,</I> to beauty, significance and so forth. China and Japan
are today a terrible object-lesson in how with the Machine comes in
Barbarity.

<P>
Just as the old art (which I have called human art) has derived its
significance from the accidental character of the surface of nature
(without attempting to flatten it out or tidy it up), may not the will
to invent depend also on the brutal accidents of the surface of a given
society, and the accidents, again, of a secluded situation, or a local
and temporary prosperity? Or we can put this in another way. It may
be <I>parasitic upon nature only.</I> Once the social landscape, as it
were, has been humanly flattened out, tidied up, or even has been very
much interfered with, and lost its "primitive"--its human--character,
this parasite may die off, or forget its cunning.

<P>
In the midst of all these speculations, the only thing that is quite
certain is that the various graphic and plastic arts are upon all
hands in a state of decay. In spots, the building art alone is not
quite dead. The Cinema, in its capacity of Kinetic Plastic--or "Moving
Statue," or of moving monochrome picture, or Tableau Vivant--is very
active, certainly, very proselytising and perfervid. But the Cinema
(the only Cinema that counts) is a social doctrine as well as an art I
think. It is far too handy a vehicle for all that is second-rate--as a
mode of expression for people who would be doomed to second-rateness,
and that is failure, in other directions--not to be suspect.

<B></B>

<P>
So what we come back to here is the problem again of the Machine:
for the conquest of the Redskin by the European colonist was not the
conquest of a lower type by a higher necessarily. It was the triumph
of the rifle. Ultimately, it was the triumph of <I>the inventor of the
rifle</I>--not certainly of the people who manufacture or use it. --May
not the Machine play a similar role, destructive of all value and human
significance, in the field of art that it has in the field of politics?

The protagonist of Lewis's 1941 novel, <I>The Vulgar Streak,</I> was
intended as an embodiment, and hence critique, of a Napoleonist dynamic
principle (which, by then, Lewis also associated with Hitler) in European
culture.
