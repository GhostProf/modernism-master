<!--_epigraph-->
Mr. Bell assures us that Mr. Wyndham Lewis's art is practically
independent of "association or suggestion." Obviously if this means
anything it is that this gifted painter's art means nothing. Humanly
speaking it is impossible for a man to picture things that are associated
with nothing, suggested by nothing, and which suggest nothing.

<B>Prologue: Painting and Performance</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Among those blessed in <I>Blast</I> were George Robey, Shirley Kellogg,
Harry Weldon, George Mozart, and Gaby (Deslys).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Wyndham Lewis is nevertheless not a painter we associate with the music
 hall (like Walter Sickert or Spencer Gore). If an affection for certain
 kinds of popular culture (cabaret, revue, boxing, early Chaplin films)
 parallels the interests of cubists and Futurists and sits well with the
 polemics of <I>Blast,</I> it seems to have little to do with the art:
 with <I>Kermesse,</I> for instance, considered one of the first cubist
 paintings in England and "a landmark in the development of modernist
 painting in Britain."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 I want to argue on the contrary that <I>Kermesse</I> and its studies
 were richly suggestive and their associations locatable, and that the
 artist of the modern movement--though he might

<B></B>

see himself as a primitive mercenary in the iron jungle of the modern
city--was also an armchair fl&acirc;neur at the Alhambra who riffled
through the <I>Tatler</I> at the breakfast table. This "enormous,
jangling, journalistic, fairy desert of modern life" was the social and
discursive space of popular entertainment--"of music halls and motor-buses
and women's legs in tights and newspapers and electric sky-signs spelling
out words letter by letter"--rather than the direct expression of the
industrialized modernity that underpinned it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
Lewis dated his maturity as a painter to 1912, to the year of
<I>Kermesse</I> and its studies, the <I>Timon</I> series, and paintings
exhibited at the second Post-Impressionist exhibition, including
<I>Creation</I> and <I>Mother and Child.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 "Kermesse" is the term for a peasant fair or carnival in the Low
 Countries, one characterized by boisterous merry-making.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 <I>Kermesse</I> was important to him: it was very large (nearly nine
 foot square), it was several times repainted and exhibited to some
 r&eacute;clame, and Lewis himself at a moment of sober stocktaking
 considered it the touchstone of his prewar achievement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 It is probably the major loss among his early paintings and Lewis
 would not have balked at its landmark status. But it was more than
 a staging-post en route to abstraction. It was also "of" something,
 something that resides not in "what it depicts or resembles" but in
 what it is "causally related to or determined by"; its imagery and
 modernist handling served Lewis's private purposes as well as his
 professional ambitions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 More generally, the case of Lewis invites us to reconsider the tangled
 relations between popular culture and the prewar avant-gardes. These
 relations are usually conceived in one-way terms as a popular response
 to the avant-garde (where outrage or satire is the sine qua non
 of radical status), or an avant-garde address to the popular (where
 strategic raids on mass culture secure the vigor and modernity of a new
 cultural elite). But something more complicated seems to have gone on,
 something that partially undermined the high/low divide and involved
 the new fashionability both of popular forms like music-hall revue and
 of marginal forms like avant-garde art. Ragtime, Post-Impressionism,
 Futurism, and the tango craze excited a broad slice of the social
 spectrum, jostled for space in the newspapers with suffragette militancy
 and industrial unrest, and were often discussed in reciprocal terms
 ("Futurist politics," "ragtime painting," "anarchy in high art"). Social
 spaces (the salon, the gallery, the music hall, the studio, the bar),
 agents and networks of relations (between colleagues, rivals, patrons,
 critics, curators, dealers), formal and informal institutions and events
 (the Slade, the Caf&eacute; Royal, the Cabaret Theatre Club, the Omega
 Workshops, the Rebel Art Centre, the Post-Impressionist exhibitions,
 Ethel Levey in <I>Hullo Ragtime!,</I> Sergey Diaghilev at Covent Garden,
 F. T. Marinetti at the Coliseum): all these produced a world in which
 subjectivities, social relations, works of art, and aesthetic programs
 were being constantly and reciprocally retuned.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Perhaps this happens anyway, under modern conditions, but the process
 is at this moment newly self-conscious and peculiarly vivid. We can
 neither dissolve the art object back into the full complexity of its
 social context, hoping to rediscover it in its full historicity--context,
 like semiosis, is a story without end--nor offer an exhaustive account
 of its causes inferred from a reading of the object as "effect." In
 the case of Lewis, however,

<B></B>

we can at least track some of the traffic between painting and
performance, between the studio and the outside world (including the
avant-garde as a phenomenon <I>in</I> the public world of newspapers,
cabaret, decor, and fancy dress), between high culture and popular
entertainment, between modernism and masculinity.

<P>
Many of Lewis's prewar works take dance as an explicit theme or a covert
resource, a fact that should be taken a great deal more seriously than it
is. The variety and significance of Edwardian dance forms, however, has
been wildly underrated. The impact of Diaghilev and the Russian Ballet
has been allowed to eclipse the reputations of their contemporaries (many
of them women) and the influence of eurhythmics, popular and vernacular
dance forms, and dance in music-hall revue. Edward Marsh, an early patron
of Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, and Duncan Grant, certainly went to
see Vaslav Nijinsky, but he also went ten times to <I>Hullo Ragtime!</I>
at the Alhambra, often in the company of Rupert Brooke.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 They would have heard Ethel Levey's rendition of <I>Waiting for the
 Robert E. Lee,</I> presumably the inspiration for the painting by
 Christopher Nevinson, reproduced upside down in the <I>Daily Sketch</I>
 in October 1913 ("to show that it doesn't matter"), and described as
 "certainly ragtime art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Marsh was one of those dragooned by Lady Muriel Paget into wearing the
 costumes she had commissioned from Nevinson and Lewis for the Futurism
 tableaux at the Albert Hall Picture Ball in December 1913. That he wore
 such a costume (and what D. H. Lawrence thought about it) we know from
 his biography, but the little we know of its appearance derives from
 photographs published in the <I>Sketch.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P>
It is now a commonplace that the early years of the twentieth century
were marked by accelerating modernization in all the technological and
social meanings of the term and that a single generation encountered the
internal combustion engine, the radio, the telephone, the gramophone,
aeroplanes, and the cinema. One of the less remarked but more influential
developments was the introduction of photography into the mass-circulation
dailies and weeklies of the period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 These had always been illustrated, if at all, with engravings. The
 half-tone reproduction process brought not just a change of technique
 but a change in content and impact. The photograph had a different
 kind of detail and immediacy, and lent itself to that promiscuous
 collage of items that makes up the substance of magazines like the
 <I>Tatler,</I> the <I>Bystander,</I> or the <I>Sketch.</I> This
 immediacy was enhanced in contemporary advertising and in the cinema
 <I>actualit&eacute;s</I> that formed a popular part of the music-hall
 program, and it was exploited both by the "invented traditions" of
 the establishment and the political tactics of contemporary pressure
 groups. This new photographic hegemony, if we can call it that, marks
 a key moment in the consolidation of a spectacular society: not just a
 society saturated with images, or with spectacles of different kinds--the
 audience for which was massively extended by photographic reproduction,
 mass literacy, and the huge circulations of the halfpenny papers--but a
 "society of the spectacle" in Guy Debord's sense, a society in which
 social relations are mediated through spectacle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P>
Art--although in many debates a term that acted as a repository for
everything immutable and transcendent, the principal signifier of what
could <I>not</I> be brought down to the terms of technological progress
or the vested interests of politics or the

<B></B>

marketplace--was itself caught up in the processes of modernization (and
modern reproduction). Avant-garde artists particularly, shorn of the
forms of patronage that kept society portraitists, the genre painters,
academicians--or for that matter the New English Art Club--afloat,
nevertheless had to make their reputations and their livings. They were
notorious in a new way, partly by accident and partly by design, partly
because their works confounded established criteria of competence and
partly because they were (prepared to be) fodder for a voracious press
that could now print photographs of their paintings, sometimes sideways
or upside down. "Modern art" became a subcategory of the editor's
repertoire of humorous, topical, or scandalous images, and labels like
"Post-Impressionist," "cubist," or "Futurist" caused "copy to foam up
under the pen like paper in a conjurer's hat to overflowing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
At the same time as artists like Lewis reacted to what they perceived
as the "feminization" and "bourgeoisification" of art--and perhaps for
this reason--they were seeking a living from wealthy, aristocratic,
female patrons, some of them not averse to a certain butch allure, who
wanted dining rooms, fancy dresses, and party favors in avant-garde
styles. Contrary to the popular trope of the embattled avant-garde, the
avant-garde was briefly and--on certain terms, it is true--fashionable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Nevinson refers to lectures and soir&eacute;es attended by prewar
 Society and "one hundred and one Guardees and Guinnesses";
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 and Lewis to the years when "Coronetted envelopes showered into my
 letter-box."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 In the <I>Tatler</I> the avant-garde rubs shoulders with the aristocracy,
 with sportsmen and adventurers, popular entertainers, dancers, and
 music-hall artists. Futurism, in effect, offered to broker relations
 between them. It produced a frenzied, self-consciously modern imagery
 of railway stations and states of mind, of <I>Waiting for the Robert
 E. Lee</I> or <I>The Pan-Pan Dance at the Monico.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 It transformed the avant-garde artist into a sportsman-adventurer in
 the grip of technophiliac lust--a new prototype of masculinity roaring
 away from the fin de si&egrave;cle in a gobble and whirr of pistons
 and propellers--and simultaneously into

<B></B>

a performer (even a music-hall performer) in an ambiguous embrace of
the demotic. Futurism offered newspaper readers a new entertainment,
entertainers a topic for popular satire, the avant-garde a newly bombastic
self-image, and a few aristocratic patrons a celebrity based not on birth,
wealth, or attainment but on consumption and taste: an identity, indeed,
derived from association with the avant-garde and from <I>being seen</I>
as a consumer of outr&eacute; commodities in the popular press. For
those who chose to respond to it, from principle or expediency, this
was a new, if compromised, space in which to operate.

We can bring these relations into sharper focus by looking at the studies
associated with <I>Kermesse</I>--the painting itself was sold at auction
in 1927 and disappeared after 1930--and at the kinds of performance in
which they were implicated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Take, first, Lewis's <I>Lovers</I> (<A
 HREF="4.2tickner_1.html"> 1</A>), a work on paper of 1912,
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 and its remarkable similarity to a photograph published in
 J. E. Crawford Flitch's <I>Modern Dancing and Dancers</I> (<A
 HREF="4.2tickner_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Lewis's image may have been based on the photographs in Flitch,
 and certainly they reference the same event and the same way of
 choreographing relations between couples who in Lewis's title are
 specifically "Lovers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 But in what sense are studies like <I>Lovers</I>--including the Yale
 <I>Kermesse</I> (M72), <I>Design for a Programme Cover--Kermesse</I>
 (M52), and <I>The Dancers </I>(Study for <I>Kermesse?</I>)--"of" the
 dance? And of which dance? And what was the referent and work of "the
 dance" in Lewis's pictorial strategies?

<P>
The Flitch illustration is a photograph of Fred Farren and Beatrice
Collier performing the "Danse des Apaches" from <I>A Day in Paris,</I>
a ballet that opened at the Empire music hall in London on 19 October
1908 and continued well into 1909.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Paris was easily accessible yet peculiarly exotic: a place where tourism
 was not just a

<B></B>

matter of viewing the principal monuments, collections, and promenades,
but of experiencing a social and sexual geography of brasseries,
caf&eacute;s, markets, studios, dance halls, music halls and cabarets,
all of them linked to an ethnography of writers, painters, students,
dancers, clowns, prostitutes, gangsters, and grisettes. <I>A Day in
Paris</I> revelled in the tourist's city. Its scenes were set in the Place
de l'Op&eacute;ra, on the quais, in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, outside
the Moulin Rouge, and inside the Artists' Ball. Its cast of characters
included a panoply of Parisian types and the Bullivant Smiths, tourists
from Brixton, whose visit provided the narrative conceit. The audience
could revel in the myth of "Gay Paree"--the Paris of <I>Trilby,</I> the
Moulin Rouge, and <I>La Vie de Boh&egrave;me</I>--or affect a knowing
distance from it by finding the tourists amusing. As Max Beerbohm
observed in his column in the <I>Saturday Review,</I> Paris was now a
pasteboard parody of its former glories: "All reality seems to have gone
out of it, leaving only a hard artificial glare for the bedazzlement of
tourists." It was "less like a city than a stage set": bohemia was dead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P>
The sensation of the evening was the "Danse des Apaches." The <I>Times</I>
suggested that "for this alone <I>A Day in Paris</I> is well worth
seeing"; it was rapidly written up, photographed, and caricatured in
the press, in addition to being widely imitated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 (By February 1909, the <I>Tatler</I> observed that "at the present
 time--such is the penalty of success--the apache dance finds a place
 on nearly every music-hall programme throughout the country.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 More securely to the point, perhaps, than the comparison of
 <I>Lovers</I> with the photograph in Flitch, is the parallel between
 Lewis's characteristic aura of erotic menace and this account of the
 dance's emotional temperature:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The cold, compelling cruelty of everything he did, the calculated
brutality to the girl who adored him for it, was a thing of great
artistry, because the passion of the man for the girl he half strangled
and threw about, was allowed to throb through in the most subtle and
amazing way. Every movement, every poise, every piece of seeming brutality
registered and was from the miming and dancing point of view, a work of
art . . . such things come but once in a lifetime and the Apache Dance
filled the Empire for months and still glows in the memory.

<P>
"Apaches" was a term coined in 1902 by the journalist Authur Dupin for
the "savages" of the Parisian underclass: tribes of unemployed, violent,
criminal hooligans with "the manners of the apaches, of the Far-West,
the native scum of our civilisation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 In the early months of 1902 the headlines were filled with the vendetta
 between Manda and Leca, the leaders of rival apache bands, and in
 particular with accounts of an affray in broad daylight on 5 January,
 which left the rue Planchat splattered with blood and strewn with
 knives, axes, and revolvers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Lewis himself lived for several years in the vicinity of the Montparnasse
 territory fought over by the gangs of <I>"la Mouffe" </I>and <I>"la
 Maube." </I>Like Augustus John and Christopher Nevinson (known in
 Montmartre as <I>"l'apache qui rit"</I> [<I>PP,</I> 65]), he had
 first-hand knowledge of the Paris apaches.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 In <I>Blast</I> Lewis blessed Paris specifically for the "BALLADS of
 its PREHISTORIC APACHE Superb hardness and hardiesse of its Voyou type,
 rebellious adolescent" (an implicit riposte to the "BRITANNIC AESTHETE
 . . .

<B></B>

SNEAK AND SWOT OF THE SCHOOL-ROOM").
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 But the image of <I>Lovers</I> comes via the stage, not direct from
 the street.

<P>
From 1902 to 1914 the Parisian papers were constantly exercised by the
problem of apaches. A major campaign in <I>Le Matin</I> (probably intended
to counter liberal moves to abolish the guillotine) peaked in 1907.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In 1907 and 1908 Lewis was living in Paris while Max Dearly was
 choreographing his new <I>Revue de la femme.</I> The apaches in a
 sense were already "spectacular": each band distinguished itself in a
 particular way, though sharing a propensity for peaked caps or melon
 hats, pomaded hair and kiss-curls, collarless shirts with vivid silk
 neckerchiefs, and elaborate footwear (<I>CO,</I> 40). The violent,
 amoral, and flamboyant re of the apache condensed a range of
 social anxieties while offering what the image of the gangster has
 always offered: a seductive, unfettered masculinity, the revenge of
 the outcast on bourgeois propriety. Manda, Leca, and Am&eacute;lie
 H&eacute;lie ("Casque d'Or"), the object of their affections, became
 household names and even folk-heroes. The <I>beau monde</I> flocked to
 see Leca and his apaches arrive at the cabaret of Le Bruyant Alexandre
 where Casque d'Or had been booked as a chanteuse. The Bouffes-du-Nord
 offered her a contract to star in a production of <I>Casque d'Or et les
 Apaches.</I> She was painted by Albert Dupr&eacute; for the Salon and
 photographed by the Pirou studios for portrait <I>cartes de visite</I>
 wearing a pearl-grey costume and ostrich-feather hat. Her memoirs were
 published in serial form in the fortnightly <I>Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle.</I>
 She had a starring role at the trial of Manda and his associates in
 May 1902, when the elegance of the public galleries rivalled that of
 a theatrical first night.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P>
The apaches shared with even impoverished working-class Parisians a
passion for dancing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 The <I>bals</I> of Montmartre and Montparnasse were legendary. What
 became known as the <I>danse des apaches</I> was not, however,
 the vernacular expression of a Parisian subculture, despite being
 occasionally taken as such. In fact it was wholly the invention of Max
 Dearly for a revue at the Moulin Rouge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 He danced it with Mistinguett, the stage name for Jean Bourgeois, as part
 of a show called <I>La Revue de la femme,</I> starting a vogue that first
 reached London in Fred Farren's choreography for <I>A Day in Paris</I>
 in 1908, in a scene set in the Moulin Rouge, and lasted into the 1950s.

<P>
Dearly's choreography, and its English and American adaptations, focused
new anxieties concerning the numbers, effects, and supposed tribal
organization of the Parisian underclass through the Manda-Leca-Casque
d'Or geometry of the sexual triangle. The notoriety of the apaches
and the public clamor surrounding them was condensed into a drama of
Montagues and Capulets in modern dress, a self-conscious update of <I>La
Vie de Boh&egrave;me.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The <I>Tatler</I> described the apache dance as the dance of the
 Parisian hooligan, "the degenerate, half-mad creature which seems to
 be a product of the twentieth-century civilisation"; and Flitch, who
 considered Farren's adaptation of it his finest achievement, praised
 Mistinguett as "a dancer who has brought into the dance all the nervous
 excitement of modernity" (<I>MD,</I> 183).
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

SRC="button/4.2tickner_3b.gif"></A>

The crimes of passion enacted in the apache dance were "savage" insofar
as they represented the antithesis of bourgeois concepts of love and
sexuality--illicit, sadistic, explicit, vengeful, and wildly disruptive
(<A HREF="4.2tickner_3.html"> 3</A>). The choreography represented

<B></B>

the antithesis of the Romantic ballet tradition and of "classical" dancing
on the London stage. It is not necessary to rely on photographs for a
sense of it, since several fragments of film survive. A brief extract
from Path&eacute;'s <I>L'Empreinte, ou, la Main Rouge</I>  clearly
shows Dearly and Mistinguett, dancing in a wine cellar to an accordianist
before an impromptu audience of local Parisians joined, significantly,
by two slumming, top-hatted, fur-collared bourgeois and a fashionably
dressed woman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The movements are violently acrobatic and erotic, miming extremes of
 attraction and repulsion: the woman is literally

<B></B>

thrown around by the man, threatened by him (at one moment he simulates
garrotting, with his forearm across her throat), and, in a defining
gesture, pulled down backwards by her hair. Casque d'Or, in her memoirs,
dismisses pallid, milk-sop notions of bourgeois romance and explicitly
celebrates the exaction of a blood tribute from her admirers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 But the dance is usually a pas de deux, in which the jealous rival is
 presumed to be offstage. It ends violently, often with the murder of the
 girl, but in any case with the reassertion of masculine power over her
 fickle and disruptive sexuality. In illustrations the male is always
 dark and unshaven, with a cap, muffler, and sometimes a dagger, while
 the woman has a flared, ankle-length skirt, and a necktie by which she
 is whirled around. These movements and accessories were the defining
 elements of the apache image, not as it existed in its local variety, but
 as it was reduced and condensed for the cinema, the stage, contemporary
 photographs and caricatures, and as a popular form of fancy dress.

If we miss that cap and muffler and the contemporary resonance of
those sequential poses--the complex of allusions to the social reality,
mythology, and popular choreography of the apaches--we miss the narratives
of violence and sexual jealousy that fuel an image like <I>Lovers,</I>
an image nevertheless frozen and <I>staged</I> in its geometries. In the
end this image is not located on the street but at the Moulin Rouge,
the Empire, the Alhambra, the Coliseum, or the Palace, and identities
that were already to a high degree performative have been tamed and
transformed into a commodified spectacle for the music-hall stage. The
shift from the whirling forms of popular caricature, as in the work of
H. M. Bateman (<A HREF="4.2tickner_4.html"> 4</A>), into the
angular vocabulary of cubo-futurism, is also expressive. The jagged
shapes of <I>Lovers </I>have work to do, sliding

<B></B>

ambiguously between reference and abstraction. The splintered facets on
the left, for instance, framing the corners at top and bottom, evoke,
subliminally, the top-hatted head and shoulder of a looming spectator;
alternatively, the torpedo-shape in the bottom left corner seems to
contain a viewer seen from above, and a tautly elliptical phallus
thrusting vigorously into the back of the woman on the left presses
her into the rough embrace of her partner, underwriting the sexual
tensions in more rative elements of the drawing. The work is partly
<I>about</I> this self-conscious restaging of modern sexualities, in
which the apache stands as a local and contemporary manifestation of an
atavistic masculinity, and as the screen for projective identifications
on the part of a (very bourgeois and masculine) avant-garde subjectivity,
one in flight from nineteenth-century bourgeois proprieties and in pursuit
of an emancipated, twentieth-century sexual identity and experience.

<P>
The ambience of the music hall features here too, as a particular kind
of social space and a particular kind of pictorial subject. R. Belfort,
describing the Empire in 1902, observed that "aristocrats, artists,
bourgeois, students, provincials, foreigners and 'the man in the street'
form component parts of the Empire public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Many were connoisseurs of variety turns and, especially, ballet but
 at least some derived part of their pleasure from the social mix and
 the sexual attractions of stage and promenade. What distinguished the
 music hall from the legitimate theater was the nature of the acts, the
 availability of drink, and the opportunity of circulating during the
 performance. This encouraged a volatile, well-oiled, participatory
 audience, and a link to prostitution. Halls like the Empire and the
 Alhambra (both in Leicester Square) were located in areas well known
 for soliciting. The Empire "Promenade," in particular, was notorious as
 the haunt of prostitutes and an informal club for "colonial officials,
 soldiers, civil servants, 'advanced' clergymen . . . the aristocracy,
 young bloods, Bohemians, and ordinary music-hall goers"--all attracted by
 what Compton Mackenzie nostalgically recalled as "peripatetic harlotry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P>
The taint, or promise, of sexuality caused an outcry when Walter Sickert
exhibited <I>Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties: Second Turn of Miss
Katie Lawrence</I> in 1888.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Sickert was no doubt stimulated by contact with Edgar Degas and scenes
 of urban entertainment in France. Until then, as Anna Robins points
 out, the halls were celebrated in literary circles but not depicted by
 the Victorian painters of modern life. Sickert in turn inspired Spencer
 Gore, who began a series of studies of music-hall and ballet subjects
 at the Old Bedford and the Alhambra in 1906.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Both artists depict the audience against a brightly lit stage or up in
 the gallery. Sickert offers a <I>com&eacute;die humaine</I> and Gore a
 rendering of the artificial brilliance of performance itself; they seem
 a world away from Lewis and <I>Lovers</I> (although Lewis was friendly
 with Gore and wrote his obituary in <I>Blast,</I> praising him over
 Degas for his "scenes from the London music-halls [which] brought to
 light a new world of witty illusion").
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The influence of cubism and Futurism lies between them but also something
 more: Lewis's detachment and antihumanism: the artist cannot be "of" the
 scene or even portray it with human warmth. But <I>Lovers</I> belongs
 to the tradition of Degas, Sickert, and Gore, albeit tangentially. Lewis
 made the connection himself.

<B></B>

The transformation of the tradition was not a matter of the flight to
abstraction--"the particular transcripts you make will respond to some
personal and logical vision, or the abstract arrangements will have
their direct parallel in Nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 It was a matter of short-circuiting the connection between inner vision
 and outer motif. "D&eacute;gas would be getting in the Poulailler [the
 gallery] and gaze down on actors' heads, or get next the orchestra
 and stare up at them, to induce Nature to supply a simulance of his
 vision. We to-day dispense more or less with these acrobatics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Lewis had seen his dancers but had not directly transcribed them, or
 that was the claim: they were inside his head.

<B>The Cabaret Theatre Club, 1912: <I>Kermesse</I></B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Four years separate <I>Lovers</I> from <I>A Day in Paris.</I> The strong
but speculative argument is that Flitch's 1912 reproduction of Farren
and Collier's 1908 performance is the link that brings them together. The
weaker but less contentious claim is that there was a rich vein of apache
references in popular culture before and after 1912--apache dancers,
apache balls, apache films, apache costumes in the fancy-dress craze--on
which <I>Lovers</I> draws, but with an affect peculiar to Lewis's private
concerns. The immediate impetus for <I>Lovers,</I> as for <I>Kermesse,</I>
lies in the coincidence of two events in the spring of 1912: the first
London exhibition of Futurist paintings at the Sackville Gallery in
March, and Madame Frida Uhl Strindberg's plans for a cabaret called the
Cave of the Golden Calf or Cabaret Theatre Club, published in April.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

<P>
The "Preliminary Prospectus" of the Cave promised an interior "entirely
and exclusively decorated" by "leading young British artists." The
cabaret would embrace "On one hand such art as we owe to the genius of
the people, the dance, folk lore--on the other offering free development
to the youngest and best of our contemporaries and--'Futurists'"
(<I>ABG,</I> 63).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Gore was put in charge of decorations, and Lewis was a leading
 contributor. Through them the cabaret drew into its more exclusive and
 self-conscious ambience a tradition of painterly engagement with music
 hall and revue, a tradition now redefined as Futurist for reasons of
 modernist credibility. Dance was a common emblem of emancipation and
 even, in its contentious new forms, of sexual licence. It made a suitable
 theme for a venue taking its title from the Biblical narrative of Moses
 and the Golden Calf, hinting none too subtly at pagan orgies and drunken
 revelry. The Cave staged everything from flamenco and tarantella to
 "classical," "nautch," "veil," and "coster" dances. It offered tango
 teas and champagne suppers; in the small hours it was, according to
 Osbert Sitwell, "a super-heated Vorticist garden of gesticulating
 res, dancing and talking while the rhythm of the primitive forms
 of ragtime throbbed through the wide room."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Dance was also prominent at the Sackville Gallery, where the most popular
 works were the Futurist Gino Severini's <I>Blue Dancer</I> and <I>The
 Pan-Pan Dance at the Monico.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 The impact of Futurism was critical for Lewis, if often denied. It
 can be traced obliquely, in the impress of comparable handling or
 themes, and even in the force of denial itself. The use of blue in
 the <I>Kermesse</I> studies might alert us to it (as a nod to <I>Blue
 Dancer</I> or,

<B></B>

somewhat sarcastically, in the direction of precubist Picasso); or what
is perhaps a reworking of Severini's <I>Pan-Pan Dance</I>--a cheerful,
urbane, kaleidoscopic, picture-puzzle--into something whirling, darker,
fractured, and menacing like the Yale <I>Kermesse.</I> The precise
dates within 1912 are not secure, so nothing is sure, but I am arguing
that a confluence of rivalry and patronage provoked <I>Kermesse</I> and
its associated studies, a rivalry sparked by the challenge of Futurism,
even <I>Blue Dancer,</I> and patronage secured with the commission for
the Cave.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P>
Cabaret developed in France, out of the caf&eacute; concert.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Originally rooted in the more or less private and spontaneous exchanges
 of writers and poets, during the 1880s and 1890s cabaret was transformed
 through the efforts of entrepreneurs and performers like Rodolph Salis
 (at the Chat Noir) and Aristide Bruant (at Le Mirliton) into an intimate
 but public entertainment, by turns literary, dramatic, satirical,
 scabrous, sentimental, and demotic. Half a dozen cabarets are listed in
 the 1907 Paris Baedeker, including the <I>"cabarets illusionnistes"</I>
 on the Boulevard Clichy: the Cabaret de l'Enfer, the Cabaret du Ciel,
 and the Cabaret du N&eacute;ant, but tourists are warned that their
 songs, mystic illusions, and shadow-plays "presuppose a considerable
 knowledge of colloquial French" and "are scarcely suitable for ladies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Already in 1905, one commentator had observed that the local cabarets
 have "long since ceased to attract the Montmartrois, and are kept up
 as mere show places for provincial and foreign tourists" (like the
 Bullevant Smiths in <I>A Day in Paris</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 After 1900, however, cabaret was increasingly taken up by the avant-garde
 and diffused across Europe. While its passing or dilution was mourned
 in Paris, new cabarets were opened in Berlin, Barcelona, Munich, Cracow,
 Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Zurich. Italy and England are absent from the
 list because in Italy the place of cabaret was to some extent taken by
 Futurism, while in England cabaret was "alien from its very inception."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 This was the view early in 1912 of Francis Toye in the <I>Bystander:</I>
 satire was the lifeblood of cabaret and satire (and shameless
 chansonniers) were precluded by English good taste. Cabaret would
 never transplant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 But only two months later he offered a warm if cautious reception to
 the Cave of the Golden Calf, and the <I>Times</I> concluded that the
 cabaret habit was finally taking root in London.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P>
Mme. Strindberg embraced avant-garde art and artists with unfeigned
enthusiasm, but undoubtedly her "futurist" d&eacute;cor was good for
publicity and publicity was good--in fact was a precondition--for
the avant-garde. It was a two-way street. Cabaret interiors, informal
and eclectic, had signalled their bohemianism with artists' posters,
paintings, and signboards, ever since Salis and Bruant had shown work
by Th&eacute;ophile Steinlen, Jules Cheret, and Toulouse-Lautrec. The
actual Golden Calf in the Cave, Eric Gill's household pet and tutelary
presence, was prered in Steinlen's signboard for the Chat Noir,
in the stained-glass window of the Golden Calf that Salis commissioned
for the club's new premises in 1885, and by the huge golden pig in the
Cabaret du Ciel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 The promise of an artistic ambience was part of the cabaret's
 attraction for its social mix: "artists, writers, poets, East-end Jews,
 men-about-town, dancers, <I>cocottes</I> and all the rest of them," as
 Nevinson described the customers at the Crab Tree Club (<I>PP,</I> 62).
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Mme. Strindberg's promotional literature linked the

<B></B>

cabaret and the music hall to the Futurists as sources of inspiration;
she praised variety as "the natural form of art" or "at least a perennial
expression of artistic temperament" and promised that her new cabaret
would encourage "art in this spontaneous and flexible form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 For their part artists could earn some money (a pressing need),
 socialize, manifesto-ize, and inhale what we have come to call the
 oxygen of publicity. (Lewis confessed that although the Cabaret was
 "the cause of so many ridiculous vexations to me. . . . it serves to
 fill up the necessary gaps financially" [<I>L,</I> 46]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>

<P>
Lewis's contribution to the Cave was extensive. An unsigned note in
the Cornell archives from Mme. Strindberg offers him payment for two
paintings, a pair of screens, and the arrangement and decoration of
the walls.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 In a later memoir he refers to "the somewhat abstract hieroglyphics I
 had painted round the walls, [which] with the impassioned orchestra
 . . . must have provided a kick or two for the young man about town
 of the moment," adding that it was his first job: "I did not receive
 a great deal for my night-club murals (actually &#163;60). I was quite
 unknown, however, and would have done them for nothing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 He also painted the drop-curtain (still wet on the opening night),
 designed posters, menus, envelopes, and various pieces of printed
 ephemera, and contributed a "Painter-Poet's Night" of <I>ombres
 chinoises</I> ("chinese shadows," or shadow plays) in 1913.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Most importantly, he also contributed <I>Kermesse,</I> which hung on
 the stairs like a preface to the revelry below.

<P>
The only remaining record of this nine-foot painting is a drypoint
by Horace Brodzky, about the size of a postcard, called <I>Viewing
Kermesse,</I> from an exhibition in New York in 1917.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 At an earlier exhibition (the Allied Artists' Association in 1912),
 Roger Fry had praised it as the only work to survive the ordeal of
 being hung in the ample surroundings of the Albert Hall, and both Fry
 and Clive Bell, in contemporary reviews, had advised the viewer to take
 the lift to the gallery, from which vantage "He will be able to judge
 [it] as he would judge music--that is to say as pure formal composition"
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 and "abstract harmony."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Brodzky's viewer looks at an easel painting that he is encouraged to
 read formally, framed by the gallery context and by a critical discourse
 adapting Walter Pater's dictum that "all art aspires to the condition
 of music" to modernist ends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 This was not, however, the painting's original form or context at the
 Cabaret Theatre Club. Brodzky's viewer did not see the <I>same</I>
 painting that Lewis had painted in 1912, not only because Lewis had
 changed it, but because the cabaret itself produced a different kind of
 audience. This audience was socially mixed; self-consciously bohemian;
 seated at tables or milling around; out to enjoy itself talking,
 flirting, eating, drinking, smoking, and dancing; engaged with the
 spectacle on stage and off; it occupied to the full the senses of
 its <I>social</I> body, with art as backdrop--the very antithesis
 of the gallery's contemplative, even critical, "eye." Augustus John,
 Lewis's erstwhile mentor, wrote that he was "greatly impressed by your
 picture. . . . In spite of the perplexing and unaccustomed elements of
 the design I recognize the energy and grandeur of the conception and
 am positively moved by it as to the beating of drums and blowing of
 horns and thumping of feet."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Sickert, who was sceptical of Lewis's more abstract work, suggested
 that for a real sense of his talent "one should see the decoration he
 has done for a night club called

<B></B>

the Cabaret. For a club where you go to dance the tango or to have other
amusement, this is just the right form of decoration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>

<P>
Reviewing his work in a letter to Ezra Pound in 1916, Lewis remarked
that <I>Kermesse</I> (in its "primitive state") had been "praised by
Roger Fry in 'the Nation,' [and then] John wrote 'thanking me' for it
etc. But even for a wall painting it is too uncouth and its unfinished
state would not recommend it to the very discriminating, <I>with which
ideal audience we must always suppose we are dealing.</I>" (<I>L,</I>
79, emphasis Lewis's). Collectively, the Cave's customers might not
have been Lewis's ideal audience, and the discriminating among them less
distracted in a gallery. But renting <I>Kermesse</I> to Mme. Strindberg
(who retained an option to purchase as part of the contract) kept Lewis in
the company of artists such as Jacob Epstein, Harold Gilman, Eric Gill,
and Gore, not to mention patrons like Ford Madox Ford and Osbert Sitwell
(later owner of <I>Lovers</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 It kept Lewis, "futurism," and the cabaret itself in the public eye;
 it framed <I>Kermesse</I> in particular ways, not necessarily to its
 disadvantage, as part of the new traffic between the avant-garde,
 performers, and entrepreneurs; and it displayed the work to a mixed
 clientele of artists, writers, actors, bohemians, aristocrats, and the
 Brigade of Guards.

<P>
Something of the flavor of the club and a sense of its checkered fortunes
can be gained (with caution) from its lightly fictionalized appearances
in three contemporary novels: Charles Marriott's <I>Subsoil</I> ,
where it res as the Rocking Horse Club; Gilbert Cannan's <I>Mendel</I>
, where it is called the Merlin's Cave; and Ford Madox Ford's
<I>The Marsden Case</I> (set in 1914 but published in 1923), where it
appears as the Night Club.

<P>
In <I>Subsoil</I> the Rocking Horse is "a Bohemian club, in the style of
Montmartre. . . . furnished as a caf&eacute; restaurant, and freakishly
decorated."
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 It has been started with wealthy patronage as a rallying place for "the
 younger and more experimental painters and writers of London" (<I>S,</I>
 9). But Marriott's hero, Hugh Sutherland, one of its decorators and a
 founding member, is already suspicious of its success with the newspapers
 and distrustful of those who insist "on the possibility of Bohemia in
 evening-dress" (<I>S,</I> 10). Publicity was a contested value. The
 Cabaret Theatre Club vaunted its uniquely congenial surroundings for
 artists and art lovers, citing "an eminent art critic" who had praised
 its interior as the "most notable attempt in England to apply the new
 artistic gospel to permanent mural decoration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Within the novel, however, Sutherland feels that the club has been
 betrayed into the hands of traders and philistines. His acquaintance,
 Valentine Saffery, observes that they "regard us as truffle-hogs, nosing
 out the refinements of pleasure they haven't the wit to discover for
 themselves" (<I>S,</I> 16). Sutherland himself, having designed a panel
 for the club, regrets the company it keeps:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[It] represented a procession of dancing-girls, of a type suggested to him
by some Cretan rines in the British Museum, with hour-glass waists,
exaggerated hips, and breasts enormously enlarged and amalgamated by
upward pressure. While painting it, he had been inspired by the idea of
the factitious and meretricious as right for the atmosphere of the place,
as well as by the way the queerly distorted res lent themselves to
the suggestion

<B></B>

 of rhythmical movement. Now he realised how a purely artistic intention
 could be misinterpreted . . . [by] the dirty innuendo of the Philistine,
 sniffing corruption. [<I>S,</I> 22-23]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Bohemia has become "a sort of game preserve for the wealthy classes"
(<I>S,</I> 315), and images of pimps and procurement hover in Marriott's
text as metaphors for the prostitution of art by dealers, by fashionable,
shallow, and sensation-seeking patrons, and by an opportunistic
avant-garde.

<P>
While Marriott's reservations may owe something to his Arts-and-Crafts
Christian Socialism, and a certain reforming zeal, a similar complaint
is made by the characters in Gilbert Cannan's <I>Mendel.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 At the Merlin's Cave, the painters Logan and Mendel
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 find a commissionaire at the door, a book to be signed, and silk-lined
 overcoats and opera hats in the cloakroom. Two young men in immaculate
 evening dress follow them in, looking "slightly self-conscious and
 ashamed of themselves" (<I>M,</I> 236), and Mendel wonders, "Why did they
 come there if they were ashamed? and why did they expect an Asmodean
 lewdness of an artists' club, they for whom the flesh-markets of the
 music-hall promenades existed?" (<I>M,</I> 236) When Mendel's friend and
 model Jessie Petrie asks him what he thinks of the place--"I suppose if
 the swells come it'll be a success, but they do spoil it"--he agrees,
 "Yes. They spoil everything" (<I>M,</I> 238).

<P>
Ford Madox Ford, describing 1914 from the distance of 1923, is more
benign. Mme. Strindberg is "a kind, voluptuous, abstracted creature
. . . very benevolent to innumerable young men with steeple-crowned hats
and black side whiskers"
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 and someone who, as he counselled the exasperated Lewis in 1913,
 "is trying to build up a palace of all the Arts with three oyster
 shells and stale patchouli and sawdust and creme and verse libre and
 champagne corks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Ford later recalled writing a shadow-play for the Cabaret--<I>ombres
 chinoises</I> had been one of the glories of the Chat Noir
<BR>
--and it is tempting to see it as the basis for his account of the
shadow-play in <I>The Marsden Case.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 The narrator is sunk at his marble table during the preparations;
 the young man who has designed the silhouettes passes "swiftly before
 the screen, a cardboard box beneath his cape, himself a silhouette"
 (<I>MC,</I> 90); and then the lights are switched on, revealing
 "a terrific white wooden pillar like a beaked man with a scarlet
 tongue" (<I>MC,</I> 92), and all around white caryatids with "scarlet
 details, the heads of hawks, cats, camels, and the white of their paint
 [giving] small shining reflections" (<I>MC,</I> 92). Clarice Honeywill,
 a diseuse who is "a true Tragic muse with an awful voice in which every
 word [is] clearer than type," performs while "non-representational
 snakes, assassins, and harem-grilles" (<I>MC,</I> 128) wriggle across
 the illuminated sheet. She brings the house down. The "Guardees and
 stockbrokers and German Jews" (<I>MC,</I> 129) demand an encore, and
 London loses "a great diseuse" (<I>MC,</I> 130), as she is "swept
 up into the footlights of blessed and stereotyped inanities and did
 the same thing night after night for a thousand nights, literally"
 (<I>MC,</I> 130).
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 And we will never know if Lewis was the young man in the cape, and if
 this was the same occasion as his "Painter-Poet's Night" in October
 1913, an event that led him to write to his friend Cuthbert Hamilton
 of the "shadow-picture bustle" and of his concern that the "beastly
 Cabaret, that has been the cause of so many ridiculous vexations to me,
 . . . [should not] add lessening of our good camaraderie to the number
 of its senseless misdeeds" (<I>L,</I> 46).

Early in 1914 the club closed down. There had been financial difficulties
and the artists had not been paid. (In April 1913 Mme. Strindberg offered
Ginner and Gore her Augustus John paintings, drawings, and etchings in
settlement of &#163;535, once she had un-mortgaged them; Lewis took his
money out of the till.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 The club's minute books make mysterious references to libels and
 scandals, and the club was raided by police because nonmembers were
 purchasing food and drink in breach of the regulations. A creditors'
 meeting had been arranged as early as July 1913, but Mme. Strindberg
 seems to have evaded the noose until February 1914, when a liquidation
 sale took place. (The furniture was sold for &#163;80 and the "good
 will" for &#163;10 [<I>ABG,</I> 113].)
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 In April 1914, apparently still trading, she was fined &#163;160 with
 the option of two month's imprisonment for selling wine, beer, spirits,
 and tobacco without a licence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 In May the same magistrate, for the same offence, "ordered the Cabaret
 Club to be struck off the register, and directed that the premises
 should not be used as a club for the next five years."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>

<P>
The <I>Sketch</I> ran a series on the new supper clubs for dining and
tango dancing (the Lotus, Murray's, and the Four Hundred Club), but
there were no outr&eacute; decorations, no cabaret turns, no avant-garde
company. This was followed in July by an article on the Crab Tree Club,
on Greek Street, with which John was associated. This was artier than
the supper clubs and full of young women with bobbed hair and red
neckerchiefs, but only as masquerade.
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>
 In April, on the rebound from the Cabaret Theatre Club and the Omega
 Workshops, Lewis founded the Rebel Art Centre with Kate Lechmere, whose
 idea it was, as codirector and source of capital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 The Cubist Art Centre, as it was also known, was several things
 at once. It was an art school (costing five guineas a quarter; with
 instruction in various applied arts including the painting of screens,
 fans, lampshades, and scarves available if required; Mr. Lewis to
 visit as professor five days a week). It was a workshop for painters
 and craftsmen who could "bring their work and go on with it, if this
 atmosphere is congenial. . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 It was a place for lectures, performances, and public discussion, with
 talks to be given by Pound and Marinetti, a <I>Blast</I> evening and
 addresses given "to the sound of carefully chosen trumpets"; short plays,
 <I>ombres chinoises,</I> and lectures by Arnold Schoenberg and Alexander
 Scriabin were promised. Finally, it was an avant-garde environment:
 "the only room in Europe where artists belonging to the New movement
 in art have had so free a hand, and done work on this scale." But it
 was scarcely a social center; it had no dining facilities, no cabaret
 turns, and no tango teas. The stockbrokers and tradesmen were left
 behind, but at some cost: almost nobody came. The avant-garde cabaret
 experiment was over and its principal components disassembled into
 the Rebel Art Centre (which quickly faded), the dance-and-supper clubs
 (which sprang up everywhere), and the music hall (which enjoyed a final
 flourish with the coming of revue).

Fly!</I>  was a music-hall revue. Between 1908 and 1912 the
metropolitan halls were developing into

<B></B>

"palaces of variety," and revue helped broaden their audience and extend
their appeal, while "killing with refinement" the music hall as Victorian
audiences had known it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 The impact of revue, together with that of the Russian Ballet and
 American song and dance forms, eclipsed the long tradition of music-hall
 ballet. The last in-house work at the Alhambra was staged in 1912 and at
 the Empire in 1915, but already in 1912, as one critic commented, above
 and beyond revue hung the shadow of cinema, where "by the expenditure of
 the humble sixpence . . . one can for a couple of hours run through the
 gamut of all the histrionic emotions--tragedy, comedy, farce, scenic
 effect, melodrama, and illustrations of Nature's marvels hitherto
 undreamt of."

"Revue" was a term adopted from the French for a dramatic "review of
the year," satirizing topical events and personalities in loosely linked
scenes of dialogue and song. It became both increasingly spectacular, with
lavish costumes, sets, and chorus numbers, and increasingly parodic,
offering not only burlesques of current events, popular fashions,
and well-known individuals but also parodies of both "high" art forms
and rival performers. Extravagant spectacles with long-legged chorus
lines made an easy appeal to popular taste (and to the new bourgeois
audience for variety and revue), even while the audience for Shirley
Kellogg in <I>Hullo Ragtime!</I> at the London Hippodrome in 1912 had
to get the point of Ethel Levey's impersonation of Anna Pavlova in "The
Baccanale Rag." Kellogg and Levey appeared in the 1913 follow-up revue,
<I>Hullo Tango!,</I> with costumes by L&eacute;on Bakst, the designer
for the Russian Ballet. Levey appeared in one scene as Countess Zicka in
"Hiplomacy," a parody of Victorien Sardou's <I>Diplomacy;</I> in another
scene, in a startlingly self-referential bit of business, Harry Tate
gave an impersonation of how George Robey would play Tate's own sketch
"Golfing." <I>Hullo . . . London!</I> by George Grossmith at the Empire
Theatre in 1910 included a skit on Lady Constance Stewart-Richardson,
the aristocratic "Grecian" dancer in the style of Isadora Duncan. <I>All
Change Here</I> at the Alhambra in 1911 offered a burlesque of Richard
Strauss's <I>Elektra</I> at Covent Garden.
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>
 This is all to say that the contemporary audience was sufficiently
 familiar with current developments in the music hall, the Russian Ballet,
 opera, the legitimate theatre, and popular music, to get the references.
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 But at the same time the increasingly lavish productions of "spectacular"
 revue, derived from America, were smothering the sharpness, pace, and
 irony of "intimate" revue, closer to cabaret and derived from Paris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>

<P>
<I>Kill That Fly!,</I> "a new and original review by George Grossmith,"
opened at the Alhambra on 14 October 1912.
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 The scene set in the Metropolitan Cabaret was a skit on the Cave of the
 Golden Calf: a popular cultural spoof of the avant-garde; and almost,
 if not quite, a "spectacular" spoof of an "intimate" revue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 The phrase "kill that fly" was "a Yankeeism which implies having a
 flip at anything that may be making a buzz"; the revue touched "gaily
 and without offence upon nearly every subject of the period--Politics,
 the Stage, Eugenics, Fashions in Costume and in Dancing, Society, the
 Exhibitions, and so on and so on"
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 (though to the relief of another critic, not on those now-tedious
 topics, the "Suffragists, the Insurance Act . . . the revolt of

<B></B>

the doctors, the Balkan War, and Home Rule").
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 <I>Kill That Fly!</I> was one of the first revues to benefit from the
 Lord Chamberlain's relaxation of rules governing music-hall performance,
 and to stage satirical characterizations of the politicians Asquith,
 Lloyd George, and Reginald McKenna as well as skits on George Edwardes
 (the manager of the Empire), Gaby Deslys, and the composer Oscar Straus.

<P>
Discussing the Parisian context, Weiss has pointed out that revue
depends on topicality, allusion, and parody, in the form of a
"jumbling and splicing of current events" into a rapid succession of
loosely linked scenes (<I>PC,</I> 30). Its heterogeneity and lack of
a framing narrative link it to newspapers and collage. Both collage
and revue aestheticize the elisions of newspaper syntax, so that to
"practice the revue in any form [is] . . . to cultivate an aesthetic of
the newspaper," the essential context and subtext of the revue genre
(<I>PC,</I> 18). In Weiss's definition, revue is to be understood as
"a comic system according to which . . . society commentated itself"
(<I>PC,</I> 36). In Britain as in Paris, a loosely understood "cubism,"
or as of 1912 "futurism," or some such phrase as "modern art" was a topic
for newspapers and music hall alike: one more sign of the times, one
more source of parody. But at the same time music-hall revue, with its
puns and allusions and spliced topicalities, its fondness for ragtime and
spectacle and punctured pretensions, offered a quotidian touchstone for
a certain kind of modernist aesthetic. This was the "enormous, jangling,
journalistic, fairy desert of modern life" that served the artist "as
Nature did more technically primitive man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 Or as Lewis put it elsewhere, "Folk Art, along with Music Hall Songs,
 and authors of Pagliaccis, Viennese Waltzes, etc., is very seducing
 and certainly the next best thing to Bach. (The officially 'serious'
 artists of any time, who practise 'le grand Art,' come well below
 'My Home in Dixie.')"
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>

<P>
The vernacular and the popular are sources of invigoration for
an avant-garde that wants to mark its distance from the diluted
naturalisms, symbolisms, and impressionisms of fin-de-si&egrave;cle
bourgeois culture, and stake its claim to modernity through a newly
expressive formal vocabulary allied to a keen sensibility toward
the textures and experience of everyday life. Nevertheless, the move
toward the vernacular or the popular is, in Lewis's terms, a careful
discrimination made with a new elite culture in mind. "We don't want
to-day things made entirely of gold (but gold mixed with flint or grass,
diamond with paste, etc.). . . . But the condition of our enjoyment of
vulgarity, discord, cheapness or noise is an unimpaired and keen disgust
with it. . . . Rare and cheap, fine and poor, these contrasts are the
male and female, the principle of creation to-day."
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>

<P>
The topicality of the avant-garde brought Mme. Strindberg added publicity
and a return on her investment in avant-garde artists. Once the Cabaret
Theatre Club had entered the public domain, or once the press had turned
it into a (distinctively visual) reference point for a larger audience
than had ever frequented the club, it was ripe for parody in music-hall
revue. The <I>Sunday Referee</I> complained that <I>Kill That Fly!</I>
was at times "a little too intimate, perhaps, for anybody but the man
about town," but the press was happy to spell out references, and the
<I>Sketch</I> reproduced a photograph of the Metropolitan Cabaret scene,
clearly labelling it "A Skit on the

<B></B>

Cave of the Calf."
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 The circularity of the connections between publicity, performance,
 the avant-garde, and urban themes in modernist painting, can
 be neatly tracked through a clipping from the Paris newspaper
 <I>Actualit&eacute;,</I> with its photograph of a "Cabaret de Cubistes
 &agrave; Londres": in the background is Lewis's drop-curtain for the
 Cave of the Calf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>
 <I>Actualit&eacute;</I> also ran a painting of Piccadilly Circus,
 rendered in a hard-edged, sardonic, cartoon-like style, loosely
 compatible with the cabaret manner of Ginner and Gore. Charles Ginner's
 <I>Piccadilly Circus</I> , now in the Tate Gallery, is clearly
 distinct; this piece is probably one of the two posters Mme. Strindberg
 commissioned from the artist along with wall decorations for the
 Cave. Most of the image's middle ground is taken up with the Clapham
 omnibus, and most of the omnibus is occupied by a large advertisement
 for the "new Alhambra revue." Any time after 14 October, this would have
 been <I>Kill That Fly!,</I> with its skit on the Cabaret Theatre Club.

It might even be the case, allowing for theatrical license and the
constraints of a proscenium stage, that photographs of <I>Kill That
Fly!</I> contain further clues as to what the Cave looked like (<A
HREF="4.2tickner_5.html"> 5</A>); the "A. E. Craven" who designed
the sets was well acquainted with the Cave of the Golden Calf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>
 Obviously the high frontal sets could not reproduce the smoky, intimate
 ambience of the basement Cave. There is no sign of Epstein's "barbaric"
 plaster carvings that clothed the supporting iron columns, although
 in the scene of "Miss Muriel Hudson singing her rag-time medley" there
 are two squat, shaven-headed, Eastern-looking idols seated

<B></B>

on either side of the back doorway.
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 Other features, however, are readily identifiable. Gill's calf appears
 three times: at the back of the stage on the right; in relief above
 the curtained central door (with the word "Troglodytes" attached to
 it); and again above the door on the left. Ginner's triptych in the
 Cave is directly reproduced in the wall painting at the back, but
 inserted into it are two jagged, irregular forms and the re of a
 performer strongly reminiscent of Gore's <I>A Singer at the Bedford
 Music Hall</I> of 1912. The frieze above loosely follows the jungle
 theme and cartoon-like style of Ginner's <I>Oil Study for Tiger-Hunting
 Mural in the Cave of the Golden Calf.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>
 Above the "Cabaret Cosmopolitan" poster at the back left is a hieroglyph
 based on Lewis's three-headed calf design for the "Cabaret Theatre
 Club" brochure. (The two res on either side have been separated
 out so that the overall shape is no longer as compact; the features
 on the left have been orientalized, and those on the right made more
 conventionally feminine.)

<P>
Above the right-hand door are three res at a table, with Lewis's
characteristic, jagged-edged diagonals, and what appear to be ominous,
Gauguinesque birds in the foreground. On the left-hand side of the
photograph, Lewis's seated female (at the top) and dancing res
(below) are taken from the "Programme" and the "Cabaret Theatre Club"
brochure. (Craven probably took them directly from the publicity; Lewis
is unlikely to have scaled them up as wall decorations himself or they
would have been mentioned in the club's publicity for its second season,
opening at precisely this moment, on 15 October.) Between them hangs
a painting with something like the motif of ships on a wedge of sea
from Gore's studies for his deer-hunting mural, and on the left side
of the set, above the door and calf, quite clearly if inexplicably,
is Frederick Etchells's <I>The Dead Mole,</I> exhibited at the second
Post-Impressionist Exhibition in 1912 and reproduced in its catalog
(this angle does not appear in  5).

<P>
The Metropolitan Cabaret scene appears to reproduce accurately the loosely
knit program of the Cabaret Theatre Club, with its odd division between
the pagan, "primitive" jungle themes of Epstein, Gill, Ginner, and Gore;
as well as what Violet Hunt recalled as Lewis's "raw meat designs":
"Bismarckian images, severings, disembowellings, mixed pell-mell with
the iron shards that did it, splashed with the pale blood of exhausted
heroes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF108" HREF="#FOOT108">108</a></SUP>
 There was more than a touch of irony here, so Craven's sets were, perhaps
 unwittingly, doubly parodic. One <I>Observer</I> critic (P. G. Konody
 perhaps, who was <I>parti pris</I>) complimented

this group of artistic revolutionaries upon the happy title which
has been bestowed upon and accepted by them. The "Troglodytes," or
"Cave-dwellers," is a singularly appropriate appellation for a coterie
of artists, who are not only connected with the "Cave of the Calf," but
who aim--most of them--at the primitive simplicity of the days when art
was in its infancy. . . . on bones and on the walls of caves. . . .

The irony may have been lost on the casual visitor. The Rocking Horse Club
in Marriott's <I>Subsoil</I> was "named after an innocent illustration
in art-criticism which had raised a storm of mingled derision and
enthusiastic assent about the writer's

<B></B>

 ears" (<I>S,</I> 9). The reference is clearly to the catalog of the
 first Post-Impressionist exhibition in which Desmond MacCarthy, writing
 from Fry's notes, claimed that "a good rocking-horse is more like a
 horse than the snapshot of a Derby winner"; the same essay suggested
 that Post-Impressionism was symptomatic of a "return to primitive, even
 perhaps of a return to barbaric art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF110" HREF="#FOOT110">110</a></SUP>
 Cork may not be wrong to suggest that on one level the jungle scenes
 offered "a fitting location for the primal emotions they wanted to
 unleash" (<I>ABG,</I> 68), but it seems possible that he misses the
 sarcasm: a gleeful fastening on the notion of the primitive as a now
 ubiquitous critical term, lapped up by a shallow and gullible audience
 prepared to rehearse their modernist litany without too much care for
 the paintings it served.

<B>London, 1910-14: The Dance Craze (From the Tango to the

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The dance was a favorite theme of artists and poets from the 1880s to
World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF112" HREF="#FOOT112">112</a></SUP>
 But Edvard Munch's dance of life or W. B. Yeats's symbolist identity of
 dancer and dance, the art nouveau line of La Goulue or Loie Fuller, the
 rapturous roses of fin-de-si&egrave;cle decadence at the Empire ballet,
 even Matisse's <I>La Danse,</I> have little in common with Lewis's
 fascination with the "primitive" and the machine. Lewis depicts res
 in a dance that is vigorous, acrobatic, and highly expressive. Arms
 are raised above the head; knees and elbows are akimbo; torsos are
 twisted; and features are fixed, mask-like, and grim. We can at least
 be confident of what it is <I>not</I>--languid, decorous, fluid or
 balletic--and confident too that this is more than just an unforeseen
 consequence of Lewis's chosen style. Bearing in mind the social and
 pictorial relations between sexuality, modernity, and the dance, we
 may ask: What were the dances popular at the time and danced at the
 Cabaret Theatre Club; and what was the point (and the <I>work</I>) of
 the dance as a referent in Lewis's pictorial strategies?

<P>
Between about 1910 and 1914 there was an explosion of interest in all
forms of dance--vernacular, theatrical, and social.
<SUP><a NAME="REF113" HREF="#FOOT113">113</a></SUP>
 Folk dances were energetically collected, photographed and
 revived. Theatrical and ballet conventions were overturned by dancers
 like Isadora Duncan and the Russian Ballet. On the dance floor, the
 previously daring "Do you reverse?" paled beside risqu&eacute; new dances
 like the tango, the two-step, and the Brazilian maxixe. These forms
 leaked into each other: the tango reached London from Paris via <I>The
 Sunshine Girl</I> at the Gaiety Theatre in 1912; professionals gave
 theatrical displays of the flamenco or tarantella; the professional tango
 dancers Irene and Vernon Castle gave demonstrations at social dances
 or shared the bill with the Russian Ballet at Deauville Casino; and the
 Parisian apache dance, posing as an urban vernacular, became a popular
 spectacle in music halls and cabarets. Dance societies and classes were
 formed; journals, sheet music, and books were published; tango teas
 were instituted everywhere; and ragtime became a craze. Augustus John
 wrote to John Quinn, "I haven't got the Tango-craze yet but I have a
 dance now and then; rag-time can't be resisted."
<SUP><a NAME="REF114" HREF="#FOOT114">114</a></SUP>

<P>
Although <I>Kermesse</I> itself is lost, there are several gouache studies
associated with it, and similar themes in Lewis's other designs for the
club including stationery,

<B></B>

menus, a poster, and a program cover. This corpus of works includes
the Yale <I>Kermesse</I> (M72), <I>The Dancers </I>(Study for
<I>Kermesse?</I>) (M48), the <I>Design for a Programme Cover--Kermesse</I>
(M52), <I>Dancer</I> (M47), <I>Lovers</I> (M74), <I>A Wall Decoration
in the Cave of the Golden Calf</I> (M33), and probably the comparable
<I>Abstract Design</I> (M29).
<SUP><a NAME="REF115" HREF="#FOOT115">115</a></SUP>
 They constitute a recognizable subgroup among Lewis's works of 1912,
 having in common a cubo-futurist mode of drawing, a set of thematic
 references to dance and festivity, and a direct or inferential link to
 the Cave of the Golden Calf.

<P><A NAME="6" HREF="4.2tickner_6.html">

Lewis's works of 1912 refer to a variety of contemporary dance
forms. <I>Lovers,</I> as we have seen, derives from Dearly's and
Mistinguett's apaches. The <I>Wall Decoration in the Cave of the Golden
Calf</I> may owe something to the influence of Diaghilev's dancers <I>en
point</I> (the Russian Ballet had its first London season in 1911).
<SUP><a NAME="REF116" HREF="#FOOT116">116</a></SUP>
 <I>The Dancers</I> seem to hold drapery or veils (see the cover
 illustration of this issue): Salomes were ubiquitous in this period
<SUP><a NAME="REF117" HREF="#FOOT117">117</a></SUP>
 and the Cave advertised "veil dances" in 1912, but the connection
 may be to <I>The Nautch Girl,</I> with Indian costumes designed by
 Albert Rothenstein, performed in June 1912. (The conventional delicacy
 of Rothenstein's watercolor costume-study, reproduced in the Cave's
 publicity, has perhaps blinded us to the link between this work and
 <I>The Dancers.</I>) The Yale <I>Kermesse</I> is different again
 (<A HREF="4.2tickner_6.html"> 6</A>). A <I>Sunday Times</I>
 reviewer praised as the best item on the

<B></B>

program a Spanish dancer "fraught with the spirit of Spain and the
passion of the Latin blood. Not for a long time has a male dancer, whose
art is not academic but intuitive, roused so much enthusiasm among an
audience, many of whom were <I>connoisseurs</I> and <I>gourmets</I> of
choreographic art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF118" HREF="#FOOT118">118</a></SUP>
 Lewis was in Spain in 1902, 1908, and 1910; the raised arms, ferocious
 expressions, and ecstatic rhythm of the Yale <I>Kermesse</I> do invoke
 something like flamenco and the patterned, almost mechanical beat
 of stamping feet and castanets. The Breton costumes, however, put
 it in Brittany, and the "Preliminary Prospectus" promised "a scene
 from a Breton 'Wake'" along with coster dances and dances from Goya's
 "Caprichos" on the opening night.
<SUP><a NAME="REF119" HREF="#FOOT119">119</a></SUP>

<P>
In the Yale <I>Kermesse</I> the sense of sexual abandon is menacing. Even
in the study we can not watch the performance with impunity; the spectator
in Brodzky's drypoint would have been engulfed by it. The central couple
advances threateningly, a demented arthropod with limbs akimbo, its face
a mask of fury, a voracious puppet with the appetite of a praying mantis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF120" HREF="#FOOT120">120</a></SUP>
 The man on the left raises a glass; two more lie overturned on the
 countertop, and in a flurry of angular pen-strokes we can make out
 his legs and shoes drumming at the ground below. A skirted re
 leaps screaming into the frame on the right with the drink held in an
 outstretched arm streaming in a solid arc down to her head. If this
 is a dance it is somehow a dance of danger and death, an impression
 enhanced by the blue-white shards (all pleated metal and sharpened
 blades and broken glass); by the tyro-like dentistry and up-flung arm
 of the re on the right; by the characteristically crosshatched,
 lobster-claw ellipses; by the white wings of light, offsetting with
 their upward sweep the orchestration of curves and blades below; and by
 the force with which Lewis has scratched and gouged the lines across
 his washes and into the surface of the paper. It is very difficult to
 read this image more benignly, and one critic who admired its vigorous
 geometry nevertheless claimed that it was less like a peasant carnival
 than the tournament scene from <I>Ivanhoe</I> or "some terrible battle
 of extermination between murderous insects."
<SUP><a NAME="REF121" HREF="#FOOT121">121</a></SUP>
 <I>Design for a Programme Cover--Kermesse</I> appears to re a sexual
 assault. <I>The Dancers,</I> with some lessening of hostilities, confirms
 the theme of penetration, partly through the re-ground relation
 in all these pictures. Pound once praised Vorticism for giving him new
 eyes, for showing him the shapes between things and the wedges of sky
 between the roofs of houses; here the wedges attack the roofs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF122" HREF="#FOOT122">122</a></SUP>
 There is no background, only intersecting planes where, in contrast with
 cubism proper, the manner of intersection is violently rendered. The
 nonral shapes, where we can distinguish them, thrust into, dissect,
 and abrade the combatants in a manner that echos the etched scars of
 Lewis's pen.

<P>
The point is not that the Lewisian dance was simply a stylized
illustration of any particular contemporary dance, or that there is
a simple correspondence between salon painting and the sylvan ballet
or ballroom waltz, on the one hand, and between Lewis's brand of
cubo-futurism and the tango, flamenco, or apache dance on the other. I
mean instead that there were certain intense sympathies between the
Latin histories, myths, rhythms, and overtly erotic movements of
such dances--Quinn in a letter to Augustus John called tango dancing
"homeopathic fornication"
<SUP><a NAME="REF123" HREF="#FOOT123">123</a></SUP>
--and Lewis's

<B></B>

apparent desire to move in and out of the hinterland of abstraction,
retaining the re as a sexualized body, but splintering his forms,
integrating re and ground, reducing (though by no means eliminating)
the signifiers of sexual difference. He <I>stages</I> an encounter
between violence and sexuality, all the while refusing absolutely the
coy fleshiness of the salon nude in favour of something more imperious
but mechanical.

<P>
Here Lewis had his peers in mind as well. His combative personality was
such that he needed "a network of enmity and opposition . . . to have
a sense of himself as a creative and coherent personality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF124" HREF="#FOOT124">124</a></SUP>
 Part of that network can be found in the work and influence of Duncan,
 Diaghilev, and &Eacute;mile Jaques-Dalcroze. The "connoisseurs and
 gourmets of choreographic art" at the Cabaret Theatre Club--indeed any
 attentive newspaper reader--would have been familiar with them all.

Isadora Duncan "radically altered ideas about the potential of the
human body as an expressive instrument"; she danced alone, barefoot,
in a self-consciously "Greek" manner, with spare settings and classical
draperies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF126" HREF="#FOOT126">126</a></SUP>
 Margaret Morris, who appeared at the Cabaret Theatre Club with her
 "Greek Children Dancers," took lessons from Duncan's brother Raymond,
 who was in London "lecturing on the way of life of the ancient Greeks
 and on their dance and music."
<SUP><a NAME="REF127" HREF="#FOOT127">127</a></SUP>
 From him Morris learned "the six Greek positions and variations, copied
 from early Greek vases" and made them the basis of her technique.

 In 1913 she took her troupe to Paris, together with a letter of

<P>
Fergusson was the art editor of <I>Rhythm</I> magazine and a great
admirer of Diaghilev's Russian Ballet, whose lush exoticism exploited a
range of Balkan and Near Eastern sources in pursuit of effects that were
voluptuously decorative and at times scandalously erotic. <I>Rhythm</I>
was influenced by Henri Bergson and fauvism, and its writers and

Lewis favoured something sparer, harder, and more directly red
as sexual combat. His sexual aesthetic was phallic, homophobic, and
(ambivalently) misogynist. His Cabaret res are amazons who part
their thighs and tilt their pelvises with studied provocation. Duncan
and Morris were too self-absorbed for Lewis; their "neo-Greekness"--the
bare feet and fluttering draperies--was to invoke an expressive and
spontaneous femininity, and was therefore alien to the Vorticist men.
<SUP><a NAME="REF131" HREF="#FOOT131">131</a></SUP>
 Classicism literally wasn't their line. Henri Gaudier-Brzeska
 specifically associated the soft contours of the Hellenic tradition
 with a debased aesthetic, placing himself in what he saw as the tougher,
 more instinctual, and phallic lineage of the tribal and "barbaric." He
 also made the particular connection between Greek sculpture and

<B></B>

"Greek love."
<SUP><a NAME="REF132" HREF="#FOOT132">132</a></SUP>
 Among cognoscenti at the time, the homosexuality or sexual ambiguity
 of Diaghilev and his leading artists was well known. And with the
 Russian Ballet (particularly through the impact of L&eacute;on Bakst
 on the designer Poiret) the world of ballet erupted into the world of
 fashion. Both the covert homosexuality and the explicit (and "feminine")
 fashionability of the Ballet, together with <I>Rhythm</I>'s enthusiasm
 for it and the terms in which that was expressed, grated on Lewis's
 sensibilities. His sympathies lay elsewhere: broadly, on the side of
 the masculine, the mechanical, the abstract, and the engineered, as
 opposed to the Bakst-Poiret-Matisse axis described by Peter Wollen as the
 alternative trajectory never developed, but never entirely repressed,
 in modernism's myth of its own origins: a liminal art of eroticism,
 exoticism, decoration, and the body.

One can not imagine Lewis as a student of eurhythmics, the system of
rhythmical bodily movements advocated by Dalcroze that emphasized the link
between dance and health. Dalcroze's Institut opened in a Dresden suburb
in 1911, and in 1912 <I>The Eurhythmics of Emile Jaques Dalcroze</I>
was published in English, replete with illustrations of various "plastic
exercises" and an essay by Michael Sadler on "The Value of Eurhythmics
to Art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF134" HREF="#FOOT134">134</a></SUP>
 All this would have been known to John Fergusson when he painted <I>Les
 Eus</I> ("The well people," or "The healthy ones") in 1911-12
 (<A HREF="4.2tickner_7.html"> 7</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF135" HREF="#FOOT135">135</a></SUP>
 The peculiar title, though invented by

<B></B>

Fergusson, derives from Dalcroze. The rather heavy-handed <I>la
ronde</I> amid luxuriant vegetation, a transparently modern fantasy
of an ancient fertility rite, is indebted to Duncan, Dalcroze, and
possibly Diaghilev. It sums up pictorially <I>Rhythm</I>'s obsession
with dance as an art form, and with rhythm as the condition to which
all art aspires. Lewis probably didn't know it before 1914, when it
was shown at the Dor&eacute; Galleries, and perhaps not even then. It
would be hard to prove that Lewis intended <I>Kermesse,</I> among other
things, as a rebuff to <I>Les Eus</I> specifically, but not that it was
directed against <I>Rhythm</I>'s Bergsonian vitalism in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF136" HREF="#FOOT136">136</a></SUP>
 For <I>Rhythm,</I> as for Dalcroze, energy expressed in patterned
 movement was a symbol of life, health, and sanity (an implicit reproach
 to Max Nordau and the view of modernism as a symptom of cultural
 degeneracy). Such female nudes as Fergusson's <I>Rhythm,</I> <I>La
 Force,</I> and <I>Torse de Femme</I> portray buxom women as the source
 of natural fecundity; they are the allegorical embodiment of Bergson's
 <I>&eacute;lan vital.</I> Lewis's res are demonic rather than
 eurhythmic, and they are far from promising what Michael Sadler looked
 for in Hellerau: "a new and more harmonious race, almost a realization
 of Rousseau's ideal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF137" HREF="#FOOT137">137</a></SUP>

<P>
<I>Kermesse</I> is an urgent reworking of the fauve dance as it had been
inherited from the symbolists as an emblem both of the dance of life and
of the "thinking body." For Lewis, life is combat, the body doesn't think,
and dance isn't the easy expression of Bergsonian vitality. Dalcroze
and Fergusson are too blandly Bergsonian; Diaghilev too fashionable,
voluptuous, and sexually ambiguous; Duncan and Morris too solipsistic,
their Hellenism thematically antimodern and carrying the distant echo
of classical homosexuality. The Latin or "negro" rhythms of the tango,
the tarantella, the flamenco, and ragtime are by contrast flamboyantly
demotic and hot-bloodedly heterosexual. When <I>Blast</I> speaks of
the Vortex that "will not hear of anything but its disastrous polished
dance," it is neither Duncan, Diaghilev, nor Dalcroze who comes to mind.

<B>The Albert Hall, 1913: The Picture Ball</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
At the end of November 1913, Edward Marsh wrote to a friend, "Another
new light whom I met today is Wyndham Lewis. (I am going to the Picture
Ball, if you please, as a futurist picture designed by him!) He is very
magnificent to look at, but I don't think he liked me, and I suspected
him of pose, so we shan't make friends."
<SUP><a NAME="REF139" HREF="#FOOT139">139</a></SUP>
 Shortly after the ball took place Marsh received a letter from
 D. H. Lawrence, avid for news of both it and the Lewis costume: "How
 did you look, futuristically? Lord, you're a bit of a jig-saw puzzle
 to start with, mixing poets and pictures, the Admiralty, and what-not,
 like somebody shuffling cards."
<SUP><a NAME="REF140" HREF="#FOOT140">140</a></SUP>
 Trivial in itself, the Albert Hall Picture Ball is nevertheless an
 exemplary instance of high society's assimilation of the popular culture
 of modern art and of Lewis's part in it. This moment of absorption
 depended on an extension of Futurist elements from the gallery into
 fashion, d&eacute;cor, and entertainment--not quite the same thing as a
 Futurist dissolution of art into life but briefly consonant with it. It
 depended too on the emergence of a fancy-dress craze spanning artists'
 revels and fashionable balls, in which competitive participants

<B></B>

distinguished themselves from the common ruck of historical, Old Master,
or commedia dell'arte res by their enthusiasm for dressing out
of Post-Impressionist paintings, &agrave; la Diaghilev, as Futurists,
or apaches.

The <I>Sketch</I> supplement for 10 December 1913 devoted six pages of
photographs to the Albert Hall Picture Ball, including the two tableaux
designed by Lewis and Nevinson to represent "The Very Latest School of
Painting: Futurist res" (<A HREF="4.2tickner_8.html"> 8</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF142" HREF="#FOOT142">142</a></SUP>
 The caption explains that one represents "The Birth of Futurism" and one
 "The Culmination of Futurism," and certainly the three res on the
 upper right, with

<B></B>

their more angular stances and boxy costumes, bear witness to the
impact of cubism on the milder Futurism to the left. Somewhere here, but
unidentifiable, lurks Eddie Marsh. Lewis is present at least symbolically
in the masked re whose dark and mustachioed features bear a striking
resemblance to his own. The page as a whole evokes the context, with its
illustrations of friends and family parties arrayed as Italian Primitives,
or the Dutch School, or res from an Egyptian frieze, and in this
company the Futurist costumes seem to pack a certain subversive punch. But
the extended captions are dense with Lords, Ladies, and Honourables and
with (mostly feminine) names familiar from the overlapping circles of art,
society, and politics (Lavery, Tennant, Asquith). "Futurism" was quite at
home in this company, or at least its domesticated variants were, exuding
as they did the pleasantly pungent whiff of lingering controversy. The
Futurist groups were not a disruptive or even mischievous contribution
from beyond the pale of the historical canon or the charmed circle of the
chief participants, but a witty update commissioned by Lady Muriel Paget,
honorary secretary of the charity ball, a well-known social re, a
regular supporter of the avant-garde, and, as the <I>Tatler</I> noted,
a very capable tangoist.

as I had more on my hands than I knew how to cope with, I was at the

for the Albert Hall Picture Ball of the Futurists, while Lady Cunard

was giving a dance to General Sir John French. I went fifty-fifty

Two drafts of undated letters to Lady Muriel Paget survive in Lewis's
correspondence at Cornell. In what is presumably the first he writes,
"It occurred to me after I had left you that I should have advised you
not to show the two sketches to people destined to impersonate res in
them, unless they were peculiarly imaginative and d&eacute;brouillards."

This note reminds us of two things. In October of 1913 Lewis had fallen
out with Roger Fry and the Omega Workshops but not yet with Nevinson and
Marinetti. (Nevinson was an ally in his opposition to Bloomsbury and in
the opening months of

<B></B>

1914 a colleague in the planning of <I>Blast</I> and the opening of the
Rebel Art Centre; the break with Nevinson and Marinetti would come over
the publication of their joint <I>Manifesto of Vital English Art</I> in
June). Lewis probably needed to earn some money, but if his costumes are
in any sense a parody of Futurism, it is affectionate and, as it were,
from the inside. Secondly, as in the relations between the avant-garde and
popular entertainment, there is something newly spectacular, journalistic,
even flirtatious, in the alliance between modernists like Lewis and
Nevinson and fashionable aristocrats like Countess Drogheda, Lady
Muriel Paget, and Lady Cunard. There was nothing new about pageants and
fancy-dress parties. What is new is the sense that they have an audience
beyond their participants, that they provide copy and photographs for
the press and can be restaged for new purposes. These are no longer the
more-or-less documentary images of the wealthy and influential en route
to Parliament or Ascot or St. Moritz or the local hunt. Here we have high
society <I>arranging itself</I> in ordered tableaux for consumption by
the readership of the illustrated press.

<P>
The same thing goes on in all of the many images of beautiful women
posed with their children, at their dressing tables, in their newly
designed drawing rooms, among the accoutrements we would now describe as
signifying a lifestyle through patterns of leisure and consumption. It
seems extraordinary, given the power of (bourgeois) concepts of
"womanliness," that this phenomenon was so little commented on. The
contemporaneous spectacle of women taking to the streets in pursuit of
the vote caused apoplexy in the same people whose wives and daughters
were happy to make a spectacle of themselves in the popular press. One
of the few critics to voice an opinion was David Cooper, in the deeply
conservative pages of <I>Modern Man.</I> According to Cooper,

one of the most disquieting and unpleasant symptoms of modern
English society is the disgusting and shameless way in which people

offenders. Pick up any of the illustrated weeklies and you will find
photographs of titled women, in attire a good deal scantier than
that of Miss Maud Allan as Salome. . . . they expose their charms to
the gaze of the vulgar. They do more; they have not only themselves,
their children, their various possessions, but even their bedrooms
photographed. . . . These women are obsessed with an insensate and
depraved craving for publicity. Snobs themselves, they pander to the most
despicable snobbery. . . . What sort of men are the husbands, fathers,

There is something virulent and almost hysterical about this
conflation of class hatred with misogyny, this lumping together of
spectacle, femininity, consumption, and snobbery as a kind of symbolic
prostitution. But it hits a nerve. Both the production and consumption
of art are, under modern conditions, closely linked to subjectivity. One
of the pleasures and consolations of patronage, for the Medici, say,
in the fifteenth century or for the purchasers of Wedgwood ware in the
eighteenth, derived from its social prestige. The controversies attached
to avant-garde movements

<B></B>

 before World War I, the lack of a public arena (in the traditional
 sense), together with the rise of press interest and a concomitant flurry
 of manifestos raised the stakes in the game of consuming identities. This
 is not to suggest that modernist gambits or the patronage they attracted
 were in some simple sense spurious; rather, that they had (and have)
 different tasks to perform. Bound up with more obviously "painterly"
 issues is an ambiguous and unstable dynamic, involving a relation
 between the artist's differentiation of himself <I>as</I> avant-garde
 and the consumer's identity-
<BR>
in-difference purchased through association and the expression of an
"advanced" taste.

<P>
The process is peculiarly transparent with Lewis, who protests loudly
and in print his successive detachment from the orbits of John, Sickert,
Bloomsbury, and Futurism; and perhaps also with Lady Cunard, Lady Drogheda
("Countess and Futurist: A Patron of the New Decor"),
<SUP><a NAME="REF148" HREF="#FOOT148">148</a></SUP>
 and Lady Muriel Paget ("One of Our Younger Social Beauties" who "knows

 Of course <I>Blast</I> was controversial when it appeared in 1914,
 but several reviewers found it tame, a diluted Futurism. One reviewer
 claimed to have "left it on the sofa in my wife's drawing-room on the
 occasion of her monthly 'At Home,' and she tells me that the t for
 it among her visitant women-folk was vicious."

 "Kill John Bull With Art" had been Lewis's slogan, but as Lewis

"The Spirit of Futurism" was the title for Lewis Baumer's design for a

 Some version of that spirit erupted in clothing, d&eacute;cor,
 typography, theatrical sets, music-hall turns, party favors, dance
 performances, and other aspects of British culture between 1912
 and 1914. As a term, "futurism" was borrowed from Marinetti and his
 associates, stripped of some of its specific aesthetic and political
 content, and used to name a sense of disruption and change in all
 areas of social and cultural life. As Lawrence Rainey puts it, "By a
 kind of metonymy facilitated by the modern newspaper's juxtaposition of
 disparate events, Futurism [became] the cipher of a contemporary crisis"
 ("FT," 198-99). An article in the <I>Tatler</I> accompanying the
 first main impact of Futurism in 1912 and headed "Unrest in the Art
 World" is characteristic.

I wonder whether western Europe is going rapidly mad. Most decidedly it is
getting terribly hysterical. Labour is in blind revolt against Capital,
and Capital is seeking new spectacles with which to regard Labour. Youth
has begun to kick out at Age and modern Womanhood has certainly gone
off her head. Strauss has hurled the fury of his atmospheric discords
into the middle of Music; Debussy has put the extinguisher on Melody,
and it is significant of the signs of the times that last week, when
the Royal Academy had to close its doors for fear that some rampant
petticoat would show her aptitude for voting by smashing pictures, the
Italian Futurists opened an exhibition of their works at the Sackville

Futurism itself depended on a high public profile, derived partly from
Marinetti's splenetic performances and partly from this association with
revolution (for its supporters) or hysteria (for its detractors). It
drew simultaneously on the resources of popular culture and on this
<I>aube-de-si&egrave;cle</I> sense of change. There was two-way traffic
between Futurism and the music hall. When Edward Marsh heard Marinetti
lecture at the Poetry Bookshop, probably on 18 November 1913, he wrote
to Rupert Brooke that Marinetti was "beyond doubt an extraordinary man,
full of force and fire, with a surprising gift of turgid lucidity,
a full and roaring and foaming flood of indubitable half-truths
. . . [as] a piece of art, I thought it was about on the level of a
very good farmyard-imitation--a supreme music-hall turn" (<I>EM,</I>
295). Marinetti thought highly of the music hall and would have taken this
as a compliment. He performed in small avant-garde contexts such as the
Cabaret Theatre Club, the Poetry Bookshop, and the Dor&eacute; Gallery,
but also staked a claim for the larger spaces and public audiences of
the Bechstein Hall and the Coliseum and, in his 1913 manifesto "The
Variety Theater," for music hall as a paradigmatically Futurist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF155" HREF="#FOOT155">155</a></SUP>

<P>
Weiss suggests that "The Variety Theater" manifesto has been grossly
neglected and that it contains "virtually a complete repertoire of the
pictorial devices of futurism, most notably the principles of dynamism
and audience participation" (<I>PC,</I> 39). "The music hall," according
to Marinetti, is "naturally anti-academic, primitive, and ingenuous, and
therefore the more significant for the unexpectedness of its experiments
and the simplicity of its means. . . . It destroys the solemn, the
sacred, the serious and the sublime of Art with a capital <I>A</I>"
(<I>SW,</I> 119). Its radical techniques of collage, montage, slapstick,
and parody provided in effect a modern urban aesthetic parallel to the
avant-garde address to city life. The music hall could only be enhanced
by such further Futurist devices as soaping the stage, painting the
actors, and selling several tickets to the same seat. Weiss goes so
far as to suggest that "the subtext of Marinetti's claims appears to
be that futurism itself is virtually an avant-garde counterpart to
recent developments in popular entertainment" (<I>PC,</I> 40), with
both Marinetti and the entertainment daily <I>Comoedia</I> "promoting
music-hall comedy as a force of modernity" (<I>PC,</I> 41).

<P>
Marinetti's own appearance on the music-hall stage in 1914 was not a
success with the audience. He mistook at a stroke the nature of the
context and the possibilities available to him. Futurism in British
variety was a subject <I>for</I> revue, not <I>in</I> revue, and framing
Luigi Russolo's electric noise machines (the <I>intonarumori</I>) at
the Coliseum was not enough to reposition them in some hybrid space as
other than entertainment or art.

Naturally I went to see the first performance, and I must say it was
one of the funniest shows ever put on in London, provided, of course,
that one looked at things from the right angle. Marinetti swaggered on
to that vast stage looking about the size of a house fly, and bowed. As
he spoke no English, there was no time wasted in explanations or in

<B></B>

the preparation of his audience. Had they spoken Italian, I do believe
Marinetti could have magnetized them as he did everybody else. There was
nothing for it, however, but to call upon his ten noise tuners to play,
so they turned handles like those of a hurdy-gurdy. It must have sounded
magnificent to him, for he beamed; but a little way back in the auditorium
all one could hear was the faintest of buzzes. At first the audience
did not understand that this was the performance offered them in return
for their hard-earned cash, but when they did there was one vast, deep,
and long-sustained, "Boo!" . . . When I went round to the back I found
Marinetti in the best of spirits, dismissing the unanimous condemnation
of the audience and calmly announcing to the Press, "C'&eacute;tait un
cabal." For the next performance Stoll introduced a gramophone record by
Elgar to bring a little melody into the act. It helped, and the effort
was received in stony silence. Marinetti described it as a "succ&eacute;s
[<I>sic</I>] fou" [<I>PP,</I> 61-62].

<P>
All this came to an abrupt end in August 1914. The artists continued their
activities, distracted or constrained in particular ways by the outbreak
of war, but Marinetti was no longer the caffeine of Europe; Futurists
and apaches (both copies and originals) changed into uniform; and the
avant-garde vanished from the illustrated press. In the <I>Sketch,</I>
the <I>Bystander,</I> the <I>Tatler,</I> and <I>Vanity Fair</I> there is
still material on pantomimes and music halls (with patriotic tableaux)
lightening the dark hours; there are fashion notes and exhortations to
keep the workers working in the fashion and entertainment industries. But
there are no references to Futurism or to fashionable patrons of the
avant-garde. The pages are filled with portraits of young widows, of
officers killed or wounded, of aristocratic women nursing or raising
money for the war effort. Lewis's patron Mary Borden Turner offers
an exemplary case, one no doubt heightened by the apparently intimate
relations between them. On 8 June 1914 she had confirmed the commission
to decorate her drawing room in Park Lane for &#163;250: &#163;100 in
advance and &#163;150 due on completion. ("I understand that you intend
painting six panels for the walls of the room but I leave the scheme of
decorations to you.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF159" HREF="#FOOT159">159</a></SUP>
 In August she thought of buying <I>Slow Attack</I> from an exhibition
 at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. By 31 December, with the panels nearly
 completed, she was uncertain how to proceed since the drawing-room scheme
 had had to be given up, at least temporarily. "I thought possibly in
 the meantime you might like to have them on Exhibition somewhere. People
 ought to have a chance to see them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF160" HREF="#FOOT160">160</a></SUP>
 In May 1915 she sent &#163;35, which brought the total payment to
 &#163;200. She was sorry not to enclose the last &#163;50 for the
 furniture and for decorating the room, but "Every penny I've got is
 going into my hospital."
<SUP><a NAME="REF161" HREF="#FOOT161">161</a></SUP>
 Later she wrote that she had expected to have a very unusual room, but
 that would have meant buying a complete

<B></B>

set of furniture, rugs, lamps, and so on, which was now impossible. She
would leave the walls plain and use her old furniture: "Please believe
that this is a matter of necessity and conscience."

 The next letter is from Dunkirk, dated 16 May [1916]; she is shutting
 up Park Lane and does not know what to do with the pictures, Lewis can
 exhibit them wherever he likes, and does he really want to come over and
 drive an ambulance (does he know anything about driving ambulances)? A
 final note offers a very frosty response to Lewis's request for the
 remaining &#163;50.

Claire Pajaczkowska has argued that just as Marx understood the product of
capitalist economics to be profit rather than commodities, so we should

 Modernism has, for historical reasons, a heightened autobiographical
 component, and "abstraction" may be less formal, or less reticent,
 than it appears. I would argue at the very least that certain forms of
 twentieth-century modernism have had as one of their principal objects
 the assertion of "virility and domination," in Carol Duncan's words, and
 that this assertion has been linked to a crisis in artistic masculinity
 and to the prominence of politically militant women.

Lewis's early writings, beginning in Brittany in the summer of 1908 and
culminating with the collection published as <I>The Wild Body</I> in
1927, can be related to <I>Kermesse,</I> where the drinks and revelry
and Breton hats suggest a local pardon.
<SUP><a NAME="REF166" HREF="#FOOT166">166</a></SUP>
 In notes written in Quimperl&eacute; in 1908 Lewis wrote that the
 peasants go to pardons "consciously with fatalism finding the starting
 point there of their orgies in the clamour, the multitude of the
 f&ecirc;te."
<SUP><a NAME="REF167" HREF="#FOOT167">167</a></SUP>
 The pardons, he insists, are "essentially <I>orgies</I>" dissipating
 the energies that might have fuelled rebellion or creativity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF168" HREF="#FOOT168">168</a></SUP>
 The dancers' Dionysian abandon thus entails abandoning intelligence,
 selfhood, and the detachment necessary for art or protest. It is at
 once vigorous and stupid. Art is opposed to life and--<I>pace</I> the
 symbolists--cannot aspire to the condition of dance. (We may note in
 passing that this view is at odds with the contemporary guidebooks, one
 of which explicitly stated that the Brittany pardons "are not excuses
 for drunken debauches, like the Flemish Kermess").

The Brittany stories illustrate what has been called Lewis's concept

person acting like a thing (or a machine), for Lewis the root of comedy
lies in perceiving a thing behaving like a person (a body behaving like
an intelligence). As Lewis's narrator Ker-Orr puts it in <I>The Wild

strange-scented, blond-skinned gut-bag, with its two bright rolling
marbles with which it sees, bull's eyes full of mockery and madness,
is my stalking-horse. I hang somewhere in its midst operating it with
detachment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF170" HREF="#FOOT170">170</a></SUP>
 The wild body, the physiological system, is the absurd and mechanical
 appendage handcuffed to the laughing observer.

<P>
Drawings like <I>The Vorticist</I>  are often viewed as comments on
modernity, as images of alienated man in the vortex of the modern city
(Foster, above,  8). They can be read that way, and their robotic
look attributed to the dehumanizing effects of modernity. But Lewis was
not a humanist. They serve I think a double and absolutely contradictory
purpose. On the one hand they <I>are</I> dehumanized and their look
of being automata, puppets, or insects, makes them cogs in the social
machine, will-less specks in the crowd or the herd. On the other hand
they represent a <I>desirable</I> dehumanization--and with pregnant
mistresses and venereal disease Lewis had problems with his own wild
body--a tempering and sheathing of the old "forked . . . blond-skinned
gut-bag" into a gleaming new Futurist masculinity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF171" HREF="#FOOT171">171</a></SUP>
 Like Marinetti, Lewis exempted the suffragettes (admired but patronized)
 from a general scorn for femininity. In his Nietzschean manifesto
 "The Code of a Herdsman" he described "women and the processes for
 which they exist" as "the arch conjuring trick."
<SUP><a NAME="REF172" HREF="#FOOT172">172</a></SUP>
 Tarr claims that "Surrender to a woman was a sort of suicide for an
 artist"; and that "soft, quivering and quick flesh is as far from art
 as an object can be."
<SUP><a NAME="REF173" HREF="#FOOT173">173</a></SUP>
 Women are here the death of art and, it is tempting to suggest, the
 revenge of the wild body. In a spectacularly redundant piece of advice
 Lewis's friend Sturge Moore warned him against any woman who used "the
 slop of sex" to trap him: "If [a man] puts his genius between her legs
 she will cover it with any petticoat that takes her fancy and no one
 will see it again."
<SUP><a NAME="REF174" HREF="#FOOT174">174</a></SUP>
 For Lewis all his rivals were enfeebled or in some way feminized. John
 had surrendered to his family romance and was buried in "tribes after
 tribes of archaic and romantic Gitanos and Gitanas."
<SUP><a NAME="REF175" HREF="#FOOT175">175</a></SUP>
 Sickert's low-life nudes squatting listlessly on Camden Town beds were
 squalid and d&eacute;mod&eacute;. Bloomsbury Post-Impressionism was
 the decoration of the "between-men"
<SUP><a NAME="REF176" HREF="#FOOT176">176</a></SUP>
 (and <I>Tarr</I>'s Alan Hobson, the average specimen of the "Cambridge
 set"--a hybrid of the Quaker, the homosexual, and the Chelsea artist).
<SUP><a NAME="REF177" HREF="#FOOT177">177</a></SUP>
 Cubism, more promising, was nevertheless passive before its
 apples and mandolins, producing from its studio props aptly-named
 <I>natures-mortes.</I> Futurist machismo on closer inspection was
 shrouded in Latin romance and so surrendered to the flux.
<SUP><a NAME="REF178" HREF="#FOOT178">178</a></SUP>
 Vorticism alone was hard and clean, unspent--in Pound's phrase, "art
 before it has spread itself into a state of flacidity"
<SUP><a NAME="REF179" HREF="#FOOT179">179</a></SUP>
--an aesthetic of the piston-rod, in Hulme's analogy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF180" HREF="#FOOT180">180</a></SUP>

<P>
The point is that subjectivity and the dance, primitivism and the machine,
are all about sex and "phallic aesthetics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF181" HREF="#FOOT181">181</a></SUP>
 They are all connected, and they are all unstable. The dance skirts
 femininity; the primitive, a bestial stupidity; the machine, a robotic
 mockery of masculinity. Yet each can be turned to secure the others,
 however contingently, <I>for</I> masculinity. Lewis's res do not
 carry the symbolic weight of gamboling nudity but have tensed anatomies
 that are crisp as foil, and indeterminate clothing like a carapace. The
 rhythm of life is violent and abrupt. "Nature" is combat

<B></B>

and schism, not the fecund paradise of <I>Les Eus.</I> The dancer is
not the thinking body, the undissociated sensibility, but the orgiastic
wild body, hysterical and stupid. At the same time, the mechanical forms
turn "soft, quivering and quick flesh" into art, offering a vocabulary
for what Lewis called in <I>Blast</I> "any heroic, that is, energetic,
representations of men to-day" ("RC," 44).

Lewis remains one of the most vigorous, intelligent, and challenging
artists and writers of the twentieth century. He is also one of the
most problematic: homophobic, misogynist, and politically right-wing
(charges perhaps only Joyce escapes among the "men of 1914" [<I>BB,</I>
249]). Writing about Yeats, an "extreme right-wing, sporadically fascist
writer," Terry Eagleton argues that "valuable art comes into being
not <I>despite</I> its historical limitations . . . but <I>by virtue
of</I> them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF182" HREF="#FOOT182">182</a></SUP>
 This is not a matter of the straightforward thrust of a progressive
 ideology through the constraints of the hegemonic formation, but
 rather of "a certain curvature in the ideological space" (<I>CI,</I>
 180) resulting from that formation being produced "from a particular
 dissentient conflictual position within it" (<I>CI,</I> 181). The
 analogy holds, I think, if we make the triple translation from Yeats
 to Lewis, from poetry to art, and from class to sex. The Victorian
 "sex-gender system" was shifting ground from various pressures,

<B></B>

including feminism, before World War I. Eagleton suggests that Yeats's
critique of bourgeois values could only come from the radical Right,
but for that very reason could not avoid being "warped, corrupted and
disabled" (<I>CI,</I> 180) by the moulds in which it was cast. Lewis's
implicit critique of art and sex--of the role of the body as an expressive
instrument, of Bergsonian vitalism, of the Salon cocotte, or Camden Town
nudes, or feminine embodiments of Nature and <I>Rhythm</I>--<I>might have
been feminist,</I> but was, in the end, similarly compromised. Women
are sexually threatening or sexually vulnerable rather than sexually
emancipated as moderns. In fact it is astonishing how rarely and
equivocally any image of the modern woman appears in the traditional
iconography of modernity; look, for instance, at the sprightly
vernacular of this new one-step called <I>Shopping</I> in 1911 (<A
HREF="4.2tickner_9.html"> 9</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF183" HREF="#FOOT183">183</a></SUP>
 The feminine is not precisely equated by Lewis with those "technically
 on the distaff side" but remains a framing device for the heterosexual
 masculine imaginary. Homosexuality is obsessively repressed (though that
 is another story). But with hindsight we might argue that in Vorticist
 circles at least, "phallic aesthetics" comes into a new and vivid
 visibility, not as a purely contingent accompaniment to the influence
 of Futurism and the move to abstraction, but at a moment of crisis in
 the relations between masculinity and representation that made that move
 urgent. This, as well as the dance--indeed via the dance as a resource
 in the choreography of sexual relations--is what the work is "of."

The enemy that dogs him [Lewis] in all his works is an excessive
taste for life. He is inclined to modify his forms in the interest
of drama and psychology to the detriment of pure design. At times his
simplifications and rhythms seem to be determined by a literary rather
than a plastic conception. Probably this is not the kind of criticism
which by now Wyndham Lewis must have learnt to disregard. He is more
accustomed, I suspect, to hearing his work called "mechanical" and
"lifeless" . . . [<I>Nation,</I> 25 October 1913, 172-73].

The spectacular expansion of the British popular press in the late
nineteenth century was based on the exploitation of new technology
(cheap paper and faster printing), advertising revenues, a high adult
literacy rate due to the Education Act of 1870, and a well developed
railway and distribution network. The <I>Daily News,</I> <I>Daily
Sketch,</I> <I>Daily Mirror,</I> and <I>Daily Mail</I> all built up
tremendous circulations in the late Victorian and Edwardian period
(the <I>Daily Mail,</I> founded in 1896, was soon selling a million
copies a day), and enhanced their appeal with photographic reproductions
popularized by the <I>Daily Mirror</I> in 1904 and the <I>Daily Sketch</I>
in 1909. See Michael Twyman, <I>Printing, 1770-1970</I> (London:

other forms of reproduction in the illustrated press both in size and
quantity, and photographs of "society" assume a prominence at first
accorded only to the stage and popular entertainers.

picked up on its use by the gangs themselves or by their neighbors,
who had all read Aimard; by whatever route, however, "l'Apache des
prairies est devenu l'Apache des faubourgs" (281 n. 10). M&eacute;ral

an influence on the French adventure novel, and that Eug&egrave;ne Sue

customs of the Indians" to "a different group of [urban] barbarians"

Mouton-Duvernet, Delambre, de la Grande Chaumi&egrave;re, and the
boulevard Raspail, all in Montparnasse, a stone's throw from streets
that had become the permanent theatre of scenes of violence on the
other side of the Luxembourg Gardens: around la place Maubert, the rues
Mouffetard, de la Harpe, Lagrange, the boulevard Saint Michel, and the
area immediately north of the Panth&eacute;on.

that the only way for Parisians to rid themselves of the apaches was
through the whip or the noose; the English, it suggested, had a better

she was a respectable wife and mother, but when her widower tried to ban
Jacques Becker's 1952 film (in which she was played by Simone Signoret),
Becker's lawyer successfully pleaded that her image belonged in collective

In fact the engagement at the Bouffes-du-Nord never materialized;
the theater was picketed by a group of fathers from the quartier de
la Chapelle, and the police planned to close it as a threat to public
order. The prefect L&eacute;pine placed an injunction on Le Bruyant's
cabaret after her first performances, and at the Salon the jury asked
Dupr&eacute; to withdraw his work from exhibition. On the trial, see

Berlanstein remarks on the Parisian workers' passion for dancing; he
points out that in the 1880s Saint-Denis, a town of about twenty thousand

and four cabarets (Berlanstein, <I>The Working People of Paris,</I> 127).

"I had not been considered beautiful enough to take part in the 'Jewel
Finale' in which the showgirls paraded as precious stones, ruby, diamond,
emerald, pearl," but Dearly taught her a new dance, saying, "'Never mind
the Jewels. I've found your stone for you--the paving stone. Mistinguett,
the 'pavement lily'" (Mistinguett, <I>Mistinguette:</I> [sic] <I>Queen of
the Paris Night,</I> trans. Lucienne Hill [London: Elek, 1954], 53). This
"brutal and tender" dance has "been imitated countless times, but always
on the basis of what Dearly and I, in our 'street corner apache' get-up,
created at the Moulin-Rouge" . Kees van Dongen painted Mistinguett and
Max Dearly in <I>La Valse Chaloup&eacute;e</I> (The apache dance), with
Mistinguett bending backwards with naked breasts, for "the requirements of
his canvas" . In 1919 Dearly and Mistinguett performed the apache
dance for the last time in <I>La Grande Revue,</I> a review of the
Moulin-Rouge in the days of La Goulue (106-7).

The apache was construed as specifically modern by both litterateurs
and politicians; see <I>CO,</I> 149, 204. For <I>Le Matin</I> in 1907
the type was unknown to a Balzac or a Sue, who could have drawn him
minutely, but was now widely prevalent in literature, so that one no
longer knew whether the apache had provoked a certain literature or
was the product of it; for Clemanceau, President of the Council in
1907, the apache was notable for his exploitation of the railways, the
telegraph, the telephone and all the <I>perfectionnements modernes</I>
(modern conveniences) for criminal ends. The captions four photographs
of the apache dance from <I>The Queen of the Moulin Rouge,</I> playing
in New York in 1909, spell out the narrative of sexual jealousy:

William Wees discusses the Cabaret Theatre Club in <I>Vorticism and the
English Avant-Garde</I> (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1972),
49-52, but the first substantial study of the club as an avant-garde
project is Richard Cork, "The Cave of the Golden Calf," <I>Artforum</I>
(December 1982): 56-68. This developed into the second chapter of
<I>Art Beyond the Gallery.</I> Any discussion of the Cabaret Theatre
Club is inevitably indebted to this pioneering account. I have drawn on
it selectively for my own ends, while adding some information of my own.

Mme. Frida Uhl Strindberg (1872-1943) was the playwright's divorced
second wife, and according to Nevinson, "the origin, or shall we say one
of the inspirations of Strindberg's tirades against women in general and
married women in particular" (<I>PP,</I> 41). Part of her motivation in
starting the club was apparently to perform Strindberg's plays in England,
although she had tried to start other supper- and nightclubs in London on
Percy Street and Hanover Square (<I>PP,</I> 41-42). Wees describes
her as given "to intense enthusiasms and histrionics" (<I>Vorticism
and the English Avant-Garde,</I> 49). She was in amorous pursuit of
both John and Lewis; in Lewis's case at least, the pursuit was probably
unsuccessful.

referring specifically to "entirely new creations" by Lewis that were
added to the existing works by Harold Gilman, Charles Ginner, Eric Gill,

at the Penguin," which opened at the Penguin Club, 8 East 15th St.,
New York, on 10 January 1917. The 1927 Quinn sale catalog describes
<I>Kermesse</I> (no. 382) as a "cubistic rendering of three festive
res, the central in rich yellow, the others in varying shades of red
and purple," and gives its dimensions as 8'9" high by 8'11" long. This
makes it slightly wider than its height, unlike the Yale <I>Kermesse,</I>
which is slightly higher than its width and has an additional strip of
paper pasted on to the original sheet, lengthening the design in ways
not evident in Brodzky's print. Quinn seems to have had second thoughts
about his purchase. In 1921 he wrote to Lewis, "I believe in you as a
thinker, as a writer and as an artist. But I don't think that you have
hit your pace in art yet. In the early days of the War I bought more
of your things than I should have bought then. The drawings I still
like, but those large, huge decorations, of an abstract kind are white
elephants in my hands" (Quinn to Lewis, 25 May 1921, Quinn Papers, New
York Public Library). According to annotations in the Tate Library copy
of the 1927 sale catalog, <I>Kermesse</I> was sold for only $15 and

For the moment, doubtless, many people will fail to allow themselves to
be influenced by this design, simply because they are not accustomed to
exert the passive attention to such a rhythmic disposition of abstract
units of form as this art demands. They are familiar enough with such an
attitude in music, but they are apt to turn crusty when it is demanded of
them by a painter. Fortunately, in the Albert Hall there is a method by
which any willing spectator may get a new <I>appercu</I> of such methods

A copy of the three-page contract is in the Wyndham Lewis Collection,
box 60, Cornell University. It required Mme. Strindberg to protect and
insure the painting and to pay &#163;10 in advance as the rental for
three months, from October to January [1912-13]; and for Lewis
to give her first offer on its purchase at the end of that period
for an additional &#163;20. The contract is quite clear that she has
expressed both "her desire to purchase his picture . . . for decorative
purposes in the CABARET THEATRE CLUB" and her inability "to pay the full
purchase sum of the picture viz. &#163;30" . This rather suggests that
<I>Kermesse,</I> which other evidence indicates was indeed commissioned
for, or at least intended as, a wall painting in the Cabaret Theatre
Club, was exhibited by Lewis in June when Mme. Strindberg failed to
find the money for it, and rented back to her in October as a way of
circumventing her financial difficulties, keeping it on display, and
enhancing its chances of purchase.

ugliness that events have put on me and which is not in my heart"

lectures under the exclusive management of the J. B. Pond Lyceum Bureau:
three on Strindberg; one on Walter Greaves, Whistler's pupil; one on
European artists and intellectuals including Paul Verlaine, Richard
Wagner, and Frank Wedekind; and one "From Aubrey Beardsley to Augustus

The cult of the dancer, with her speaking body and expressionless face,
was important to the symbolists as an emblem of the image of art. At
the same time a particular relationship existed for fin-de-si&egrave;cle
artists and sexologists between femininity, hysteria, and dance; for the
great women dancers of the period (like Loie Fuller or Isadora Duncan),
there was thus no necessary tension between their creativity and their
femininity, but at this cost: that, as Dijkstra puts it, "an entirely
new spectrum of creative expression . . . [was held to give] further
evidence of the hysterical eroticism and childlike nature of woman"
(Bram Dijkstra, <I>Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in
Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle Culture</I> [New York: Oxford University Press,
1986], 248). See Dijkstra for the relationship between Edward Carpenter,
Havelock Ellis, hysteria, and dance. See also Frank Kermode, <I>The
Romantic Image</I> (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1957) and Ian

September 1913, advertising its reopening in October, advertised not
only tango teas each weekday from four until six-thirty and the "Tango
Champagne" each night from half past midnight, but also the engagement
of Professor Raoul d'Alvez, the "most prominent Continental exponent of

Garafola points to Lewis's 1914 drawings of Nijinsky (hung in Countess

ventures to suggest "analogies between Nijinsky's rugged musculature,
displayed in revealing body stockings in <I>Spectre</I> and <I>Faune,</I>
and Lewis's dancing res of 1912, two of which the painter entitled
'Faunesque' and 'Seraglio'" (Lynn Garafola, <I>Diaghilev's Ballets

John Quinn to Augustus John, 3 February 1914, Quinn Papers, New York
Public Library. See also the photographs of "The Grizzly Bear," "The Bunny
Hug," "The Turkey Trot," and "The Tango" ("Terpsichorean Terrors Which are
Threatening to Undermine the Decorum of Our Ballrooms," <I>Tatler,</I>
27 March 1912, 355). The tango originated in the slums and bordellos of
Buenos Aires in the 1880s. Tourists had seen it danced in Montmartre or
Deauville, but the Gaiety revue <I>The Sunshine Girl,</I> which opened
in April 1912, was decisive in introducing it to a wider public as the
latest craze. It rapidly invaded the stage, the press, the ballroom,
the restaurant, and the private party, and its advance was unhindered by
letters of protest in the <I>Times</I> that denounced its lasciviousness
and feared for the safety of young girls at coming-out balls. Assisted by
occasional links to cubism in the press, tango enthusiasts and dancing
teachers stressed its modernity, and downplayed its eroticism, but it
seems likely that it was precisely this <I>danced</I> disruption of
the conventions of sexual decorum--this modernizing and primitivizing
move--that made the tango seem cognate with other forms of social
emancipation and avant-garde activity. Certainly the tango was a social
dance, companionate, and hence distinct from the apache dance (described
by tangoist Irene Castle as a form of exhibition dancing in which "the
male dancer tries to demolish the female dancer as spectacularly as
possible and usually succeeds" [Irene Castle, <I>Castles in the Air</I>
(Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday, 1958), 57]). But the acrobatic eroticism
was there in the dips, sways, entwined legs and backward bends.

<P>
Ragtime emerged out of black American music and dance forms around the
time of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, at the same time as new forms of
mass production, an increasing demand for sheet music, and new recording
and distribution techniques, ensured its widespread popularity. (Scott
Joplin's "Maple Leaf Rag" [1897, published 1899] sold more than a million
sheet-music copies in his lifetime.) Although ragtime bands appeared
in England earlier, ragtime's popularity was secured by <I>Hullo
Ragtime!,</I> which included such hits as "Hitchy-Koo" and "Waiting
for the Robert E. Lee" and secured the services of Irving Berlin for
its second edition. As with the tango, the origins, content, and force
of objections to ragtime--described by its detractors as hysterical,
negroid, and degenerate--probably added to its attractions in popular
entertainment. For its admirers (including Stravinsky), it was a genuinely
powerful and innovative resource for an original American music; for
its detractors (including Isadora Duncan), it represented a debased and
derivative aesthetic, an incitement to barbarism and hysteria. Francis
Toye takes this latter position, writing on "Ragtime: The New Tarantism"
in <I>The English Review</I> 13 (March 1913): 654-58; he has read
Jaques-Dalcroze on eurhythmics and concludes that the "false rhythms
and false movements" of ragtime are "allied with hysteria, neurosis and
nervous instability generally" .

<P>
Perhaps ragtime in the music hall or on the dance floor--modern dancing

"Rag-time" really covers the whole thing. We are living in an age of
rag-time. I was talking to a musical chap the other day, and he said
that when rag-time was properly digested we should get a big national
music. . . . Bergson is only ragtime in philosophy--you ignore the
regular beat of what is supposed to be, and catch on to the accent of
what you really feel. In fact, the difference between the old and the
new in art, science, morals and philosophy, is do you or don't you
syncopate? [<I>S,</I> 273]

By 1912 all three had performed in London. Flitch refers to Duncan
charming London audiences with her troupe of children "a year or so ago"
(<I>MD,</I> 109); Diaghilev's first London season in 1911 had drawn an
enthusiastic and fashionable response; Dalcroze and his followers had
already given demonstrations in London when the <I>Sketch</I> published
pieces on eurhythmics in its supplement on 28 August 1912, 10; and 24
September 1913, 8-9. After 1912 the <I>Dancing Times</I> is full of
advertisements for tuition in all forms of dance. Duncan and Dalcroze also
had an influence on Diaghilev. Duncan had influenced Mikhail Fokine on a
visit to Russia in 1905 (Walter Sorell, <I>The Dance Through the Ages</I>
[London: Thames and Hudson, 1967], 165). Diaghilev and Nijinsky paid
the first of two visits to Dalcroze in Hellerau in 1912 in preparation
for <I>The Rite of Spring</I>  and <I>Jeux</I> , which its
composer, Claude Debussy, found too "Dalcrozian" (<I>DB,</I> 60-61).

on rhythmical movement springing from the solar plexus as what Duncan
called "the temporal home of the soul," and which was feminist in its
assertion of feminine autonomy and procreative power (she scandalized her
audience by dancing when she was pregnant) was the absolute antithesis
of the kaleidoscopic, precision movements of chorus-line spectacle as
it was developing in music-hall revue (Isadora Duncan, <I>My Life</I>
[Garden City, N. Y.: Garden City Publishing, 1927], 341). Lewis may have
seen Duncan dance in Paris in 1908, or even met her through Kathleen
Bruce, a common acquaintance and studio-neighbour on the rue Delambre.

<I>Blast</I> announced its "violent boredom with that feeble Europeanism,
abasement of the miserable 'intellectual' before anything coming
from Paris, Cosmopolitan sentimentality, which prevails in so many
quarters" (Wyndham Lewis, "Manifesto--2," <I>Blast</I> 1, 34). Lewis
was later quite explicit about his distaste for the homosexual and
feminine fashionability of the Russian Ballet, first in <I>The Caliph's
Design</I>  but more specifically in <I>Time and Western Man</I>
, although there it is the postwar Russian Ballet that he calls
"a bastard 'revolutionary' article," the most perfect expression of "the
'revolutionary' High-Bohemia of the Ritzes and Rivieras," a restaging
of "the Nineties of Oscar Wilde and Beardsley" (Wyndham Lewis, <I>Time
and Western Man</I> [1927], ed. Paul Edwards [Santa Rosa: Black Sparrow
Press, 1993], 32, 33). The social and sexual connotations of Bloomsbury's
affection for Diaghilev's dancers would not have helped: see Peter Jacobs,
"'Quel D&eacute;cor!': Nijinsky Conquers Bloomsbury," <I>Charleston
Magazine</I> 9 (spring-summer 1994): 15-19. It is nevertheless
the case (and perhaps a mark of Lewis's perversity) that in 1919 he
divulged to John Quinn the "very great secret" that he was doing a set of
designs for a ballet "which I hope Diaghilev will take." It was apparently
a scheme of the Sitwell's, for which the young William Walton would write
the music. This was to be followed by "a Sea Ballet, scene at Deptford"
(Lewis to Quinn, 3 September 1919, Quinn Papers, New York Public Library).

Michael T. H. Sadler, "The Value of Eurhythmics to Art," 63. Hellerau was
the Dresden suburb where Dalcroze's Institut opened in 1911. Lewis's
1912 apaches, debauching peasants, or exterminating insects all
represent, in their various ways, the antitheses of such "new and
harmonious" ideals. In the Bergsonian scheme of things insects were the
most advanced representatives of instinct, at the opposite evolutionary
pole from human intelligence. This suggests that Lewis's antivitalism
did not prevent him from using a Bergsonian metaphor to cast his dancers
as mechanical, instinctual, and socially patterned (rather than humanly
expressive). This in turn sits well with his description of Futurism as
"flavoured strongly with H. G. Wells's dreams of the dance of monstrous
and arrogant Machinery, to the frenzied clapping of men's hands" (Wyndham
Lewis, "The Cubist Room," <I>Egoist,</I> 1 January 1914, 8-9);

See "FT," passim. Rainey's argument is principally concerned with the
impact of Futurism on the exploration of new social and commercial
spaces (and hence audiences) for avant-garde activity. "Il Teatro di
variet&agrave;" is translated as "The Variety Theater" in <I>Marinetti:
Selected Writings,</I> ed. R. W. Flint, trans. Flint and Arthur
A. Coppotelli (London: Secker and Warburg, 1972) 116-22; this
volume is hereafter abbreviated <I>SW.</I> "Il Teatro di variet&agrave;"
was originally published in <I>Lacerba</I> 1, 1 October 1913, and
in the <I>Daily Mail,</I> 20 November 1913. It was discussed in
the <I>Sketch,</I> 14 January 1914, 38. Marinetti also published a
"Manifesto of the Futurist Dance" (8 July 1917) and "Down with the Tango
and Parisfal" (a "Futurist letter circulated among cosmopolitan women
friends who give tango-teas and Parsifalize themselves, January 11,
1914" [<I>SW,</I> 69]), both reprinted in <I>SW,</I> 137-41,
69-71. The former manifesto praises Nijinsky, Duncan (if
ambivalently, as finally "childishly feminine" [<I>SW,</I> 137]), and
Dalcroze's rhythmic gymnastics ("which nevertheless limits its effects
to muscular hygiene and the description of the work of the fields"
[<I>SW,</I> 138]), at the expense of the explicitly Futurist dances of
Valentine de Saint-Point: "We Futurists prefer Louie [<I>sic</I>] Fuller
and the 'Cakewalk' of the Negroes (utilization of electric light and
mechanisms)" (<I>SW,</I> 138). Valentine de Saint-Point--the pseudonym
of Mme. Desglans de Cessiat-Vercell, author of the "Manifesto of the
Futurist Woman" --invented what she termed Futurist "metachoreia,"
accentuating the hard lines of limbs and muscles by veiling the
nonmuscular parts of the body, including the face. Photographs taken
at the Poirier Theatre, Paris, are reproduced in the <I>Sketch</I>
supplement, 7 January 1914, 5. Marinetti deemed this "pass&eacute;ist
poetry that navigates within the old Greek and medieval sensibility:
abstractions danced but static, arid, cold, emotionless" (<I>SW,</I>
138) and argued for Futurist dances derived "from the three mechanisms
of war" (<I>SW,</I> 139): the "Dance of the Shrapnel" (<I>SW,</I> 138),
the "Dance of the Machine Gun" (<I>SW,</I> 140) and the "Dance of the
Aviatrix" (<I>SW,</I> 141). When Marinetti writes that "One must go beyond
muscular possibilities and aim in the dance for that ideal <I>multiplied
body</I> of the motor that we have so long dreamed of. One must imitate
the movements of machines with gestures; pay assiduous court to steering
wheels, ordinary wheels, pistons, thereby preparing the fusion of man
with the machine, to achieve the metallicity of the Futurist dance"
(<I>SW,</I> 138), he invokes something like the steely surfaces and
multiple planes of Lewis's Yale <I>Kermesse.</I>

supply a page boy or secretary: also a stage for Theatrical Performances,

admonishing her for her response to his request for "the settlement of
an obligation" (<I>L,</I> 73). (He also asks if a painting en route to
her solicitors after the Dor&eacute; show can be forwarded to Quinn in

In the summer of 1908 Lewis was ill with venereal disease in Spain
and his German mistress, in a torturous but binding relationship, was
pregnant in Brittany with an unwanted child. Lafourcade does not mention
"Ida" when he views the summer in Brittany as critical for Lewis,
suggesting that he needed both to tear himself away, and to tame and
contain the intractability of Breton life in his fiction, and that he
resorted to certain devices--to Dickensian surreality or sociological
generalizations--to do so; see Bernard Lafourcade, "Afterword," in Lewis,
<I>The Complete Wild Body,</I> ed. Lafourcade, 403-14. I would argue
that in a parallel move, the influence of Futurism--marked after the
Sackville Gallery exhibition of March 1912--gave Lewis the tensed, dynamic
geometry that translated his early vitalism into formalism and delivered
the wild body to the laughing observer. It is himself he is remaking.

but he acknowledged that his hero was too like himself, and in a 1916
