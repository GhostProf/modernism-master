<p>
The poet H.D.'s film-related work of the late-1920s and early-1930s constitutes an important chapter in the history of female modernist theorizing about vision. Through her essays for the film journal <i>Close Up</i> (which she helped to found and edit), her participation in the POOL group's production of several silent films, and her autobiographically-inflected fiction of the period, H.D. participated in and helped to modify a number of discourses within modernist visual culture.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>


<p>
Looking at the body of work H.D. produced during this period for what it might tell us about the nature of modernist visuality, I am struck by a recurring image: that of a woman (H.D. herself or her fictional protagonists) fixedly staring. 
<a name="1" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#1">re 1</a>, from the 1930 film <i>Borderline,</i> suggests the level of intensity that H.D. as an actor and Kenneth Macpherson as her director invested in her stare: the image, a close-up of H.D. looking directly and intently into the camera, remains on screen for ten seconds. Other examples of the sustained, fixed stare abound in the film as well as in H.D.'s prose. In her 1926 story "Hipparchia," published the year before the founding of <i>Close Up,</i> the primary character is repeatedly characterized as "staring, wide-eyed," gazing fixedly, regarding, considering, contemplating, and not only looking but looking <i>and</i> looking. A paragraph describing Hipparchia's visual experience certainly suggests a cinema spectator fascinated and immobilized by patterns of light on a screen: "Her eyes, wide open, stared now upon the squares of neat ceiling . . . Her eyes saw light break across the ceiling, an angle of clear light. . . . She came back (staring, wide-eyed) to the 
<b></b>
ceiling across which the outer light had wandered."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 A well-known example of H.D.'s rapt, entranced gaze appears in her 1944 description of a hallucinatory vision she experienced in 1920: "I do not budge an inch or break the sustained crystal-gazing stare at the wall before me. . . . my own head is splitting with the ache of concentration. I know that if I let go, lessen the intensity of my stare and shut my eyes or even blink my eyes, the pictures will fade out."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>


<p>
What is H.D.'s stare, and why is it such a recurring feature of her representations and self-representations? What is the possible connection of her relentlessly fixed stare to the visual culture(s) of modernism? How and why is her film-related work so invested in an aesthetic of stasis? How was H.D.'s "involve[ment] with pictures" linked to the dynamics of her domestic m&eacute;nage in the late-1920s and early-1930s, which consisted of herself, her longtime female companion Bryher, and Macpherson (her bisexual male lover and Bryher's husband) and which formed the basis of the POOL film production company and the <i>Close Up</i> editorial board?
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 I suggest that investigating H.D.'s stare may tell us something about the contradictions and coexistences at the heart of modernist visuality and, more particularly, about the role of lesbian desire in the model of spectatorship emerging in her work.

<p>
H.D.'s abiding interest in stasis and fixity in visual experience runs counter to a significant discussion among her contemporaries about modern subjectivity and vision: that of the concept of "distraction" and its relation to mass cultural expressive forms, particularly the cinema. The nature of "distraction" was being extensively explored 
<b></b>
in the film criticism of Weimar Germany, where H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson spent time participating in Berlin's burgeoning film culture, seeing new films unavailable in England or Switzerland, and meeting directors like G. W. Pabst.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Many of H.D.'s German contemporaries, most notably Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin, theorized distraction as a peculiarly modern mass psychological state that developed in response to the fractures, shocks, and discontinuities of urban culture. These theorists presented "distraction" as a marked contrast to an older and allegedly outmoded model of attention: that of "contemplation" or "concentration." Concentration and contemplation were often associated in critical writing of this period with classical models of the Cartesian subject: coherent, stable, and occupying a relatively fixed position in relation to the visual object. The distracted subject, on the other hand, suggested a newly fragmented and destabilized model of subjectivity appropriate to the alienated conditions of modernity.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>


<p>
During the period that saw the establishment of the classical narrative film and large "picture palaces" in European capitals, which frequently interspersed film screenings with live vaudeville acts, the states of "distraction" and "contemplation" were often marked by class affiliation. The distracted spectator was generally associated with popular mass-cultural forms and with the urban working class, while the contemplative observer tended to be associated with the bourgeois subject engaged in a sustained relationship with the more traditional visual arts such as painting and sculpture.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 One tension that informs H.D.'s writing for <i>Close Up</i> is that between embracing a popular art form generally associated with "cheap circuses, crowds, . . . illiteracy . . . and . . . a sudden collapse of jerry-built scaffolding" and the desire to construct a more hermetic film culture associated with an exclusive community of avant-garde practitioners and audience members whom she identified as "picture adept[s]."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 H.D. attempted to resolve this tension by invoking a rapt, undistracted gaze in relation to this new and distracting art form.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 The "picture adept" who was the subject of this contemplative gaze was a contradictory creature, one invested in an aesthetic of cinematic stasis modeled on classical statuary but also sensitive to a set of peculiar filmic "vibrations." As I will explore later in the essay, perhaps the most adept of the "picture adepts" emerging as the ideal film audience in H.D.'s work was the lesbian spectator.

<p>
H.D. clearly articulates her aesthetic of cinematic stasis in the 1927 <i>Close Up</i> essay "Cinema and the Classics II: Restraint." In it, H.D. asserts that the primary visual model for a successful cinematic representation is classical Greek statuary ("a pre-fifth or fifth century piece of sculpture") and involves a focus on a single image or gesture, often stripped down to a synecdochic fragment.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 She claims that "[t]he pure classic does not depend for effect . . . on a whole, part has always been important, chiselling and cutting, shaping and revising. A laurel grove rises in one branch set against a plain room wall. . . . perhaps some little unexpected effect of a bare arm lifted might bring back . . . all of antiquity " ("CCR," 111, 114). H.D.'s stage directions for her translation of Euripedes's <i>Ion,</i> published in 1937 but composed in the late teens and the early 1930s, indicate a similar kind of attachment to stasis in dramatic performance: "Gesture may be simple, direct copy of marble arm and bared limb of pentellic frieze. . . . 
<b></b>
He may stand, in hieratic posture, scarcely moving, uttering frigid syllables like a marble statue."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>


<p>
H.D.'s focus on the single gesture and the static, statue-like image arises not only from her early training in imagism and a Paterian aesthetics that placed a high value on artistic "restraint" and the hieratic qualities of Greek statuary, but it also reflects two important developments in the theory and practice of European silent film.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 The first was the Weimar melodrama, which according to Patrice Petro, frequently employed fixed tableaux and "studied compositions at moments of narrative crises" that tended to break "with narrative suspense in favor of an attention to composition and atmosphere."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 The second development, emerging in French film criticism in the years immediately following World War I, shifted the focus from the action or narrative line of a film to the disruptive power of the single cinematic image, which French writers termed <i>photog&eacute;nie.</i>
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 The "photogenic" moment was one in which the single image, though part of a narrative trajectory, entered the foreground of spectatorial attention and, at the same time, gestured toward an enduring, Platonic "reality" beyond the surface image. For film critics such as Emile Vuillermoz writing in the late teens, the photogenic power of the single cinematic image was a remarkably static one: the cinema "cuts out of space and fixes in time inimitable images; [it] seizes in flight and immortalizes the fleeting moment when nature possesses genius" (qtd. in <i>FF,</i> 108). Moreover, for French theorists of <i>photog&eacute;nie,</i> this fixity extended beyond the cinematic image to include the spectator: in the photogenic conception of film, "the camera functioned as a mediator between the spectator and a certain reality or 'world' and as an instrument of revelation. . . . it positioned the spectator before that mediated reality . . . in a state of rapt attention or absorption" (<i>FF,</i> 107). The notion of film as an "instrument of revelation" is one that H.D. certainly supported; she often wrote of the cinema's ability to convey "something behind something," suggesting an unchanging Platonic essence beneath or beyond the surface of the cinematic image.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 This conception of film as a static, revelatory medium is very similar to Walter Pater's assumptions about the nature of Greek statues, which as Eileen Gregory has shown, were influential in the development of H.D.'s poetics. For Pater, classical statues "do not so much exemplify sublimity and nobility of form as they convey revelations of the invisible and eternal" (<i>HH,</i> 41).

<p>
Just as the concept of <i>photog&eacute;nie</i> establishes a defamiliarizing stasis in both image and spectator, H.D.'s valorization of the single, statue-like image within the film also constructs a fixed spectatorial gaze. When H.D. describes her experience of what she perceives as an excess of movement on the screen, her anxiety about its effect on the coherence of the seeing subject is clear: "Ben Hur drove his chariot with decorum and with fervour but . . . when I would begin to criticize I am lost myself in a tangle of exciting detail, am myself so startled and amazed by certain swiftness, certain effects of inevitable precise mass movement . . . that I lose my own clue, become sated and lost and tired" ("CCR," 111). In contrast to the "tangle of exciting detail" in the more dynamic film image that causes the spectator to get "lost," H.D.'s aesthetic agenda for the cinema involves, as she says, the search for the "one gesture (not too frigid and not 
<b></b>
too stagily static)" (ibid.). Her ideal film should, however, be "frigid" and "stagily static" enough to ensure the stability of the spectator's subjectivity:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The true classic is not a thing of built up walls . . . and pasteboard perspective. Streets and by-ways should be on one plane, we should be somewhere, not all over the place. We should be <i>somewhere</i> with our minds, lines should radiate as toward a centre not out and away from the central point of interest. . . . We should <i>be</i> somewhere, our getting on somewhere else will come in due course. ["CCR," 110-11]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
H.D.'s repeated, emphatic plea that "we should be somewhere" suggests an anxiety about visual excess&#8212;not only an excess of movement or objects within the visual field, but also an excess of motion in the spectator's visual attention, generated by an overly-complex set. H.D.'s aesthetic of viewing here seeks to fix the eye's wandering glances within a static, pared-down visual field.

<p>
H.D.'s search for a simplified visual field reflects a development in late-nineteenth-century psychology that defined <i>attention</i> as the ability and need to isolate some aspects of the perceptual field and to exclude others in order to organize sensory input and to ensure the stability of subjectivity. Jonathan Crary suggests that this concept of attention is central to the very notion of individual subjectivity in Western modernity, which "has demanded that individuals define and shape themselves in terms of a capacity for 'paying attention,' that is for disengagement from a broader field of attraction . . . for the sake of isolating or focusing on a reduced number of stimuli."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Similarly, in her fiction, H.D. defines art in terms of a delimiting focus: "The things are there all the time, but art [is] . . . a focus, a sense of proportion like turning the little wheel of an opera glass, getting a great mass of inchoate colour and form into focus, focussing on one small aspect of life though really it is only a tiny circle, a tiny circle."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>


<p>
The same contemplative, concentrated, focused attention that H.D. invokes to suggest the possibility of a stable, undistracted relationship to the usually distracting cinematic image was itself understood during the early-twentieth century as closely related to the <i>breakdown</i> of stable vision, subjectivity, and identity. In a 1927 <i>Close Up</i> editorial, Kenneth Macpherson describes an entranced state of excessive visual fixation that he claims is the lamentable result of viewing inferior (most likely popular) films: "when the film is not good enough to keep the brain working, the public sinks into a kind of hypnotic daze. The screen, with its changing forms becomes something in the nature of a crystal, and the public in the nature of a crystal gazer. Mind in some way neatly obliterates itself."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 The state that Macpherson describes, one in which the absorbed, rapt gaze contributes to an obliteration or destabilizing of vision and subjectivity, resonates with Crary's notion of "suspension" as a salient quality of modern attention. Crary, drawing on the work of late-nineteenth-century psychologists, defines attentive suspension as "a looking or listening so rapt that it is an exemption from ordinary conditions, that it becomes a suspended temporality, a hovering out of time" (<i>SP,</i> 9). This is a state that blurs the distinction between concentration and the far more unpredictable and unmanageable states of reverie, trance, or dissociation. This fixated attention, verging on more trance-like states, involves both an intensification of 
<b></b>
perception and, <i>as a result</i> of this intensification, "a cancellation or an interruption . . . a disturbance, even a negation of perception itself" (<i>SP,</i> 10). Others during the first half of the twentieth century commented on this phenomenon, in which the intense stare actually limits and even disables perception. For example, Aldous Huxley noted that if through dependence on "artificial lenses or bad habits," the gaze grows too fixed and the eye loses its mobility, and thereby its ability to scan objects, "the sensory apparatus undergoes distortion and vision degenerates. . . . In his greedy anxiety to achieve his end, which is to the greatest possible amount of good seeing in the shortest possible time, the starer neglects the only means whereby this can be achieved."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>


<p>
The "crystal-gazer" with "bad habits" whose fixed stare borders on trance or cognitive dissociation makes frequent appearances in H.D.'s prose fiction of the 1920s. One example, from the novel <i>Asphodel,</i> demonstrates the kind of suspended attention that Crary describes: "Hermione stared at the wall. . . . Her eyes seemed to see nothing. Were open, staring like glass eyes, saw nothing, grey glass eyes, but her eyelids seemed pricked with luminous light, seemed to burn, to glow with some light within&#8212;<i>eyes and they see not</i>&#8212;her glass grey eyes didn't see anything, would never see anything" (<i>A,</i> 201).

<p>
In the fictional work that features this kind of hallucinatory suspended attention, the cause of this perceptual state is often related to a variety of lesbian desires and encounters. <i>(HER)mione, Asphodel,</i> and "Hipparchia" all represent lesbian relationships resembling those in H.D.'s own life (primarily her early relationship with Frances Gregg and her later relationship with Bryher). The texts describe these relationships not only in terms of vision, but also in terms of intense, rapt staring and shared hallucination and trance&#8212;states very similar to the suspended attention that marks Macpherson's "crystal-gazing" moviegoer. For example, in <i>Asphodel,</i> Hermione travels to France with her female lover, Fayne Rabb, and visits Rouen, the city where Joan of Arc was tried and executed. Hermione describes Joan in terms that echo late-nineteenth-century sexologists' definitions of the sexual invert&#8212;"a girl who was a boy"&#8212;and closely associates Joan's religious visions with Hermione's and Fayne's habit of "seeing things . . . having 'visions,' seeing things like she did and like Fayne Rabb."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 In fictional episodes that parallel H.D.'s first meeting with Bryher, the Bryher-like characters are repeatedly represented as intense starers equipped with "eyes that looked and looked" (<i>A,</i> 178; "H," 92, 94). Her protagonists respond not only by participating in a mutual, mirroring gaze ("staring back into eyes that stared and stared" [<i>A,</i> 175]; "regarding a pair of beryl eyes that looked and looked" ["H," 92]) but also by hallucination: "Don't let me get hysterical for she makes me see things" (<i>A,</i> 175, 180). I wish to suggest that it is precisely this kind of contradictory, suspended attention&#8212;rapt, fixated, and absorbed as well as destabilized and ungrounded&#8212;that emerges as a model for spectatorial subjectivity in H.D.'s film work, and it is one that is repeatedly associated with the literally entrancing effects of lesbian desire throughout H.D.'s oeuvre.

<p>
In her film writing, H.D. observes, admires, and attempts to represent and elicit such a state of entranced, suspended attention in her description of the photogenic, static aspects of Alexandra Khokhlova's performance in Lev Kuleshov's 1926 film <i>By the Law.</i> She writes:



<b></b>
<p>


<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The gestures of this woman are angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous. . . . Her gestures are magnificent. If this is Russian, then I am Russian. . . . this woman is a sort of bleak young sorceress, vibrant, febrile, neurotic . . . almost cataleptic. She has one authentic mad scene: her mind breaks after hours of watching the prisoner with the gun placed edge-wise like some iron bar-across numbed and frozen knees. . . . Her mind is on the raw edge of breaking. . . . Her mind, her soul, her body, her spirit, her being, all vibrate . . . almost audibly.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
As with the single images and pared-down stage sets that H.D. posits as the cinematic ideal, her admiration of this film is based on Khokhlova's static, "numbed and frozen" qualities&#8212;a stasis that borders, as she says, on catalepsis, and yet is also characterized by intense "vibration." As suggested in <a name="2" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#2">res 2</a> and <a name="3" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#3">3</a>, Khokhlova conveys this psychological condition through eyeball-exposing, rapt staring&#8212;images of which, like the image of H.D. staring into the camera in <i>Borderline,</i> remain on the screen for at least ten seconds. I would suggest that H.D. is not only admiring an actress' ability to represent the seemingly contradictory state of vibrant catalepsis; her film-related work also posits a model of spectatorial response that encompasses both qualities. H.D. offers herself as a model of just such a spectator when she explicitly identifies with Khokhlova's image ("if this is Russian, then I am Russian") and announces that "I, personally, am attuned to certain vibration" emanating from the screen, which, she claims, Kuleshov "uses . . . almost as a psychic medium" ("E," 127).

<p>
H.D.'s identification with Khokhlova's simultaneously vibrant and cataleptic screen image might be read not only as a model for spectatorial response, but even more specifically as a set of directions for viewing her <i>own</i> screen image. When H.D. saw <i>By the Law</i> in 1928, she had already appeared in <i>Wing Beat</i> and would act in two more POOL films <i>(Foothills</i> and <i>Borderline</i>) within the next two years. Images of H.D. in <i>Borderline</i> (<a name="1" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#1">. 1</a>, <a name="4" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#4">4</a>, <a name="5" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#5">5</a>, and <a name="6" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#6">6</a>) might easily be described with the same language she uses to describe Khokhlova: "angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous"; "vibrant, febrile, neurotic"; "almost cataleptic"; demonstrating "an agony of neurotic almost epileptic strength"; "a great locust, all legs, hardly any flesh" ("E," 128, 129).

<p>
H.D.'s focus on both the simultaneously static and vibrant aspects of Khokhlova's screen image also bears a striking resemblance to the language of a full-page advertisement in <i>Close Up</i> for the POOL group's 1927 film <i>Wing Beat</i>: "Telepathy and attraction, the reaching out, the very edge of dimensions in dimensions, the chemistry of actual attraction, of <i>will</i> shivering and quivering on a frail, too-high, too inaccessible brink. WING BEAT shakes and trembles from its first moment. . . . Of minds and spirits, not of persons."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Like H.D.'s description of Khokhlova, the rhapsodic language of the ad emphasizes both stasis and vibration. There is a dearth of active verbs and complete sentences, which are replaced mostly by a series of apposite nouns or noun phrases and gerunds. The verbs that <i>are</i> here (shivering, quivering, shakes, trembles) signal the most minute of movements, almost not movement at all, but rather something in between stasis and movement, perceived haptically or psychically, rather than visually.



<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 416]</b>


<p>
H.D. uses a similar vocabulary of stasis and vibration in an unpublished essay on the film <i>Wing Beat:</i>

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
So the world beats and pulses in this modest four reel film. . . . But it is a world of reality, of a simple setting, a lyric setting and to all intents and purposes, no action. The action . . . is the action of subtle "stills," an action of thought etched in fine distinguished line on the fine distinguished features of Mr. Macpherson and of H.D., the writer, poet-critic who has taken part in the film. . . . This is the world lived by the nervous, post-war thinker, artist, intellectual; nerve-wrought, hysterical . . . but vibrant, pulsing with life and with rarefied emotion.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
In H.D.'s description of her own screen image, the only "action" is that of emotionally rarefied "stills," reminiscent of the significance-laden fixed tableaux of expressionist film melodramas. These nerve-wrought, hysterical, vibrant, pulsing "stills" also recall the nervous condition found in Walter Pater's description of the daughters of Herodias, oracular priestesses who, according to Eileen Gregory, served H.D. as models for the "visionary female artist": "Nervous, electric, faint always with some inexplicable faintness, these people seem to be subject to exceptional conditions, to feel powers at work in the common air unfelt by others" (qtd. in <i>HH,</i> 81).

<p>
The "film still" that constitutes the focus of female spectatorial identification here also makes an appearance in later feminist film theory's depiction of the gendered dichotomy of stasis and movement that adheres to the classical narrative film. Teresa DeLauretis describes this dichotomy when she claims that, "the female spectator is 
<b></b>
classically split between" on the one hand, identification with "the image on the screen, perceived as spatially static, fixed," and feminine, and on the other hand, "identification with the camera, apprehended as temporal, active," and masculine.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 H.D.'s description of the experience of working under Macpherson's direction in the making of <i>Borderline</i> clearly reflects this dichotomy, as Macpherson appears engaged in frantic directorial activity, arranging and posing his rather lumpish actors, including H.D. herself:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
He directs an elaborate series of overhead and side and ground lights, he writes a script which he meticulously illustrates with a series of some 1,000 pen sketches, he chooses his troop of players, he poses them, he all but acts for them, he directs from behind the camera while all the time he himself is concerned with the elaborate one-man mechanism of various stops, different focuses, indeterminate "pans" up and down, and the very tricky job of the sheer turning.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
It is clear that H.D.'s position as a film spectator and critic is heavily influenced by her experience as a film actor and by her (idealized) perceptions of her own screen image. It is tempting to read her act of looking at the vibrant/cataleptic woman on the screen as a form of extended, contemplative self-regard. The image of her looking at her own and other female images looking back at her via the camera would seem the apotheosis of Mary Ann Doane's description of the female spectator of classical Hollywood film, for whom "there is a certain overpresence of the image&#8212;she <i>is</i> the image" and whose "desire can be described only in terms of a kind of narcissism."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Understood in this way, H.D.'s rapt, absorbed gaze is at its most intensely absorbed when she is looking at her own screen image looking back at herself.

<p>
Such a narcissistic model of female spectatorship might present particular anxiety for a lesbian spectator, particularly one who, like H.D., was familiar with the work of sexologists like her and Bryher's friend Havelock Ellis, an early proponent of the association of the myth of Narcissus with autoeroticism and homosexuality.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 As Carolyn Allen has observed, the discourses of modern sexology "pathologize[d] the same-sex erotic dynamic as extreme self-enclosure under the rubric of narcissism." H.D.'s film-related writing evidences a dismayed awareness of the pejorative aspects of the "narcissist" construction of lesbian erotics, but it also offers a potentially redemptive revision of "narcissism" for a lesbian aesthetics of cinematic relations.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>


<p>
H.D.'s descriptions of her own domestic and sexual m&eacute;nage with Bryher and Macpherson, particularly her relationship to Bryher within the m&eacute;nage, evidence her concerns about the potentially stultifying, petrifying effects of both cinematic spectatorship and lesbian erotics.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 In a 1928 letter, she described her relationship with Bryher and Macpherson as "very static and 'classic,'" exactly the terms she uses to describe her ideal film aesthetic.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 However, this "static and classic" relation, especially with Bryher, is also marked by unease, visible in a set of metaphors describing the lesbian body as a machine, in particular a photographic machine. In the 1928 story "Narthex," which offers a fictional account of a trip H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson took to Venice around the time of Bryher's and Macpherson's marriage, H.D.'s protagonist
<b></b>
and fictional alter ego Raymonde describes her female lover Gareth as a "steel blue recorder" and complains to her male lover Daniel that "'Gareth is purely mechanical in all her reaction. . . . she sees me rather than perceives me. . . . She watches me . . . watching. She doesn't want to watch me absorbing. She wants to watch me watching.'"
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Gareth in this formulation <i>is</i> a film camera, engaged in a mechanical "seeing" rather than a more engaged "perceiving." Moreover, Raymonde suggests that Gareth's desire seeks to elicit a similar kind of mechanical vision&#8212;"watching" rather than "absorbing"&#8212;in Raymonde, portraying the two women as a pair of film cameras, mutually engaged in mechanical, inhuman vision.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>


<p>
In the pamphlet she wrote to accompany <i>Borderline,</i> H.D. also refers to Macpherson as a "machine man" whose body is coextensive with the camera he uses to shoot the film in which she and Bryher appear: "Kenneth Macpherson, at work, is a hard-boiled mechanic, as if he himself were all camera."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 However, this conflation of machine and male lover/film director appears as a productive hybridization of body and machine and seems to generate none of the dyslogistic associations of the mechanized Gareth, who is several times called a "robot" in H.D.'s 1928 fiction <i>The Usual Star.</i>
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The concern about mechanistic vision, associated here particularly with lesbian relations, reflects an anxiety that, according to Louis Commoli, accompanied the rise of photography: "the human eye loses its immemorial privilege; the mechanical eye of the photographic machine now sees <i>in its place,</i> and in certain aspects with more sureness. The photograph stands as the triumph and grave of the eye."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 The image of the lesbian couple as a matched pair of film cameras suggests a completely mechanized narcissistic gaze, one in which the lesbian body itself serves as the "triumph and grave of the eye."

<p>
H.D.'s linking of the lesbian body to the narcissistic machinery of the camera and robot echoes her ambivalence about the rise of sound in cinema. Puzzling over her disappointment in a sound film starring the Spanish singer Raquel Meller, she claimed that "[t]he screen image, a mask, a sort of doll or marionette was somehow mechanized and robbed of the thing behind the thing that has grown to matter so much to the picture adept. A doll . . . became a sort of robot" ("CCM,"115). Although she is dealing here with a set of metaphors for the screen image quite different from classical statuary, the doll, like the marble statue, still retains a potentially revelatory quality, capable of granting to the "picture adept" access to "the thing behind the thing," the Platonic <i>eidos</i> lingering behind the <i>photog&eacute;nie</i> of the silent film image. The singing "robot," however, seems to close off this access, reducing the cinematic experience to a mere surface image. No depth, no absorption, no perception: only a superficial engagement with the readily reproducible mechanical entity and mechanically-generated image. Returning to Raymonde's complaint that "[s]he wants to watch me watching" as a dystopic mechanization of the dynamic of female lovers "staring back into eyes that stared and stared," we can read in H.D.'s work an anxiety about the specter of lesbian erotics as an endless mechanical <i>mise en ab&icirc;me,</i> reminiscent of the female spectator locked in a "narcissistic" engagement with the female screen image looking back at her.



<b></b>

<p>
H.D. reported with pleasure her engagement with film technology; she noted in her response to a 1929 <i>Little Review</i> questionnaire, "I myself have learned to use the small projector" and "can do a little work on the small camera."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 However, there lingers in her work a profound apprehension about the mechanical aspects of cinema&#8212;not only its "appliances" and "intricate machinery," but the mechanical generation and reproducibility of its images ("CCM,"114). This apprehension is linked in her writing to the pejorative sexological claims of narcissism that tend to gather around the lesbian body. H.D.'s emphasis on contemplative, even worshipful absorption in the film image, her suspicion of the cinematic "robot," and her valorization of the photogenic film image's ability to offer the "picture adept" access to the hermetic "thing behind the thing," participated in what Walter Benjamin perceived as a mistaken effort of film critics in the late 1920s to establish the "ritual" or "cult value" of the cinematic image, despite the fact that the mechanically-reproduced film image was detached from the "aura" of the "authentic," mechanically-unreproducible art work.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>


<p>
However, H.D.'s attempt to establish the cult value of the film image involved another agenda as well: rescuing lesbian desire from the damaging associations of narcissism, troped here not so much as self-reflection but rather as mechanical reproducibility. One method by which H.D. attempts to address and resolve her apprehension about the "robotic" aspects of lesbian desire involves her vibrant-cataleptic mode of film performance and reception. This method is closely connected to her recurrent valorization of the classical statue as the model not only for the cinematic image but for lesbian erotics. By describing lesbian desire in terms not only of the petrifying, narcissistic vision-machine or robot but rather in terms of the simultaneously static and vibrant classical statuary which forms the basis for her cinema aesthetic, she attempts to represent what Allen has described as a sexual "relation of identity layered with res of alterity," an erotics based on a shifting balance of identity and difference.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>


<p>
This kind of erotics is evidenced in the novel <i>(HER)mione,</i> composed in the late 1920s, when the protagonist Hermione (or Her), envisioning herself as a statue, conflates her own name both with the feminine object pronoun and her female lover: "Keep a marble self for a marble self, Her for Her, Her for Fayne exactly."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Several readers have observed that H.D. often associates classical statuary with lesbian sexuality, particularly lesbian sexuality understood as <i>both</i> homoerotic and autoerotic.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 The lesbian statuary that emerges here is not purely static, but also the animated, vibrant statuary of H.D.'s "restrained" cinematic ideal. An erotic encounter between Hermione and Fayne is described in terms of a cinematic experience, complete with curtains parting to reveal a screen close-up: "Her bent forward, face bent toward Her. A face bends toward me and a curtain opens. There is swish and swirl as of heavy parting curtains. . . . Curtains part as I look into the eyes of Fayne Rabb. 'And I&#8212;I'll make you breathe, my breathless statue.' 'Statue? You&#8212;<i>you</i> are the statue.'"
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>


<p>
With its heavy-breathing (or at least the promise of heavy-breathing) sexual rapport between the closely-identified female spectator and the female image, both of whom are characterized as "statues" animated by their cinematic/sexual encounter, this passage 
<b></b>
suggests the sort of "picture adept" H.D. is attempting to model in her film writing. The female spectator thereby engages autoerotically <i>and</i> homoerotically with a female screen image that is both self and other, static and animated, or, like Khokhlova's and H.D.'s own screen image, cataleptic and vibrant. H.D.'s simultaneously contemplative and distracted or "suspended" stare at the female screen image that is both self and other anticipates Roland Barthes's claim that "Photography is the advent of myself as other" and indicates her contribution to modernist women's theorizing of lesbian desire in the age of mechanical reproduction.
