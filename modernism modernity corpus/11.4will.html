In 1941, the Jewish-American writer Gertrude Stein embarked on one of the strangest intellectual projects of her life: translating and introducing for an American audience the speeches of Marshal Philippe P&#x000E9;tain, head of state of the collaborationist Vichy government. During the next two years, from 1941 to 1943, Stein translated some thirty-two of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches into English, including those that announced Vichy policy barring Jews and other "foreign elements" from positions of power in the public sphere, and those that called for a "hopeful" reconciliation with Nazi forces. The last of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches that Stein translated was from August 1941, but Stein did not cease working on the project until January or February 1943&#x02014;several months after the Germans had occupied P&#x000E9;tain's Free France in November of 1942, and long after the United States had entered the war against the fascist forces Stein was promoting to her fellow Americans. Never published, the translation manuscript was forgotten from Stein's death in 1946 until critic Wanda Van Dusen effectively "outed" the project as a work of Vichy propaganda in a 1996 issue of .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Van Dusen's own untimely death arrested this investigation, and since then&#x02014;notwithstanding a recent expos&#x000E9; in <i>The New Yorker</i> on Stein's Vichyite activities&#x02014;there has been no sustained scholarly interpretation of the translation project's significance.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Why and under what terms would Stein undertake to translate P&#x000E9;tain's speeches for an American audience? Van Dusen's analysis focuses on the introduction Stein wrote to accompany the translation project, finding in it ample proof that Stein was a willing collaborator, that she signed on to the project out of ideological 

<b></b>

conviction and commitment to the re of the Mar&#x000E9;chal. Stein's lifelong belief in "internal essences" and her fetishization of the re of the general or "great man" inform Van Dusen's critique, which also works to counter our contemporary understanding of Stein as an intellectual and artistic iconoclast&#x02014;seemingly the least likely person to engage actively with the production of fascist ideology.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In Van Dusen's analysis, Gertrude Stein the unquestionably "progressive" writer&#x02014;the originator, in works like <i>Three Lives</i> (1904-06), <i>Tender Buttons</i> (1912-14), and <i>The Making of Americans</i> (1903-12), of a radically antiauthoritarian, antipatriarchal poetics&#x02014;becomes Stein the willfully unseeing, pro-Vichy mythographer. Interestingly, what Van Dusen fails to mention&#x02014;that Stein pursued the P&#x000E9;tain translation project into 1943&#x02014;is perhaps the most shocking aspect of this strange undertaking. It is one thing to profess the belief, shared with much of the French population, that P&#x000E9;tain would save France from the internal and external forces that had brought it to its difficult pass in 1940; but Stein's unwavering commitment to the translation project in the face of an obviously changing political climate&#x02014;and in the face of massive, state-sponsored deportations of Jews from the region in France where Stein was living&#x02014;is hard to comprehend. In short, Stein's efforts seem to go above and beyond what was needed to be seen as accommodationist toward the Vichy regime. 
</p>

<p>
Van Dusen's analysis has been criticized for its tendentiousness,<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  but it remains a powerful indictment of Stein; still, what is lacking in her essay is any analysis of the translations themselves, including their gaps and silences, the points of struggle and even resistance written into the very texts. The ready condemnation of Stein as a Vichy collaborator seems to foreclose a more nuanced reading of the "collaborationist" texts themselves (just as, for too long, analyses of Stein's aesthetic have tended to ignore the historical and political context within which she was writing). Indeed, no scholar has yet attempted a close reading of the translations, nor placed them in the context of Stein's own problematic relationship to the task of translation as it emerged in the early 1930s. This essay will aim to do that, focusing on both the literary/linguistic aspects of Stein's translations and on their historical/biographical context. I will suggest that whatever the terms of Stein's decision to embark on the P&#x000E9;tain translation project, there is little doubt that it occasioned both anxiety and uncertainty: if this was a performance in support of Vichy, it was not one of absolute conviction. Beyond the fact that Stein entered into this project at a moment of grave personal threat, and possibly in exchange for her own safety, there is also a disjunction between the way the speeches are translated and their larger propagandistic goal. Hence the conviction that Van Dusen sees in Stein's introduction to the translations needs to be weighed against the feeling of coercion that seems to underlie the translations themselves, as though "something outside" were compelling Stein to produce a form of writing antithetical to her aesthetic principles. Seen in light of Stein's early professed <i>resistance</i> to the very idea of translation, her central belief in "genius," and her uneasy relationship to audiences, the P&#x000E9;tain project seems doubly strange: an anomalous undertaking in relation to the rest of Stein's oeuvre, and one that, I will argue, needs to be placed within the historical context of Stein's lived experience during the Second World War. The point here is 

<b></b>

not to justify the P&#x000E9;tain project, but rather to interrogate any easy verdict of "collaboration" as it appears at first glance to pertain to the case of Stein.

<p class="noIndent">
The P&#x000E9;tain translations reside in a folder in the Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University: several manuscript notebooks, a few typed pages, and the typescript of the introduction Stein wrote to accompany the translations. The first speech translated is P&#x000E9;tain's address of 1936, delivered at the inauguration of a monument to the veterans of Capoulet-Junac; the last, P&#x000E9;tain's 1940 Christmas address. Stein followed the erratic chronology of the original text, <i>Paroles aux Fran&#x000E7;ais; messages et &#x000E9;crits 1934-1941,</i> translating approximately the first half of the fifty speeches published. Still, she leaves some speeches untranslated, and it is interesting to speculate as to why. Speeches discussing the education of French youth, regional administration, and French legionnaires may have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of popular American audience Stein was ostensibly trying to court, but Stein also leaves untranslated a speech on Franco-Canadian relations which argues for cross-cultural understanding, and a speech announcing P&#x000E9;tain's desire to form a Supreme Court "as is found in the United States."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Whether or not these omissions were deliberate, they raise a central question: was Stein herself involved in the selection of these translations, or was she a mouthpiece for someone else's directives?
</p>

<p>
Stein's notoriously bad handwriting is especially pronounced on these pages, and the manifold corrections in the hand of Alice Toklas only exacerbate the difficulty of reading. But what is most striking about the text is its literal rendering of the French original. Translating word by word, Stein completely ignores questions of idiom or style: "Telle est, aujourd'hui, Fran&#x000E7;ais, la tache &#x000E0; laquelle je vous convie" becomes "This is today french people the task to which I urge you" (<i>PF,</i> 88).<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  An idiomatic phrase such as "Le 17 juin 1940, il y a aujourd'hui une ann&#x000E9;e" (<i>PF,</i> 121) becomes "On the seventeenth of June 1940 it is a year today." "Ils se m&#x000E9;prendront les uns et les autres" (<i>PF,</i> 165)&#x02014;a speech denouncing P&#x000E9;tain's critics&#x02014;is translated "But they are mistaken the ones and the others." Syntax is distorted: a speech describing the refugees from the Lorraine notes the abandonment of "le cimeti&#x000E8;re o&#x000F9; dorment leurs anc&#x000EA;tres" (<i>PF,</i> 177); Stein translates this as "their cemeteries where sleep their ancestors." Even the term "speech" is avoided: "Discours du 8 juillet" (<i>PF,</i> 125) becomes "Discourse of the 8 July." 
</p>

<p>
Given Stein's apparent goal to familiarize an American audience with P&#x000E9;tain's words, these translations seem incongruous, even inept. Arguably, this is the work of a writer with little or no real familiarity toward the foreign language being translated. Alice Toklas's corrections&#x02014;more copious and directive than in other of Stein's texts she copyedited&#x02014;affirm this assessment of Stein as a bungling student reaching beyond her linguistic depth. Yet the weakness of the translations seems to belie Stein's fluency as a reader and relative fluency as a writer of French at this point in her life.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Not only had Stein long been a reader of French&#x02014;her early reading of Flaubert's <i>Trois Contes</i> 

<b></b>

had famously informed her breakthrough experimental text, <i>Three Lives</i>&#x02014;but she had recently finished an original composition in French (<i>Picasso,</i> 1938). More than a decade before the P&#x000E9;tain translation project, moreover, she had felt confident enough to embark on a translation into English of a text that would stretch the skills even of a Francophone: the poem cycle <i>Enfances</i> by the French surrealist poet Georges Hugnet. 
</p>

<p>
Placing the P&#x000E9;tain project in the context of the earlier Hugnet project proves illuminating. In 1930, Stein offered to translate George Hugnet's <i>Enfances</i> into English as a favor in return for Hugnet's own translation and publication, a year earlier, of sections of <i>The Making of Americans</i>. Translating Hugnet was an ambitious task, given the length and complexity of the original. Stein soon ran into difficulties with the project, although in her own retrospective account she insisted that these difficulties had nothing to do with either her own language skills or with <i>Enfances</i>. Rather, it was the very act of translation that preoccupied and disconcerted Stein: changing a text from its original into another form seemed to her to be, ultimately, a passive rather than a creative act, an act of "carrying out an idea already which was already existing," of conveying a "recognition [that] was prepared beforehand."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Translation thus became the signifier for a mode of writing that threatened the nature of what she called "genius." 
</p>

<p>
This is a more complex problem for Stein than one might initially think. For Stein, "genius" was a key term, descriptive most notably and notoriously of her own essential type (as when she has Alice Toklas extravagantly identify her in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> as one of "only . . . three first class geniuses" Alice has ever met).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Yet Stein also described "genius" as precisely that which resisted typologization: an ongoing <i>process of dialogue</i> between self and other, subject and object, inside and outside: a process of relationality between two entities, or even two signs. In <i>Lectures in America</i>  she refers to "being a genius" complexly as "being one who is at the same time talking and listening," a phrase that emphasizes both "being" (Stein the genius/type) and dialogic process ("at the same time talking and listening") (<i>LA,</i> 170).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  There is a crucial tension in this and other similar descriptions between "genius" as authorial originality and "genius" as an ideal relationality, a process of pure difference between two entities; at a certain point Stein would even attempt to resolve this tension by claiming that "[i]f the same person does the talking and the listening why so much the better" (<i>LA,</i> 170). Suffice it to say that this tension, as we shall see, would inform and indeed trouble Stein's relationship to "the outside" over the course of the 1930s and 1940s. In <i>Lectures,</i> Stein would acknowledge that it was the task of translating <i>Enfances</i> that first brought home to her the seeming incommensurability of "genius" and "the outside." For the act of translating seemed to suck the life out of "genius" in both its senses: not only was the translator herself considered to be a derivative form of the original genius-author, adopting what translation theorist Lawrence Venuti describes as a "weird self-annihilation" by erasing from her own text any discursive peculiarities in order to render the original into another form of itself.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Moreover, in the act of translation there seemed to be no possibility to engage in the textual process of "talking and listening": what mattered most is that a translation "never call attention to itself."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In a series of retrospective comments on the Hugnet project, Stein sets up an opposition between "dead" translation and living "vibration" in writing, using this also as an occasion to reflect upon the difference between Shakespeare's plays and his sonnets. Shakespeare's plays achieve the textual relationality that Stein calls "genius": "In the plays [words] make the lively sound and if they mean what they said they mean it because a lively sound can as it will or if it does mean what is said" (<i>FA,</i> 135). The plays liberate and enliven the sign, creating unexpected and surprising connections between signs and between signifiers and signifieds. Meaning emerges potentially ("as it will") or not at all ("or if it does"); what matters is textual "liveliness." Stein calls this "writing as it is being written." In comparison, Stein writes, "[t]he words in the sonnets come out with a smooth feeling with no vibration in them such as the words in all his plays have as they come out from them" (<i>N,</i> 52). The sonnets represent "what some one told him to do"; they show an awareness of an outside audience, but do not achieve a genial relationality with this audience. Stein calls this "writing as it has been written," emphasizing derivation and mimicry; this, she writes, is the kind of lifeless writing that is expected from translation. Like Shakespeare's sonnets, a translation "recreate[s] the point of view of somebody else";<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  the translated signs thereby lose their "vibration," and the work that repeats or rerenders these signs in a new language is "dead." What kills the translated text in particular, Stein writes, are the relentless pressures of an "outside," an audience, demanding that the writer write not "his way" but "some way of somebody's" (<i>FA,</i> 130). The dialogic emphasis of what Stein calls "genius" is given over, in the act of translation, to what Georges Hugnet himself would claim the "prior right" of the original author. Such a claim would prove deeply disturbing to Stein, not only because it would preclude the possibility of "talking and listening" but because it would remind her that her own "prior right" had been eclipsed. Again, there is a profound tension in Stein's attitude to the Hugnet project, as in her theory of "genius," between a professed commitment to an antiessentialist textual dialogism and her essentialist need to write "[her] way" rather than "some way of somebody's." Despite her idealization of "talking and listening" as a privileged mode of textual engagement, Stein remained troubled by any situation that turned her into a "listener" rather than a "talker," a scribe rather than an innovator. The Hugnet project threatened both of these senses of "genius." Stein's response to this threat was to "translate" <i>Enfances</i> by altering the essential terms of translation itself.
</p>

<p>
If what translation lacked was the "vibrating" sense of discovery and possibility found in talking and listening, then Stein approached <i>Enfances</i> with this idea in mind. In her presentation of <i>Enfances'</i>s central theme of sexual discovery and arousal, for example, Stein "listens and talks" to the powerful awakenings of a specifically male sexuality, deftly turning this imagery on its head:

takes the confessional voice of Hugnet's original and fashions a more abstract, more degendered portrait of sexual awakening. No "moist hands" manipulate the poetic "I" in Stein's version; instead, Stein's text res arousal ("a well inside") as the effect of strangely disembodied "hands untied," an effect emphasized by the repetition of the semantically neutral phrase "there is." Although Stein's version could be termed a feminist rewriting of a phallocentric original&#x02014;a claim that makes sense if we consider Stein's substitution of the womblike "well inside" for Hugnet's masculine "sexe"&#x02014;there is also something radically, <i>grammatically</i> open-ended about Stein's "translation," something that precludes reference entirely. Marjorie Perloff describes this and other sections in Stein's <i>Enfances</i> translation as achieving "the dissolution of the coherent 'lyric voice' as controlling presence in the poetic text. . . . Nothing is taken for granted; nothing is quite what it seems to be."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  "Listening" to Hugnet's text and "talking back" to it, Stein creates oblique, metonymic connections between original and copy that obscure authorial intention and unhinge stable referentiality. This is less a translation than a "translation," in the modernist sense: a deconstructive rereading that decenters and puts into play the terms of the original. 
</p>

<p>
Like other of Stein's experimental texts, the <i>Enfances</i> translation appears to exemplify what feminist critics have long praised about Stein's writing: its "dialogic form, in which difference may enter without being relegated to a secondary position or subsumed under an authoritarian identity."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Yet it is telling that Stein also felt her "reflection"<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  of <i>Enfances</i> to be an independent work of original genius; her insistence that she get equal billing on the title page of the printed volume was justified because, she felt, "he had done his and R&#x000E8;had done mine."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Needless to say, Hugnet resisted Stein's request, reasoning that

The choice of terms here is telling. "Collaboration" implies a joint effort, with each side sharing equal responsibility for the final product; it is a term of association between

equals. Hugnet's notion of the translator's task, by comparison, is one of assistance or mediation: the translator midwifes the original text, bringing forth in a new vocabulary and idiom another form of the same, yet maintaining intact the hierarchy of original and translation; the text remains the "sole responsibility" of its original author. Hugnet's fundamental disagreement with Stein over translation in general and over parity on the title page ultimately spelled the end of their friendship. When finally published in <i>Pagany</i> , <i>Enfances</i> and Stein's "translation" of it were presented on opposite pages, with Stein's work bearing the dismissive title "Poem Pritten on the Pfances of Georges Hugnet." She eventually republished her version alone in a Plain Edition volume, appropriately entitled "Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship Faded." For the next decade Stein would limit herself to writing original compositions and meditating on some of the problems first raised by the Hugnet project. Then, around 1941, she suddenly began working on the translation of Philippe P&#x000E9;tain's speeches.

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's refusal to become "invisible" in the Hugnet translation makes her later, slavishly literal translation of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches seem even more anomalous. To be sure, <i>Enfances</i> and P&#x000E9;tain's speeches occupy very different textual registers, aesthetic and political; moreover, the allusive language of Hugnet could be said to require a different kind of translational treatment from the French of P&#x000E9;tain, with its commitment to brevity, clarity, and abbreviation.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In the hands of another translator, such textual and linguistic differences would be significant. Yet one would assume that Stein's lifelong interest in transforming, subverting, and revising language and genre would be operative here as well: that the translation of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches, like the Hugnet translation, would be largely an exercise in what Donald Sutherland calls Stein's "overwhelming rhetorical agility."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  One would imagine that P&#x000E9;tain, like Hugnet, would have stimulated Stein's urge to "talk back" to the authoritative original, deconstructing its claims to mastery while emphasizing her own genial authority. In fact, this agility seems absent from the P&#x000E9;tain translation project: there is no playful questioning of the terms and conditions of public speaking or political rhetoric in these translations. Something appears to have shifted not only in her relationship to the "outside" text but also in her complex sense of "genius" as a guiding aesthetic principle.
</p>

<p>
I would argue that this shift is linked to a crucial development in Stein's career over the course of the 1930s: the emergence of a public audience for her work. With the sudden and overwhelming success of <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> in 1933, Stein not only discovered what she had desired for years&#x02014;"la gloire"&#x02014;but also found herself in a new relationship to what she would increasingly refer to as "something outside me": a large, popular audience, placing new demands on her ability to "talk and listen." It is important to recall that her idea of "genius" was crafted during Stein's many years of relative public marginality; with initially no one, and then only a few select readers willing to read her texts, the notion of "talking and listening" became a 

<b></b>

crucial one to describe both the self-directed monologue of the high modernist writer and the elite process of engagement and transformation between this writer and her devoted coterie. For those who dared be "ostracized . . . with God," as Mina Loy wrote in her self-referential "Apology of Genius," the rewards were evident.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Stein's belief in the necessity that "genius" trump other concerns, as we have seen, informs her refusal to become "invisible" in the Hugnet project as well as her privileging of Shakespeare's plays over his sonnets, since the former appear to be written "his way" rather than "some way of somebody's." At the same time, Stein acknowledged feeling keen envy whenever one of her fellow modernists achieved a measure of popular recognition. With the success of <i>The Autobiography</i> Stein finally got what she thought she wanted: an audience of her American contemporaries, an educated, well-read, mostly middle-class set of readers. Yet this was an audience that preferred its modernism to be "explained" before (or instead of) consuming it, and Stein almost immediately felt the constraints of this necessity. In a series of public presentations about her work that she gave to American audiences during a 1934-35 tour of universities, theaters, and social clubs, published as <i>Lectures in America,</i> Stein performs a delicate tightrope act, presenting her new relationship to "the outside" as both "very interesting" and "quite exciting" <i>and</i> as "queer," "perplexing," and "bothersome" (<i>LA,</i> 205; also <i>N,</i> 51, 53). An outside audience may pave the way to external recognition, bringing fame, riches and public approbation, but also preclude "the recognition of the thing that was to be existing as my writing as it was being written." As she writes about <i>The Autobiography,</i> "When the success began . . . I got lost completely lost."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
How could Stein retain her cherished sense of "genius" without losing this equally desired audience? Initially, as in an early public lecture like "Composition as Explanation" , Stein attempted to blend experimental with "explanatory" techniques, appealing to the audience in much the same spirit with which she approached her more marginal coterie of readers during the first two decades of her writing. In "Composition," Stein employs her signature devices of repetition, the continuous present, and referential ambiguity as a way of getting her audience to listen "actively." She further plays with the genre of "explanation" through an insistent interrogation of the coherent authorial voice, as well as through assertions that parody argumentative logic: "By this I mean all this"; "After all this, there is that."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The deconstructive techniques of "Composition" are also evident, though less insistently, in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> and <i>Lectures in America;</i> in both of these texts from the early to mid-1930s Stein retains certain aspects of textual experimentalism (repetition, referential ambiguity) while also attempting to explain her compositional techniques and principles, and thus draw readers to her other, more "purely" experimental texts. Her 1937 <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> stands as the culmination of this effort, overtly appealing to her audience as a collective group of geniuses by turning Stein's story into the story of "everybody." Yet this text, one of Stein's least experimental, also registers a sense of disillusionment with the idea of audience that speaks to Stein's increasing recognition of her celebrity and its price. An especially poignant and memorable passage in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> describes Stein's arrival in Times Square:

One can already glimpse similar signs of self-alienation in <i>Lectures,</i> when she makes a distinction between the "inside" audience (the genius-writer watching herself write, "at the same time talking and listening") and the "outside" audience (the audience demanding that the writer perform, "listening" but not, in turn, "talking"); one recalls Stein's comment that "if the same person does the talking and the listening why so much the better" (<i>LA,</i> 170). What troubles Stein most is the potentiality of this "outside" audience to pollute the "inside" audience, disrupting the very possibility of "talking and listening" ("hitherto I had always had nothing but what was inside me while I was writing . . . but now I suddenly began, to feel the outside inside and the inside outside") (<i>LA,</i> 205). By turning Gertrude Stein into a celebrity, "the outside" makes Stein an outsider to herself. 
</p>

<p>
The increasingly alienating pressures of this new "outside" on Stein over the course of the 1930s help illuminate the central difference between the Hugnet and the P&#x000E9;tain translation projects: the strong sense one gets from reading the latter of foreboding, unease, even coercion. It is as though an "outside" were watching, controlling, and restricting the writer's movements, policing every word in some monstrous mutation of the audience that proved so "upsetting" to Stein in <i>Lectures</i> and in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>. When in the Hugnet project Stein struggles with the issue of an "outside" (the prior text, <i>Enfances,</i> which the translator is meant passively to mediate, as well as the personal demands of Hugnet himself that the text remain his "prior right") she emerges victorious, producing a narrative that "talks and listens" to the original without being dependent on or derivative of it. The Hugnet project seems to confirm rather than undermine Stein's genius, transforming her from a passive listener (the "invisible translator") into an active talker. Some ten years later, the P&#x000E9;tain translations, by contrast, seem marked by a kind of coerced attention, by a compliance on the level of the sign itself. The English text attempts to render the French original through a one-to-one correspondence between signs. Fidelity to the word trumps any linguistic difference that might emerge from syntax or grammar. If what Stein resisted with <i>Enfances</i> were precisely the demands of "fidelity" to the original, then her absolute fidelity to the words of P&#x000E9;tain seems to undermine the theory of genius&#x02014;of "writing as it is being written"&#x02014;that emerged from the Hugnet project.
</p>

<p>
Nor is there any sense in which the literalism of the P&#x000E9;tain translations is effecting what Walter Benjamin would call a "foreignization" of textual process. In "The Task of the Translator" , Benjamin suggests that only the "literal" translation can capture the "literariness" of the original text, allowing both original and translation to emerge in their distinctiveness: "A real translation is transparent; it does not cover the original, does not black its light, but allows the pure language, as though reinforced by 

<b></b>

its own medium to shine upon the original all the more fully. This may be achieved, above all, by a literal rendering of the syntax which proves words rather than sentences to be the primary element of the translator."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> Benjamin ends with a suggestive comparison: "For if the sentence is the wall before the language of the original, literalness is the arcade."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Arcades, the subject of Benjamin's unfinished magnum opus <i>Passagenwerk</i>, are highly associative: commercial passageways that connect two streets together, arcades embody the "anticipation and imaginative expression of a new world";<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  they are sites of fantasy and possibility that link rather than separate. Although Benjamin also emphasizes the arcade's association with consumption, his reference to the arcade in "The Task of the Translator" is clearly favorable: the arcade, like the literal translation, offers a mode of access to the other (street or language), a means of relation that does not "black" the other (as would a wall or an edifice or a sentence, with its commitment to fixed "meaning") but allows the other to be approached in fragmentary glimpses at the end of a transparent corridor. In linguistic terms, the literal translation enables the original text to be present as both "other" (fragmentary, disjointed, elusive) and as "kin," "so that it gives voice to the <i>intentio</i> of the original not as reproduction but as harmony."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Benjamin's theory of translation here seems particularly appropriate to the exigencies of modernist writing, with its severing of word and reference, its intergeneric and interlinguistic disruptions, and its differential play.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  It is akin to Stein's idea of translation as "reflection," or to Hugnet's reference to translation as "collaboration."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the literalism of the P&#x000E9;tain translations seems to emerge out of a different sort of collaboration: not a dialogue between equals but a collaboration undertaken under coercion, such as that practiced by an occupied country during war (the collaboration "between a boot and a bottom," as Philippe Burrin writes).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Just as the Paris of the arcades, the capital of the nineteenth century, would become a very different city under the Vichy regime&#x02014;something Benjamin's fragmentary and apocalyptic <i>Passagenwerk</i> seems to foreshadow&#x02014;so too do Stein's translations of Philippe P&#x000E9;tain's speeches seem of a different order from her own 1930 translation of <i>Enfances</i>. In fact, the literalism of Stein's P&#x000E9;tain translations is neither foreignizing nor disruptive but extraordinarily <i>submissive:</i> a compositional quality also to be found in other strange texts of Stein's from the period&#x02014;<i>Ida</i> (1937-40), with its aborted prophecies; <i>Mrs. Reynolds</i> (1940-42), with its portrait of perversion and megalomania based on Hitler and Stalin; the eerie play trilogy "In a Garden," "Look and Long," and "Three Sisters Who Are Not Sisters" , where misidentifications lead inevitably to death. These are texts whose thematic exploration of passivity in the face of unexpected and arbitrary violence is echoed in a textual passivity characterized by equivocation, doubt, and obsessional repetition. Stein's compositional submissiveness is especially apparent in the P&#x000E9;tain project. Rather than the expression of a subtle and highly theorized understanding of translation as difference from and reconciliation with the other, the literalism of the P&#x000E9;tain translations seems to emerge from a subject in thrall to the aura of a great man: the savior on a white horse, as Stein describes P&#x000E9;tain in her introduction. Here, as in her infamous 1940 paean to Vichy defeat, "The Winner Loses," as 

<b></b>

well as in her 1942-45 <i>Wars I Have Seen,</i> Stein's pro-P&#x000E9;tainism has a mesmerized and spellbound quality about it. It is as though&#x02014;to invoke Susan Sontag's famous characterization of fascism&#x02014;the subversive writer has become a "fixated" or "fascinated" subject.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Late in the war, in an interview with a local paper, Stein talks about "her hero," about "the importance of his words and the significance of the symbol," setting up P&#x000E9;tain in a relationship of dominance toward a submissive populace.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  As Van Dusen points out, Stein's representation of P&#x000E9;tain in her introduction to the translated speeches is fetishistic, erotically and politically charged with the desire of the defeated for mastery, heroism, and "national redemption" in the wake of the German occupation. The literal adherence to P&#x000E9;tain's words in the translations themselves could be seen as a further expression of this masochistic-fetishistic desire.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting in this respect that Stein had already, in the 1930s, framed the issue of audience in terms of sadomasochism, noting that an audience "destroys the physical something that a writer is while he is writing," (<i>N,</i> 56) and that "Sadism is no connecting link but . . . sadism cannot live alone."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The sadist's gaze renders the "physical something" of the genius "talking and listening" to herself into "nothing," a submissive mouthpiece, passively ventriloquizing the audience's needs without any "connecting link." We are reminded here of the randomness of Stein's choice of speeches to translate, as well as the erasure of any editorial voice in the translations themselves, as though the translator were not a connecting link between two languages but entirely invisible. Still, "sadism cannot live alone," without its masochistic counterpart: hence Stein the translator masochistically "chooses" to submit to P&#x000E9;tain, taking up a contractual role that effectively renders impossible the kind of intertextual dialogue attempted in the Hugnet translation project. The erotics and limits of this choice can be seen again in <i>Lectures in America,</i> when Stein res the act of writing with an audience in mind as "perhaps too exciting." For of crucial importance in this discussion of sadomasochism is the sense that any submission to an audience, to an "outside," also encompasses a loss. Whatever desire Stein might have for fame and celebrity exists irreconciliably with the demands of genius; the audience that she craves, the "outside" that she hopes to please, is the same force that denies the very possibility of "talking and listening" by objectifying, hypostatizing, and hence enslaving the writer.

The juxtaposition of the Hugnet and the P&#x000E9;tain translation projects offers insight into the trajectory of Stein's aesthetic over the course of the 1930s, and helps to explain why the later translation project took the shape it did. Yet we cannot finally discuss the P&#x000E9;tain translation project without attention to Stein's politics and the role they played in its conception. If the 1930s was for Stein marked by a series of shifts&#x02014;from literary experimentalism to audience writing, from marginal expatriate to American icon, from "genius" to "celebrity" &#x02014;it was also marked by an ever-hardening political conservatism. From her dislike of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal to her distrust of the Third Republic in France to her "joking" nomination of Adolf Hitler for 

<b></b>

the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934, Stein throughout the 1930s exhibited an allegiance to the Right that was for some of her friends simply an extension of her lifelong "rentier mentality."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Her support for P&#x000E9;tain would reveal itself most overtly in "The Winner Loses" , where Stein, going beyond the conventional French platitudes about P&#x000E9;tain's Armistice as a force of neutrality and healing, praises the hero of Verdun for compelling the citizenry to abandon "the weak vices that they were all indulging in."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Three years earlier, in her correspondence of 1937, she was stating that a dictatorship was "natural": "the majority does want a dictator, it is natural that a majority if it has come to be made up of enormous numbers do, a big mass likes to be shoved as a whole because it feels it moves and they cannot possibly feel that they move themselves as little masses can, there you are, like it or not."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  From this it seems a minor step to describe P&#x000E9;tain, as she does in the introduction to his speeches, as having "achieved a miracle" with the Armistice.
</p>

<p>
Such comments were not unusual for their day: the idea of "big masses" as a "mobocracy"&#x02014;self-deluded and easily manipulable by elites&#x02014;resonates with a long tradition of nineteenth- and twentieth-century critique from Gustave Le Bon to Vilfredo Pareto to Hitler himself. Indeed, Stein's effort in 1937 to undercut liberal democratic and populist platitudes about majority rule does not differ radically from certain passages in <i>Mein Kampf</i>. At the very least, and seen in light of the rest of Stein's "political" pronouncements from the 1930s, her thoughts on the masses appear inseparable from a deep-seated recognition of the power and, arguably, the rightness of authoritarian leadership. This, too, could be seen as in part an outgrowth of her experience as a celebrity over the course of the 1930s. However self-alienating celebrity may have been for Stein in a creative sense, it also seemed to convince her of the power of her authorial voice within the context of a public. "In America everybody is [a celebrity] but some are more than others. I was more than others," Stein announces in <i>Everybody's Autobiography,</i> a text that both affirms and questions her difference from "everybody."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  It is everybody who "makes" a celebrity&#x02014;bringing "the outside inside and the inside outside"&#x02014;but once made, it is the celebrity who, like the genius, guides, instructs, and in turn "saves" everybody. So with P&#x000E9;tain at the Armistice: "And so we in France having seen France governed . . . I must say little by little the most critical and the most violent of us have come gradually to do what the Mar&#x000E9;chal asks all french people to do, to have faith in him and in the fact that France will live."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Although Stein consistently renders P&#x000E9;tain's authoritarian regime as both preordained and unquestioned, there were important if subtle differences in the ways people responded to Vichy&#x02014;from conditional cooperation to <i>attentiste</i> accommodation to outright collaboration.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In fact Stein's willingness to lend textual support to P&#x000E9;tain when many other writers in France at the time were choosing simply to be silent throws her actions into stark relief. Her decision to promote P&#x000E9;tain's speeches to a presumably hostile American audience also represents a degree of ideological commitment to authoritarian rule that seems na&#x000EF;ve or blind at best, pernicious at worst. As Alice Kaplan has written of the French writer and collaborator Robert Brasillach, "Language is at stake . . . the capacity of language to do real evil."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Promoting P&#x000E9;tain's 

<b></b>

language in the translation project, Stein is also by definition promoting the consequences of this language "to do real evil" in the lives of many who experienced the effects of P&#x000E9;tain's decrees. This is by no means a neutral point, especially for interpreters of Stein's writing who attempt to suture it to a progressive politics. Many Stein critics, myself included, have stressed the capacity of her language to do real <i>good</i> as it dismantles traditional (authoritarian and/or patriarchal) structures of syntax and meaning. Stein herself, of course, furthered this assessment in her own analytical statements about "twentieth-century writing" (in <i>Lectures in America</i>), as in her core aesthetic principle of "talking and listening" as a mode of dialogic, non-hierarchical textual engagement. Yet the convergence of Stein's commitment to an oppositional or liberatory poetics with her allegiance to a politics of illiberal reaction represents yet another variation on an increasingly familiar story in modernist studies. Like Pound, Lewis, Yeats, and many other writers of her day, Stein arguably saw in dictatorial authoritarianism and its fascist permutations both aesthetic promise and a necessary "correction" of perceived social ills.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  What remains difficult about Stein's case is the fact that P&#x000E9;tain's corrective course was directed, in the name of an integral France, against individuals like herself: Jews, "foreigners," homosexuals. However much Stein may have seen herself as an exception&#x02014;and here again her sense of herself as a genius may have trumped other identifications&#x02014;it seems remarkable that she would overtly, deliberately, seemingly voluntarily promote a language, and a politics, that would "do real evil" in the lives of fellow Jews, foreigners, and homosexuals.
</p>

<p>
As I have suggested in this essay, however, a close reading of the P&#x000E9;tain translations that focuses upon their rigid literalism highlights Stein's grudging rather than fervent commitment to the Vichy program (the hyperbolic writings of Kaplan's Brasillach provide an instructive contrast with Stein in this instance). As with Stein's other writings of the World War II period, the P&#x000E9;tain translations display on their very surface the marks of reluctance and uncertainty. If, indeed, Stein is to be deemed a "collaborator," it is equally important to acknowledge her probable awareness of the price to be paid for "listening" to the other without talking back, for submitting to the Vichy regime without challenging its "prior right." Such an awareness, as we have seen, pervades the earlier Hugnet project. Having chosen to collaborate through translating P&#x000E9;tain's speeches, Stein seems to encrypt her translations themselves with the deadening implications of this "choice." Their distance from the deconstructive, playful textuality of the Hugnet "translations" is telling, suggesting that a textual compromise has been struggled with and masochistically yielded to, rather than resolved.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the P&#x000E9;tain translations present a writer pulled apart by warring forces. Stein's politics and her fetishization of P&#x000E9;tain make her willing to "submit" to his discourse in a way that seems antithetical to her sense of herself as a genius, as well as to her dialogic principle of talking and listening. Yet Stein had already shown herself to be seduced by the sadism of "the outside" several years before the P&#x000E9;tain project, in <i>Lectures in America</i> and <i>Everybody's Autobiography;</i> the P&#x000E9;tain translations suggest a heightened level of attentiveness to this outside, as though the whole generative tension of the 1930s between the writer and her audience had culminated in a discourse 

<b></b>

that for the first time in Stein's career might justifiably be called "automatic writing." The ethics of Stein's support for Vichy is ultimately inseparable from this masochism toward the discourse of the other. It is as though, faced for the first time in her life with a charged context in which language can truly do evil or do good, Stein passively delivered her authority, and her voice, to "the outside."
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, another more obvious twist to Stein's collaborative activities, as to the form in which the P&#x000E9;tain translations appear. For in the game of inside/outside, everything depends upon perspective. What Stein may have perceived as "the outside" never saw itself as an outside: P&#x000E9;tain and his Vichyites were consummate <i>insiders</i>&#x02014;politically, ideologically, and&#x02014;the fiction of the Unoccupied Zone notwithstanding&#x02014;geographically within the borders of the Nazi regime. The real outsiders for Vichy, again, were the scapegoats who represented all that France was not: in particular, the objectified, hypostatized, essentialized "Jew" whose "type" was now hypervisible to the culture at large. It was, after all, P&#x000E9;tain's infamous decree of October 3, 1940 (the first "Statut des Juifs") that for the first time in French history defined "the Jew" as a discrete legal entity who could be barred from occupying public and professional posts.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  As Michael Curtis reveals, this decree became the model for subsequent German anti-Semitic legislation in France: remarkably, "not only can Vichy claim priority in formulating a definition [of 'the Jew'], but also its formula was more extreme and harsher than the German."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The 1940 Vichy Statut, overtly discussed in the speech of October 9 that Stein translated, foreshadows the moment in 1942, while Stein was still hard at work on her translations, at which the "foreign Jew" in particular would be scapegoated in France.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Political and aesthetic questions aside, was being interpellated as a "Jew" the central factor behind Stein's decision to take on the P&#x000E9;tain translation project?
</p>

<p>
As a "Jew" Stein was clearly vulnerable in a way that other supporters of P&#x000E9;tain were not. Like the French Jewish intellectual Emmanuel Berl, who edited two of the very same speeches of P&#x000E9;tain's that Stein subsequently translated (and who coined the famous P&#x000E9;tainist phrase used to bolster French xenophobia, "La terre, elle, ne ment pas" [The earth does not lie]), Stein occupied the position of what Patrick Modiano has called the "good Jew."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  This was a deeply insecure position at best. If, as Michael Marrus and Robert Paxton suggest, Vichy "measured exemptions [for Jews] out with an eyedropper,"<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  there was no guarantee that the celebrated genius Gertrude Stein would be spared. In fact, Stein's ability to survive the war has generally been attributed not to the propaganda she wrote but more to her close friendship with an important Vichy official, Bernard Fa&#x000FF;. Yet as I argue elsewhere, it is clear both from this official's own double-dealing and from the increasingly precarious situation for Jews in France from 1942 on that Stein was by no means immune from persecution.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Even in hindsight, with our continued tendency to make easy and clear-cut distinctions between "collaborators" and "resisters," it is not hard to perceive the delicacy of Stein's situation. "Listening" to P&#x000E9;tain's speeches, recognizing herself as an outsider to her adopted country, to her hero, and to her genius, Stein may well have decided to undertake the P&#x000E9;tain translation project largely as an insurance policy to guarantee her and Toklas's 

<b></b>

survival. And to this extent, Stein's voice in the translations could be seen as that of a petrified subject, of a Scheherazade, writing as literally and hence as faithfully as possible in order to save her own life.

Most Stein biographies make some mention of the P&#x000E9;tain translation project, including Richard Bridgman, <i>Gertrude Stein in Pieces</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970), 317-8, and Linda Wagner-Martin, "<i>Favored Strangers": Gertrude Stein and Her Family</i> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1995), 246-7.

Janet Malcolm's 2003 <i>New Yorker</i> expos&#x000E9;, "Gertrude Stein's War: The Years in Occupied France," has generated a good deal of attention among general readers and scholars, in large part due to its scandalized tone. Touching briefly on Stein's P&#x000E9;tain translation project, Malcolm paints a largely one-sided and unflattering portrait of Stein as a childish, narcissistic, politically na&#x000EF;ve aesthete and "snob." With her reliance on the work of Burns and Dydo for her conclusions, Malcolm adds little that is new to the story of Stein's collaborative activities and of her experience under the Vichy regime.

This is not to deny the degree to which "fascist ideology" in its many forms&#x02014;German, Italian, French&#x02014;framed itself in terms of intellectual and artistic "iconoclasm." In France, for example, fascist intellectuals from both Right and Left explicitly positioned themselves against the "bourgeois decadence" of the Third Republic and argued for a wholesale restructuring of society. Their critiques often mobilized the techniques and representational modes of modernist aesthetics. See Robert Soucy, "Drieu la Rochelle and Modernist Anti-Modernism in French Fascism," <i>MLN</i> 95 : 922-37; also Peter Fritzsche, "Nazi Modern,"  3, no. 1 (January 1996): 1-21. Nevertheless, our contemporary understanding of the high modernist artist as a genius-re far removed from ideological tendencies or constraints seems to preclude the issue of political engagement, despite the well-known fascist leanings of many modernists (including, in the Anglo-American canon alone, Pound, Eliot, Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, and Wyndham Lewis).

See John Whittier-Ferguson, "Stein in Time: History, Manuscripts, and Memory,"  6, no. 1 : 115-51. Whittier-Ferguson challenges Van Dusen's reading of Stein's introduction as straightforwardly P&#x000E9;tainist, citing Stein's "complicated and peculiar" rendering of time and character in this piece, and aligning it politically with the much more critical wartime novel <i>Mrs. Reynolds</i>. Yet one could just as easily link Stein's portrayal in the introduction of Marshal P&#x000E9;tain to her enthusiastic portrayals of generals Ulysses Grant and George Washington in the 1932 text <i>Four in America</i>. Whittier-Ferguson fails to mention that Stein's famous description of P&#x000E9;tain in the introduction&#x02014;"first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen"&#x02014;is taken directly from the "George Washington" chapter of <i>Four in America,</i> which itself borrows verbatim from General Henry Lee's famous <i>Funeral Oration on the Death of George Washington</i> . Far from being a "clich&#x000E9;," as Whittier-Ferguson argues, this phrase has deep historical resonance for Stein, who prided herself on her knowledge of and embeddedness in American history. As the contemporaneous prose text "The Winner Loses, A Picture of Occupied France"  makes clear, Stein indeed felt that P&#x000E9;tain would perform a George Washington-style liberation of the "true" France from its decadent Third Republic foes. Stein, "The Winner Loses, A Picture of Occupied France," in <i>How Writing is Written,</i> vol. 2 of <i>The Previously Uncollected Writings of Gertrude Stein,</i> ed. Robert B. Haas (Los Angeles: Black Sparrow Press, 1974), 113-32.

It is important to note that P&#x000E9;tain often collaborated with others on the composition of his speeches, including Emmanuel Berl, Gaston Bergery, Henri Massis, and Henri du Moulin de Labarth&#x000E8;te. Yet the latter states in <i>Le Temps des illusions&#x02014;Souvenirs, juillet 1940-avril 1942</i> (Gen&#x000E8;ve: A l'enseigne du Cheval Ail&#x000E9;, 1946) that P&#x000E9;tain "retained the final word on the presentation of his text. . . . He pruned, with great cuts of his scissors, pieces and morsels [of text]. Then he repaired them . . . giving to the whole the direct and sober style that was his own. . . . The Mar&#x000E9;chal consecrated excessive time to these messages. He sanded them, corrected them, polished them indefinitely, assuring himself, with the dictionary, of the precise sense of each word" (159-60).

In another modernist gesture, Benjamin insistently moves in this essay toward an "ideal of pure meaning" that lies at the limit of all translations. For more on this aspect of Benjamin's essay, see John Sallis, <i>On Translation</i> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002). Sallis deftly shows how Benjamin's critique of "the classical determination of translation" as "restitution of meaning" reemerges "at the limit, as an ideal . . . a pure language in which there remains only the expressionless word" .

Much, of course, has been written on the convergence of modernist aesthetics and fascist politics. On the particular appeal of French fascism to modernist writers, see two seminal works: Zeev Sternhell, <i>Neither Right Nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986) and David Carroll, <i>French Literary Fascism: Nationalism, Anti-Semitism, and the Ideology of Culture</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995).

The Statut des Juifs of 3 October 1940 defined "Jews" as individuals having three grandparents of the "Jewish race," and established their right or denial of access to certain professions. "Jews" were excluded "from political office, judicial appointments, diplomatic and prefectorial posts, and the senior branches of public services. They could not be officers or heads of enterprises in which the state was involved. They could not be managers or directors in the press, radio, cinema or theater." A second Statut des Juifs of 2 June 1941 further specified the meaning of "race" to assert that "Jews were now those people who, <i>irrespective of religion,</i> had at least three grandparents of Jewish race." Bizarre exceptions were made: for example, "If an individual abandoned the Jewish religion, that person could claim to be non-Jewish if the abandonment occurred before 25 June 1940 and if the person had only two grandparents of 'Jewish race.'" Michael Curtis, <i>Verdict on Vichy</i> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 2002), 112-3.

The "foreign Jew," a much-discussed notion among Vichy administrators, was both a demographic term, referring to the large number of Jewish refugees who entered France beginning in 

<b></b>

1933, and an abstract idea of "undesirability" that was often (although increasingly less so as the war went on) opposed to the "desirable" French-born Jew. Emmanuel Berl, a Jewish supporter of P&#x000E9;tain, worked to underscore this distinction in 1938 when he wrote of "the impossibility for France to let her country and her capital be invaded by the undesirables of every land." Berl quoted in Michael R. Marrus and Robert O. Paxton, <i>Vichy France and the Jews</i> (New York: Basic Books, 1981), 43. While Stein was certainly a foreign Jew, she did not exactly fall into the category as defined by Vichy. Moreover, her visibility as a famous American may have offered her some immunity from persecution, but by all accounts, according to Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, this visibility was not enough to save her life. See Bard, <i>Forgotten Victims: The Abandonment of Americans in Hitler's Camps</i> (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1994). Stein herself notes in <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> that she and Toklas were warned in 1943 by the sous-prefet of the region to flee to Switzerland or risk being put in a concentration camp.

Stein's Vichy protector, Bernard Fa&#x000FF;, had been a member of Stein's circle of young male admirers in the 1920s and was, with Georges Hugnet, Stein's principal French translator, translating sections from <i>The Making of Americans</i> and <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> into French. Unlike Hugnet and many others, however, Fa&#x000FF; never fell out of Stein's favor, and during the 1930s he emerged as a key facilitator for many of Stein's public appearances, including her lecture tour in America. During the war, Fa&#x000FF; was chosen by his close friend Philippe P&#x000E9;tain to become director of the Biblioth&#x000E8;que Nationale; he was also secretly charged with the investigation and deportation of French Freemasons, for which he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1946. Among the charges leveled at Fa&#x000FF; in his 1946 trial were his denunciation of suspected communists and Freemasons on his staff at the Biblioth&#x000E8;que Nationale and the acceptance of a bribe in return for "protection" of a Jewish friend during the early years of the war. His trial transcript also reveals that Fa&#x000FF; was a Gestapo agent. See my essay, "Gertrude Stein, Bernard Fa&#x000FF;, and the Ruthless Flowers of Friendship," in Kirk Curnutt, ed., "<i>Where the Twentieth Century Was": New Essays on Gertrude Stein</i> (forthcoming from University of Wisconsin Press).
