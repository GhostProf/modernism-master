      A surge in interest among modernist scholars in the area of textual editing has made itself evident this past year. Hailed as a “new direction” in modernist studies at the most recent meeting of the Modern Language Association, editing was also the theme of the 2008 International Conference on Virginia Woolf.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The dizzying array of panels devoted to textual editing, electronic editions, and digital archiving at the most recent MLA meeting testifies to a profession-wide interest in the possibilities of digital environments, particularly as economic constraints continue to make academic publishing increasingly inhospitable to expensive editorial undertakings. The proliferation of electronic editions and digital archives, and the attendant theoretical discussion of them, is bringing renewed attention to the largely invisible textual theories and practices that underlie both digital and print editions.
    </p>
<p>
      Post-eclectic print editions of modernist works have been in existence for several decades: Hans Gabler’s 1983 genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, which utilizes a diachronic, synoptic apparatus for the display of textual variants; Valerie Eliot’s documentary edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wasteland</span>, which features photofacsimile reproductions and transcriptions of the holograph and typescript versions of the work; the documentary Cornell Yeats, which similarly includes photofacsimile reproductions and transcriptions of each poem; and an archival edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ezra Pound’s Poetry and Prose: Contributions to Periodicals.</span> Post-eclectic electronic editions of Ezra Pound’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>, the notebooks for James Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegan’s Wake</span>, and Samuel Beckett’s manuscripts are only a few of the many modernist editorial projects presently underway. Merry  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Pawlowski and Vara Neverow’s electronic facsimile edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> reading notes and Julia Briggs’s electronic genetic edition of the “Time Passes” section of <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span> are the first efforts to bring Virginia Woolf’s writing into the electronic realm.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Woolf Online: An Electronic Edition and Commentary of Virginia Woolf’s “Time Passes”</span> is significant not only for the insight it offers into the novel’s rich composition history, but for being the first edition of a work written by Woolf to have been edited according to contemporary textual editing theories and practices.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Virginia Woolf’s works historically have been, and continue to be, edited according to a modernist, essentialist view of textuality that emphasizes the importance of final authorial intention and the production of emended, definitive editions of texts. Established with W. W. Greg’s influential 1950 essay “The Rationale of Copy-Text” and subsequently developed through the work of Thomas Tanselle and Fredson Bowers, this approach is regarded as “modernist” in its view of the work of art as a “well-wrought urn, at once unitary, authoritative, and superior to historical contingency, the product instead of an autonomous creative artist.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> D. C. Greetham identifies both as “exemplary modernist practices” in their “organicist, artefactual view of literature and a single unitary consciousness” in which the work of art “is perceived in spatial terms of closure and completion rather than postmodernist open-ended fragmentation.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The temporary lifting of copyright on Woolf’s writings in 1992 produced a spate of new eclectic editions of Woolf’s works by Hogarth, Blackwell, Penguin, and World’s Classics<span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> one of which (Hogarth) identified its edition as “definitive” and another (Blackwell) as “authoritative.” These editions consistently privilege the production of clear reading texts derived, with very few exceptions, from the first British editions of Woolf’s works, which are generally regarded as possessing the greatest textual authority. The rationale of one series editor, who selected the British first edition as copy-text as “a practical way of shedding the accumulated errors of later editions,” exemplifies a common practice central to the eclectic approach to textual editing: what Gerald Grigely has called “textual eugenics,” the impulse to “purify” the text by stripping it of its corruptions.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Elsewhere, she distinguishes between “good” and “bad” reprint series, identifying the former as “a carefully edited text with a helpful introduction and notes” and the latter as one that “reproduces a corrupt, much reprinted text with no supporting material at all”: a dialectic implicit in Naomi Black’s reference to her edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> for Blackwell as “a ‘good’ text, one that is properly edited, annotated, and placed in context.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Briggs attributed the fact that few “serious attempts to edit Woolf’s individual texts according to contemporary scholarly practice” had been made prior to 1992 to the fact that insufficient training in theories and practices of textual editing had rendered her early editors “hardly equal to the task of formulating appropriate textual policies, far less of implementing them” (“BT,” 147). Hans Gabler similarly observed how
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	Unlike Eliot’s, Virginia Woolf’s writings have received a variegated range of editorial activity, marked at the same time, however, by lack of coordination, uncertain or absent principles, lack of methodological awareness and mutual incomprehension among the several concurrent editorial enterprises. . . . The transcripts of Woolf’s manuscripts that have been made available reflect little or no concerted thinking as to the nature of transcriptions.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      He went on to conclude in the year 2006 that the task of “<span style="font-style:italic;">editing Virginia Woolf</span> quite simply still remains to be undertaken”—and that “it is not merely the editing, but also the thinking about editing Woolf that needs to be undertaken from scratch.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
      That no transcription or edition of the holograph and typescript fragments of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> or its sister text, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, has been published more than thirty years after the feminist recuperation of Woolf began—and in light of the fact that holograph drafts and/or transcriptions of those drafts have been published for each of her other major works—is surprising given feminists’ early attention to the holograph drafts of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, which were instrumental in bringing to light Woolf’s proclivity toward self-censorship.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The discrepancy between the pre-publication and published versions of her works is particularly marked in her work of the thirties, the decade in which she was engaged in her most forceful critique of militarist, capitalist, fascist, patriarchal, and imperialist ideologies. While self-censorship can be seen in earlier works such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One’s Own</span>, it is particularly pronounced in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, the companion-text and fictional counterpart of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span><a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> The 900 page holograph draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span> reveals the development of Woolf’s feminist pacifist critique of war and the fictional origins of her re of the Outsider. Comparing the holograph draft with the 420 page published version, Grace Radin concludes that the holograph suggests “an explicitly political novel” that differs greatly from the final product: absent is Woolf’s “radical and explicit ‘outsider’s’ denunciation of a male-dominated, imperialistic, war-mongering and class-ridden society.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
      A resurgent interest in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> as Woolf’s most overtly political works makes the absence of published holograph facsimiles and transcriptions all the more unfortunate. The current state of affairs can be explained in part by the longstanding bias among critics and publishers for Woolf’s fiction—and quite specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> the vitriolic <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>—and in part by the sheer extensiveness of the holograph documents, in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, and the complex, fragmented nature of those that exist in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span><a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Complete transcriptions of the holographs drafts and fragments are essential for fostering deeper insight into the origins of these, her two most politically ambitious works. But editorial attention to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> must extend beyond simply reproducing and transcribing holograph fragments if the proposed edition is to suggest something beyond the synchronous dimension of an individual textual state and something of the social and cultural context in which it was conceived, composed, published, and transmitted.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The gradual supplanting of the modernist, eclectic approach to textual editing by a postmodernist approach that celebrates textual fluidity, along with a more expansive notion of textuality, offers rich possibilities for a future edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that capable of displaying that work’s extensive pre-publication fragments.
    </p>
<p>
      Several shifts have taken hold within textual editing during the past twenty-five years that have helped to destabilize the hegemony of eclecticism in Anglo-American editing: the rise of social textual criticism, introduced in the early 1980s with Jerome McGann’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism</span> and D. F. McKenzie’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts</span>; the widespread implementation of textual versioning in modern editions such as the Cornell Wordsworth and the Cornell Yeats; and the westward migration  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of Continental genetic editing theory and practice, made palpable by Hans Gabler’s 1983 synoptic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses.</span><a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Over the last quarter century, the general direction of textual editing has been away from modernist, eclectic editions that offer emended, clear reading texts, and toward postmodernist editions that showcase the instability and plurality of a given work as witnessed in its multiple textual states. An important part of this shift was the historicizing of the literary work advocated by Jerome McGann, whose seminal work destabilized the notion of “final authorial intention” by redefining the authoritative text as “always one that has been socially produced” and the central practice of literary criticism as “a complex structure of analysis which considers the history of the text in relation to the related histories of its production, reproduction, and reception” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CMTC,</span> 75, 123). While the practice of versioning predates McGann’s work by nearly four centuries, his redefinition of the literary work as composed of “a series of specific ‘texts’” was instrumental in theorizing a “versionist” sense of textuality that located the existence of the literary work “not in any one version, but in all the versions put together.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
      With its ability to accommodate multiple versions of a work and highlight variation among those versions, the post-eclectic approach to textual editing is particularly suitable for the editing of modernist works for which extensive pre-publication documents exist. Ultimately, the modernist and postmodernist approaches to textual editing are diametrically opposed in their methods of handling textual variants: while the modernist, intentionalist approach to textual editing emphasize a separation of text and apparatus that subordinates the latter in favor of a clear reading text, the post-eclectic, postmodernist approach to textual editing refuses this distinction, preferring textual open-endedness to closure and the display of variants to their concealment. In this way, “variance becomes not a quality to be subsumed in the ideal . . . but, on the contrary, the innate condition of textuality and of the editing that reflects this condition.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Post-eclectic textual editions concern themselves primarily with the display of versions and variants, calling attention to “the tension existing between differentiated states. . . . at what occurs in the transition between texts and how our critical locus may not be on one text or another text, but at the point of transition between those texts” (<span style="font-style:italic;">TA,</span> 48, 49).

<p>
	The questions of precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">what</span> may be said to constitute a version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> and precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">where</span> the boundaries of the work are situated are contentious at best. In light of the work’s complex composition history spanning eight years, and Woolf’s proclivity toward self-censorship, feminist scholars generally agree that the boundaries of the work extend beyond its several published versions to include pre-publication materials.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Thus, the editor of the Shakespeare Head edition of the work, Naomi Black, identifies five versions of the work in addition to the first British and American editions, including Woolf’s manuscript notes for the speech she gave to the London National Society for Women’s Service in 193l; her typescript of that speech; the published  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> version of that speech, “Professions for Women” ; the interchapters of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pargiters</span>; and the two-part essay “Women Must Weep—Or Unite Against War,” published in the May–June 1938 <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly.</span><a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Black’s decision to restrict herself to only those versions that have appeared in print allows her to circumvent the difficult question of how to view the holograph and typescript fragments of that work. Moreover, her assumption that the work’s boundaries are coterminous with its publication, rather than extending beyond the moment of publication, allows her also to circumvent the question of whether subsequent texts that extend the logic and analysis of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> might also be regarded as versions of that work. Jane Marcus, for example, adopts a more expansive view of versioning that includes pre-publication documents such as reading notes and scrapbooks; excised passages, including the interchapters of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pargiters</span> and unpublished portions of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>; and works both previous and subsequent to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that are thematically linked to it, including “A Society,” <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One’s Own</span>, and the introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Life As We Have Known It</span>.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Anna Snaith likewise suggests that the correspondence received, and in many cases responded to, by Woolf following the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>—correspondence that helped her extend the argument of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> in later essays like “Why?,” “Reviewing,” and “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid”—should be considered an “extension of the text” itself, as “part of the huge body of evidence for the links between patriarchy, war and fascism, the links between public and private tyrannies.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Provided that one conceives the boundaries of the work to be sufficiently broad on both ends, one might also reasonably add to these her little-known essay, “The Plumage Bill” , “Two Women: Emily Davies and Lady Augusta Stanley” , <span style="font-style:italic;">Flush</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> “Reviewing” , “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid” , and “Why?” , all of which share thematic and rhetorical similarities with <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span> Such an expansive view of textual boundaries is consistent with postmodernist notions of textuality and intertextuality, in which “the materials of which the peaks of ‘finished’ literary works are composed are seen to be interlinked, symbiotic, and in continuous, interrelated flux” and in which “relationships within and between the author’s writings form, as it were, an <span style="font-style:italic;">authorial</span> intertextuality, a continuum of authorship.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Various schools of thought exist as to what constitutes a version of a literary work, with debate generally centering on whether a version ought to be determined by the number of variants or by the textual significance of those variants, whether versions need have a material basis, and whether versions must be authorial. On the one hand is the geneticists’ view that a version is “constituted by a single variant” and forms a discrete semiotic system comprised of interlocking linguistic parts that exist only in relation to one another.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> A common objection to the structuralist view is that it fails to impose any qualitative criteria and therefore produces versions that are otherwise insignificant. Other textual theorists like Peter Shillingsburg, Thomas Tanselle, Siegfried Scheibe, and John Bryant have attempted to establish qualitative, content-based criteria by which to base their determinations.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In attempting to define what is understood as a “distinctive phase of creation,” Bryant finds useful Scheibe’s concept of revisions that function as “turning points” in the overall development of the work, those “decisive  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> change[s]” that occur early in the work’s composition, as opposed to the changes made later on in the revision process that “that tend to involve fine-tunings of already conceived texts.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> He also finds helpful Tanselle’s distinction between “vertical revisions” that transform the work substantively and “horizontal revisions” that “refine the expression of a passage without changing the drift or general effect of the whole” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span> 85). Content, rhetorical function, and authorial intention intersect, however, in the criteria that he ultimately adopts: versions must display “a <span style="font-style:italic;">strategic</span> pattern of revision evincing some <span style="font-style:italic;">reconception of the function of the work itself</span>” that evidences an author’s “attempt to manipulate a readership differently.” As a result, each version can be seen to possess a “definable <span style="font-style:italic;">rhetorical impact</span>” that “necessarily alter[s] our reading of a work” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 90; italics in original).
      </p>
<p>
	A second debate concerns whether a version need have a material basis. The materialist position, adopted by social text theorists Jerome McGann, D. F. McKenzie, and Jack Stillinger, identifies a version with its physical documents. This view is implicit in Donald Reiman’s position that “if holograph mss or authoritative transcriptions of the work survive in sufficiently distinctive states, they themselves ought to be published as versions.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Tanselle, Shillingsburg, and Bryant, on the other hand, argue that versions need not exist in physical form, but can include mental or conceptual states that lead to the development of the work. Equating the version with “the conception or aim of the Work at a point of Utterance,” Shillingsburg distinguishes among potential, developing, and essayed versions: while often physically unrecoverable, a potential version “refers to the abstract incipient ideas about the Work as it grows in the consciousness of the author” and may include “abstract conceptual concepts in the mind of an author” as well as notes or preliminary drafts, while developing versions are said to consist of “trial drafts in some material form” and essayed versions of “completed manuscripts or revised texts.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Potential versions may also include what Bryant refers to as “inferred versions,” which “can only be speculated upon and constructed out of partial evidence found in the document” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 79). Bryant distinguishes between three kinds of versions, each corresponding with a particular stage of textual production, which he classifies as the creation, publication, and adaptation stages. Versions at the creation stage, he argues, may include ideas expressed in journals and letters that reveal the evolution of the work’s concept, various forms of “scribbling” including notes and prewriting, as well as working drafts, circulating drafts, fair copies, and typescripts (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 90–1). Versions at the publication level may include those “physical documents emerging from the first phases of print reproduction—copy-editing, galleys, and page proofs; magazine issues, first editions, and corrected copies of editions,” while those at the adaptation level may include translations, productions, films, and other forms of non-authorial adaptation made after the publication of a work (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 92, 93).
      </p>
<p>
	According to these expansive theories, a future editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> would possess the authority to include as versions of the work “abstract conceptual concepts” expressed in her diaries and letters; various forms of “scribbling,” including her reading notes, preliminary forms of writing, and early drafts; and physically nonexistent versions that can be inferred from authorial corrections. Even the three volumes of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> scrapbooks would have authority as a version under the conceptual view of textuality, as their contents may be said to infer the overall development of the work. (One might even argue that each item contained in the scrapbooks ought to be regarded as a version under the terms established by Shillingsburg and Bryant.) Letters received in response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that suggest an ongoing conversation between Woolf and her correspondent would be authorized by Bryant as belated evidence of Woolf’s “concept” of the work, and as readerly “remakings” of the work through the processes of reading and interpretation. An edition that is to incorporate each of Woolf’s innumerable references to the project in her diaries and letters over the course of a decade, each individual reading note collected in her twelve volumes related to the project, each item collected in her three volumes of scrapbooks, each distinctive holograph and typescript version of each of the several works thematically related to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, each published version of the work, each imprint of each published version of the work (as Briggs would have us include), and each cultural appropriation, adaptation, or “textual remaking” that occurs over the course of the text’s lifetime (as Bryant would have us include, thereby constantly expanding the size of the edition)—an edition that is to incorporate all of these documents seems impossible to accommodate in anything <span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> than an electronic edition. Accordingly, each model discussed below lends itself easily to implementation in a digital environment, as can be seen in John Bryant’s electronic fluid-text edition of Herman Melville’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Typee</span>, Julia Briggs’s electronic genetic edition of Virginia Woolf’s “Time Passes,” and Bruce Graver’s and Ron Tetreault’s electronic edition of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Lyrical Ballads</span>, which allows for parallel text comparison.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In what follows, I explore the viability of the parallel text edition, the genetic edition, and the fluid-text edition as possible models for a new post-eclectic edition of this work. Although my essay will focus on the application of these editorial models to a specific work, the ensuing discussion of theoretical issues and practical applications may be useful to scholars imagining future editions of other works for which extensive pre-publication materials exist.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Notes toward a Parallel Text Edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>
</h1>
<p>
	It is widely recognized that a considerable degree of variation exists between British and American first editions of Woolf’s works. “Extensive and substantial” textual differences are particularly marked among her mid-career writings, although they can also be found in later works, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> (“BT,” 151). Brenda Silver and Julia Briggs attribute this textual phenomenon to Woolf’s practice of marking up British and American proofs separate from one another, which allowed her to “knowingly send out different versions, different texts” (“TC,” 196) and thereby to create “two distinct lines of textual transmission” (“BT,” 152).<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>
	At least three distinct versions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> appeared within Woolf’s lifetime: a significantly different, shorter version published as “Women Must Weep—Or Unite Against War” in the May and June 1938 issues of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>; a British edition,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> published by the Hogarth Press on 2 June 1938; and an American edition, published by Harcourt Brace on 25 August 1938. The likelihood that a fourth version of the work appeared during Woolf’s lifetime has gone unmentioned in any account of the work’s publication history, and is likewise absent from B. J. Kirkpatrick’s bibliography. Nevertheless, a letter dated 24 September 1938 in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> letter file, transcribed and published by Anna Snaith, reveals that Woolf had agreed to allow extracts of the work to be published by the Married Women’s Association, a British organization that advocated for the economic and political interests of married women.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The most recent edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> to include a list of textual variants, the Shakespeare Head edition, identifies 34 variations in wording between the British and American first editions and the existence of four passages that appear only in the endnotes to the American edition. Given that these results have been produced through computer collation, which has been shown to be demonstrably inaccurate in regard to Woolf’s other works, one must assume that this represents the <span style="font-style:italic;">minimum</span> number of textual differences that can be said to exist.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	A future editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> might wish to take on interversional variation as a focal point for a post-eclectic edition of the work. The edition that seems most appropriate for displaying variation among published versions of this work is the parallel text edition. Rather than tracing the genesis of the work through its various pre-publication documents (as in a genetic edition), or highlighting the significance of revision in the evolution of the work (as in a fluid-text edition), the parallel text edition would highlight and display difference through the use of a facing-page display. While the more localized, condensed forms of variation that one finds in the British and American first editions could be quite easily displayed using marginal notes or footnotes within a variorum edition, the more extensive, substantive differences between “Women Must Weep” and the first American edition would be better accommodated within the format of a parallel text edition.

	This choice of texts and edition recommends itself on multiple counts. On a practical level, it would make immediately available to a new generation of readers a text that has not been reproduced since its initial appearance in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, done so in a format designed to display its differences from the versions with which they are already familiar. Given that parallel text editions can foreground historical and social theories of text production in trying to “plausibly explain the state of difference” between two texts, this choice of edition would generate questions of the ultimate importance to their study: whether the variation is understood to be a product of political, social, cultural, bibliographic, or personal pressures, or some combination thereof, a socialized view of these texts divests the author of sole authority over her work, and promulgates a view of textual authority as that which is located in a “social nexus.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The textual passages that I have chosen to represent in parallel text format [<a name="1a-text" href="#1a"><span style="font-style:italic;"> 1</span></a>] on the following pages reveal distinct differences from one another. Both passages begin with the speaker’s description of the re of the Dictator in the photograph at which both reader and speaker are presumably looking. From this moment of shared similarity, the passages diverge: in “Women Must Weep,” the photograph “imposes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> itself” upon the letter, as if materializing from nothing, while in the first American (and British) editions, the speaker actively “lays” it before the reader: a textual change that ascribes to the speaker a greater degree of agency. As a result of this simple change, the speaker in “Women Must Weep” immediately moves on to an exposition of the differences that inhere in acts of looking, admitting that “many men of highest edition” hold favorable views of war and fascism. Recognizing the ultimate relativity of what constitutes good and evil, the speaker’s emphasis on alternative ways of viewing the world makes the predominant characteristic of the passage one of humility, and its predominant function the modeling of tolerant attitudes toward the “Other.” The passage, moreover, possesses a rhetorical function distinct from the other, as a way of justifying the existence of the Society of Outsiders. Given that “there is no judge; there is no certainty in heaven above or on earth below,” the speaker maintains that ethical determinations are to be made on an individual basis as a result of the processes of dispassionate reasoning, self-examination, and cultural awareness: presented as the outcome of such processes, the “rules” proposed by the Society of Outsiders are subject to instant validation.
      </p>
<p>
	If the previous passage is driven primarily by the speaker’s exposition of the differences in viewing the photograph, the second passage is driven primarily by an exposition of the speaker’s motives for presenting the photograph and contains several additional passages that dramatically alter the content, tone, and rhetorical function of the passage as a whole. By changing the circumstances in which the photograph makes its appearance in the text, Woolf gives her speaker the opportunity to finalize the connection between the “tyrannies and servilities” of the public and private spheres, as realized in the re of the Dictator. The speaker articulates as a second motive the desire to promote a greater self-awareness of the ways in which “we are ourselves that re,” thus destabilizing the Self/Other binary that is ultimately responsible for war. Moving beyond the “good” and “evil” dichotomy of the “Women Must Weep” passage, the photograph of the Dictator is invested with the ability to signify our connectedness as human beings:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  But the human re even in a photograph suggests other and more complex emotions. It suggests that we cannot dissociate ourselves from that re but are ourselves that re. It suggests that we are not passive spectators doomed to unresisting obedience but by our thoughts and actions can ourselves change that re. A common interest unites us; it is one world, one life.
	</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	This vision “of a unity that rubs out divisions as if they were chalk marks only,” of “the capacity of the human spirit to overflow boundaries and make unity out of multiplicity,” is without question Woolf’s most optimistic and poetic meditation on the possibility of peace, and her most extensive articulation of how such a state of peace might be achieved through the dismantling of the Self/Other binary.
      </p>
<p>
	Given that both passages appear near the end of their respective versions, it seems reasonable to assume that variation in each passage suggests some shifting intention on Woolf’s part as to how to end each text. The variations discussed thus far suggest that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	by emphasizing interpersonal difference, Woolf may have wished only to validate the fruits of her own intellectual labour, the Society of Outsiders, as an example of the kind of efforts that must be exerted to determine one’s own ethical stance. Her emphasis on unity, and her active de-emphasis of difference in the second version of the above passage—in which the entire passage is reduced to the introductory clause, “Whatever the verdict of others may be upon the man in uniform—and opinions differ”—suggests that by the time she was writing this version, she perhaps felt less need to defend or justify the Society, and more need to provide some cause for optimism, some vision of unity in a world becoming increasingly characterized by disunity.

	The facing-page display of the parallel text edition allows the reader to reconstruct the possible direction of the textual revisions that he or she sees. Placing the two works alongside one another challenges a critical assumption held by many Woolf scholars: that is, that “Women Must Weep” is, in fact, an abridged version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span><a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Little is known about the composition of the shorter work, other than that Woolf was correcting the proofs for it at roughly the same time that she was correcting the proofs for both editions of the book. Were “Women Must Weep” an abridgement of the first edition, one would expect to find the same content in both versions, expressed in condensed form in “Women Must Weep.” Yet, strangely what one discovers in this instance is the reverse: a passage in the first American edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that looks like a condensed version of one that appears in “Women Must Weep.” The multi-directional style of reading facilitated by the facing-page display suggests the distinct possibility that “Women Must Weep” may be an earlier rather than later abridged version of the British and American first editions. In addition to encouraging readers to engage in close textual reading to determine the extent of variation and to determine how linguistic variation is connected to matters of tone and voice, a parallel text edition of “Women Must Weep” would engage readers in considering how and why that work employs a rhetorical strategy different from the first American edition, and in determining how much, and why, the content varies as it does within both American versions. Users of this edition would be able to examine local variation as a means of determining more definitively the relation of these versioned parts to the textual whole.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Notes toward a Genetic Edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>
</h1>
<p>
	A genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> recommends itself for its superior ability to display the work’s progress through its multiple pre-publication stages; by synthesizing inter- and intraversional variation in its textual display, a genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> would allow readers to trace the evolution of specific passages through various sequences of composition and revision. A synoptic apparatus, similar to that adopted by Hans Gabler in his genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, seems particularly well suited for displaying the numerous holograph and typescript fragments that have survived in relation to the work. By placing variant readings in close proximity to one another, a synoptic display of pre-publication documents would allow readers both to trace the sequential  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> development of a specific line or short passage, and thus to attend to the diachronous dimension of the work, and to reconstruct a particular level of the work, and thus to attend to its synchronous dimensions. Placing the synoptic text opposite a reading text based on the first American edition of the work would allow further comparison between pre-publication states and the work in its most expansive published state.
      </p>
<p>
	A synoptic display of pre-publication materials relating to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> would need to limit itself to those documents bearing a distinct linguistic relationship to published versions of the work. While textual theory would allow us to admit as “versions” of the work <span style="font-style:italic;">avant-textes</span> with no direct linguistic correlation to the published version (including reading notes, excerpts of letters and diaries that reveal the conceptual nature of the work, scrapbooks, etc.), accommodating these materials within the constraints of the synoptic apparatus would be practically impossible. In a print edition, these paratextual materials could be included in an appendix constructed as a reading text in its own right, with its own set of textual notes referring the reader back to those places in the synoptic or reading text in which Woolf made use of the materials and notes that she had gathered. An editor’s notes would allow the reader to move easily from the reading or synoptic text to the appendix, and from the appendix to the reading or synoptic text, facilitating multi-directional reading and allowing the reader to trace the work’s genesis forward from its moments of inception, or backward from its moments of inscription.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The synoptic text in this genetic edition would incorporate the approximately 291 pages of holograph and typescript fragments that are housed in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library and in the Monks House Papers at the University of Sussex. There is some speculation, however, as to the existence of another manuscript apart from the fragments housed in these collections. The document at the center of this controversy is the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that Woolf reported having donated to the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom at the request of May Sarton in February 1939.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> The circumstances surrounding the document are as follows. In a letter dated 15 January 1939, May Sarton requested that Woolf donate a manuscript for an upcoming auction to benefit the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom, the American sister organization of the German Academy of Arts and Sciences in Exile.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> “In New York an association for taking care of refugees from Germany has been having auctions of mss.,” Sarton wrote. “Prince Lowenstein asked me to see if I could persuade Julian [Huxley], H. G. [Wells] and you to part with a written fragment of yourself for this purpose. It seems rather horrible, but also necessary as anything that <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> be done <span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> be done for these people.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Woolf responded in a letter dated 2 February 1939:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  I tear up my manuscripts when I have any; but in fact I make such wild sketches in hand writing alter so completely on the type writer that a manuscript of mine is mostly nonsense. And I don’t like to sell nonsense; nor do I think it would sell; for no sane person could make head or tail of it. Still, I promise that I will rout among my papers and see if there’s some page not too incoherent. If so I’ll do violence to my horror of this groping and send it to the address you give.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	A subsequent letter to Elizabeth Bowen makes clear that Woolf did, in fact, donate a document related to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, presumably a manuscript or a manuscript fragment, to the Guild: “I’ve a nice letter from someone called something Jones who bought 3 Guineas, I hope for a large sum. Will you thank her, if you see her.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Woolf’s comment suggests that she may have donated a manuscript document that was considerably larger than the “single page” that Sarton had requested, and to which Woolf had committed herself in the previous letter—for had she donated a single page, or even ten pages, of manuscript, it seems unlikely that Woolf would have made reference to someone having “<span style="font-style:italic;">bought Three Guineas</span>,” a comment that invokes the work in its entirety. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the sale of a page, or even ten pages, would be capable of generating the “large sum” of which Woolf says she is hopeful.
      </p>
<p>
	A recently translated, first-hand account of the activities of the German Academy in Exile supplies some context for the auction of Woolf’s manuscript. The event, which took place on 19 February 1939 at New York’s Hotel Delmonico, was said by <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span> to have created “unprecedented interest” within the press itself. Included in the auction were manuscripts donated by Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, Bertold Brecht, Lewis Mumford, John Erskine, and Thomas Wolfe; musical scripts by Arnold Schonberg, Kurt Weill, and George Gershwin; and original scores by Franz Liszt, Richard Strauss, Richard Wagner, and Vincenzo Bellini, among others.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Some fifty to sixty items were sold, totaling sales of $5000: these include $300 received for the manuscript of Mann’s essay, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dieser Friede (This Peace)</span>; $200 for Freud’s manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Prometheus-Komplex</span>; and $100 for the manuscript of Einstein’s 1938 Commencement Speech at Swarthmore College. The highest amount, $1700, was received for Wolfe’s “bulky manuscript” of <span style="font-style:italic;">Look Homeward, Angel.</span> Based on the above res, which account for $2300 of the auction’s total earnings, we know that the sale of Woolf’s manuscript would have brought an amount far less than the remaining $2700, given that some forty-six to fifty-six other items were also sold, placing the average sale price of each item between $48 and $58. Although earnings from the auction were far below what had been anticipated, the auction itself was considered to be successful in that it helped raise awareness of the plight of the German community in exile.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Despite Woolf’s explicit claim, no record of the sale or the donation exists among the archives of the German Academy in Exile and the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Rather, a typed list in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exilarchiv</span> indicates that Woolf had donated a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob’s Room</span>, designated “item 146” in the auction’s printed catalogue and which reads, “WOOLF, VIRGINIA: Jacob’s Room, Hogarth Press, 1922. Sm. 8vo, orig. cloth. Charles Whilbey’s subscription copy, with AUTHOR’S AUTOGRAPH INSCRIPTION, dated Oct. 1922.” It seems highly unlikely that this item would or could have been donated by Woolf herself, whose letter conveys her understanding of Sarton’s specific request for a page of manuscript for what she had specifically called an “auction of manuscripts.” Woolf’s concern that her item should earn the Guild “a large sum,” moreover, makes it all the more unlikely that she would have chosen to donate an autographed first edition, which would have brought a smaller, rather than a larger, sum than a manuscript. (Add to this her awareness that autographed first  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> editions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flush</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, which had attained recent, unprecedented success in the American market, would have been likely to fetch a larger sum than a first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob’s Room</span>.)
      </p>
<p>
	Even more compelling, and obvious, evidence lies in the item description itself: for how would Woolf have come to possess an autographed, subscription copy of a book belonging to one “Charles Whilbey”? Given the ease with which transpositions occur in typing, it seems plausible that the cataloguer transposed the letters “b” and “l” in recording the name “Whilbey” and that the copy may have belonged to renowned British biographer, essayist, literary reviewer, and columnist Charles Whibley, who was a friend of T. S. Eliot.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> While it is understandable that the archives should credit Woolf with this donation, it seems more likely that an autographed copy of a book belonging to Charles Whibley would have been donated by the latter’s estate rather than by Woolf herself. That the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> should go unmentioned in the auction catalogue does not preclude the possibility that Woolf donated it, but suggests that it may have been received too late to be included in the catalogue.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The Berg Collection is the main repository for the bulk of the holograph and typescript fragments relating to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, and University of Sussex the main repository for notes, reading notes, and scrapbooks relating to that work.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> A careful re-evaluation and collation of these documents is required in light of the confusing nomenclature (“fragments” and “notes”) used to describe these materials, and which in many instances obscures the nature of the documents themselves. The Monks House Papers, for example, include what appear to be holograph fragments of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that have been mistakenly classified as reading notes: thus, MH/B16e, catalogued as “Notes on ‘the inflated brown bug’; notes on William Holtby; ‘Letters to a Friend’; and notes for <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> (?),” appears to contain three pages of holograph; MH/B16c, catalogued as “Notes about Women, War and other subjects,” appears to contain several pages of a holograph fragment interspersed among pages of Woolf’s notes; and MH/B16a, catalogued as “Reading notes for the above [<span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>],” appears to contain four pages of holograph interspersed among her reading notes.
      </p>
<p>
	A further editorial difficulty is posed by the Berg’s description in its finding aid of the largest chunk of holograph in M28 as “Fragment, with the author’s ms. corrections. Holograph, 90 p. Sept. 21 [n.y].” This description mistakenly implies the existence of a larger, continuously paginated document that is more accurately described as a series of fragments—“an assemblage of texts, a polytext of seriated texts and versions” comprised of passages that Woolf appears to have compulsively rewritten (<span style="font-style:italic;">TA,</span> 99). As a habitual reviser of her work, Woolf would reach a particular stage in the composition of a passage only to return immediately to its beginning, rewriting and correcting it as if realizing what she wanted to say only through these successive attempts to say it. Consider, for example, the sequence of manuscript revisions that exist for the passage in which Woolf’s speaker contemplates the potential effect of “250, or 50, or 25” people “pledged not to commit adultery of the brain.” In the American edition, the published version of the passage reads:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Now suppose, Madam, that there were 250, or 50, or 25 such people in existence, people pledged not to commit adultery of the brain, so that it was unnecessary to strip what they said of its money motive, power motive, advertisement motive, publicity motive, vanity motive and so on, before we unwrapped the grain of truth, might not two very remarkable consequences follow? Is it not possible that if we knew the truth about war, the glory of war would be scotched and crushed where it lies curled up in the rotten cabbage leaves of our prostituted fact-purveyors; . . . if newspapers were written by people whose sole object in writing was to tell the truth about politics and the truth about art we should not believe in war, and we should believe in art.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	This passage underwent at least three successive rewritings in the first four pages of what appears to be a continuously paginated holograph fragment contained among the Berg’s collection of holograph fragments (M28). The revisions to this passage [<a name="2-text" href="#2"><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2</span></a>] show Woolf to have been working through questions of the utmost importance to her work during the very act of composition: namely, <span style="font-style:italic;">how many</span> people need bind themselves to this oath in order for its twin aims to be achieved? <span style="font-style:italic;">Who</span> may bind themselves to this oath?

</div>
<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>
	In the first passage, Woolf modifies an earlier insistency by deleting the word “quite” from the phrase “quite certain,” but still manages to convey a sense of certainty through her use of the qualifiers “not” and “but even” (“not two hundred, but even one hundred or fifty”). In the second passage, she drastically and somewhat mysteriously (perhaps in a moment of optimism) reduces the number of people from 200, 100, or 50 to 50, 20, or 10. Equally mysterious are the subsequent revisions that gradually increase these numbers to an amount—250, 50, or 25—closer to that of the first passage: a move that may suggest her renewed confidence in the earlier idea, or a gradual fading of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the sudden flash of political optimism revealed in the second passage. The revisions above also importantly reveal the direction of her thinking about questions of political agency, gender, and audience. For while the <span style="font-style:italic;">who</span> of the political action is restricted to daughters of educated men in the first passage, it is expanded to include “either sex” in the second passage; all reference to gender is abandoned in favor of “people” in the third and fourth passages in what may be viewed as an attempt to broaden her working base. That the implied audience, too, should undergo a gender transformation in these revisions, morphing from a male audience to an audience of unspecified gender and, finally, to an audience that is distinctly female, suggests that while Woolf was moved to include men among those who might participate in the various peace culture-creating activities she describes, it is specifically women to whom the details of these activities must be directed.
      </p>
<p>
	Such patterned rewriting scattered throughout the holograph draft appear to be instances of what Hans Gabler calls “wave-crest moments” in Woolf’s writing, moments that evidence the existence of “progressively revised passages of text” within a single document.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Gabler’s observation of the typescript of <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span> holds true for the longer holograph and typescript fragments of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> found in M28 and M29:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  The typing up of first drafts (done in pen and ink) in the manner indicated resulted in typescripts that look as if they were carried forward on a wave: stretches of pages consecutively and singly numbered alternate with stretches of sheets typed for a second or third time with identical page numbers. At such wave-crest moments in the accumulating typescript, the identically numbered pages can be identified as first, second, or third typings of the same, progressively revised passages of text.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Woolf’s progressive revisions of a particular passage of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> at the early, intermediate, and late typescript stages can be seen in the facsimiles and transcriptions included as <a name="3a-text" href="#3a">res 3</a>, <a name="4a-text" href="#4a">4</a>, and <a name="5a-text" href="#5a">5</a>, all of which Woolf numbered identically as “page 45.” The passages included as <a name="3a-text" href="#3a">res 3</a> and <a name="4a-text" href="#4a">4</a> can be found within the “21 miscellaneous pages” that follow the longer, forty-nine page M28 typescript “fragment,” while <a name="5a-text" href="#5a">re 5</a> is part of the forty-nine page typescript “fragment” itself.
      </p>
<p>
	The passage that appears as <a name="3a-text" href="#3a">re 3</a> (the first of the “21 miscellaneous pages”) can be identified as the earliest of these three typescript fragments based on several criteria: the existence of a long passage (beginning, “Now there would be no need to say this so emphatically and pictorially . . .”) not found in any of the other versions under consideration; the presence of the independent clauses “this is butter” and “this is the best butter,” both absent from the other versions; and the incompleteness of the phrase “ribbons colours &amp;c,” to which other words appear to have been added in subsequent versions. The passage that appears as <a name="4a-text" href="#4a">re 4</a> (the second of the “21 miscellaneous pages”) can be identified as an intermediate typescript fragment. This determination is based on several manuscript corrections that Woolf made at this stage, including the addition of “is comparatively,” “fulfills,” and “the advertisement function,” all of which are incorporated in the subsequent typescript version.

	is distinguishable from the later typescript version based on the presence of several words that are absent from the third version, notably “wear” and “the splendour.” The passage that appears as <a name="5a-text" href="#5a">re 5</a> (the seventh page of the M28 typescript fragment) clearly represents the textual state closest to that of the published version. This version adopts changes made to the preceding version, including the addition of the phrase “the advertisement function,” and includes other changes that are retained in the published version, including “simple” and “prime.” Changes made subsequent to the latest typescript stage are offset by braces in the synoptic reading text [<a name="6a-text" href="#6a"><span style="font-style:italic;"> 6</span></a>].
      </p>
<p>
	Each successive version is overlaid upon one another in the synoptic text in the left-hand column of <a name="6a-text" href="#6a">re 6</a>. The following guidelines will help the reader navigate the synoptic display, using it to reconstruct both the diachronous and synchronous dimensions surrounding this particular textual moment. As noted above, changes made subsequent to the typescript stage are enclosed in braces, thereby separating authorial changes (made in Woolf’s own hand) from those of a potentially more “questionable” authority (made, for example, by typists, copyeditors, or proofreaders). Readers interested exclusively in revisions traceable directly to Woolf can easily bypass this braced content. Similarly, words or phrases present at any stage of the typescript that were removed at a subsequent stage are enclosed in carets. Each version is assigned its own distinctive typeface indicating the stage at which a word or phrase first appears in the work: thus, <span style="font-style:italic;">simple</span> indicates that the word “simple” first entered the passage at the late typescript stage. The use of brackets and angle brackets in conjunction with a given typeface indicates the stage at which Woolf gave these instructions: thus, <span style="font-style:italic;">&lt;wear&gt;</span> indicates that Woolf’s instruction to add this word occurs at the intermediate typescript stage and [<span style="font-style:italic;">because</span>] indicates that Woolf’s instruction to delete this word occurs at the intermediate typescript stage. The use of carets in conjunction with a typeface indicates the last stage at which a word or phrase occurs: thus, ⁁<span style="font-style:italic;">the other sex</span>⁁ indicates that this phrase made its final appearance at the late typescript stage.
      </p>
<p>
	The advantage of such a display lies in its flexibility and its comparative usability. Once familiar with the typefaces and sigla, users can read the synoptic text for evidence of either textual variation or similitude. While variation is more prominently displayed through the juxtaposition of sequential variants, textual similitude can also be inferred from the use of distinctive typefaces, thereby allowing the reader to access the work’s diachronous and synchronous dimensions. Take the following line as an example:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  If you will excuse the humble ⁁comparison⁁ <span style="font-style:italic;">illustration</span>, your dress ⁁resembles⁁ ⁁&lt;has also the office of&gt;⁁ //<span style="font-style:italic;">fulfills</span>// <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">the same ⁁purpose⁁</span></span> {function} <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">as</span></span> the tickets ⁁on⁁ in <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">a</span></span> grocers {grocer’s} ⁁shops⁁ <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">shop</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The reader interested in tracing the genesis of this passage through its textual variants will see that “comparison,” present at the early typescript stage, is replaced with “illustration” at the second stage; “fulfills,” which Woolf identified in the intermediate stage as one of two possible replacements for the early typescript’s “resembles,” is only  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> adopted at the late typescript stage; and that “purpose,” added at the late typescript stage, was replaced with “function” at a subsequent stage, and may therefore be a nonauthorial revision. Knowing that variants are presented in a distinctive typeface that corresponds to the stage at which they entered the passage, and that any phrase or word absent from a subsequent version would be indicated by carets, the reader interested in reconstructing the synchronous dimension of a given level of the typescript would be capable of doing so. Thus, a reader attempting to reconstruct the later typescript stage would be able to infer that the passage had read “illustration” from the intermediate stage onward; that the proposed phrase, “has also the office of,” simultaneously appeared and disappeared at the intermediate stage in favor of the word “fulfills,” which is adopted at the late typescript phase; and that the word “purpose” appears for the last time in the late typescript stage. In this way, the reader would be able to correctly reconstruct the following sentence of the late typescript stage from the coding and typefaces used in the synoptic text alone: “<span style="font-style:italic;">If you will excuse the humble illustration, your dress fulfills the same purpose as the tickets in a grocers shop.</span>”
      </p>
<p>
	The early typescript passage ponders the psychology of the man in uniform and clearly repudiates an essentialist view of gender. Wondering why men go to the “expense and discomfort to assume uniforms that are always gaudy and often uncomfortable,” she concludes that the resulting admiration of women is a “bribe by which you [recompense] &lt;reward&gt; yourselves for doing what is distasteful to you.” The removal of this passage from the intermediate typescript moves the speaker away from imaginative sympathy for men and softens her indictment of women in this spot, while its replacement with an analysis of the “advertisement function” of men’s dress distances the speaker from the object of her view. More than a loose assortment of variants, this sequence of revisions achieves a distinct rhetorical effect, thus suggesting an altered, or shifting, intention on Woolf’s part. A marginal note made at the late typescript stage further complicates the matter of how one might interpret this sequence of revisions: for there she has hastily scribbled the line, “Why, if you possess a quality, do you wish to advertise the fact”—a comment that suggests a persistent, or perhaps simply an intermittent, desire to reintroduce the subject of men’s psychology that had been removed at the intermediate typescript stage.
      </p>
<p>
	An apparent limitation of the synoptic reading text is its relative inaccessibility and the demand that it places on the reader to perform intraversional comparison. The relentlessly democratic nature of this kind of display, moreover, equalizes all variants and refuses to distinguish their relative significance to the work at hand. With no room for editorial commentary, and no additional space in which to contemplate the effects or significance of a particular sequence of revisions, the sample synoptic text under consideration cannot bring to the reader’s attention the shift in content, tone, and intention that is the result of revisions made between the early and intermediate typescript stages.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Notes toward a Fluid-Text Edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>
</h1>
<p>
	A viable alternative to the genetic edition is John Bryant’s fluid-text edition, which is predicated on a postmodernist view of fluidity as “an inherent condition of any written document and in writing itself,” a condition that aligns it with textual instability and indeterminacy (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 1, 6). Rather than rely on readers to perform interversional comparison and analysis, the editor of the fluid-text edition highlights selected revision sequences and effectively “narrates” them for the reader, assuming a more active role, and voice, in the text and creating a paratext with a potentially powerful ideological function. As Bryant writes, it is the task of the fluid-text editor to “expose readers to the <span style="font-style:italic;">distances between</span> multiple versions,” to “map out the variation, chart paths from one version to another, and enable users to lead themselves along those paths” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 123). This edition showcases the fluid condition of the work by mapping selected “revision sites” onto a base version of the work, which are then accompanied by a “revision sequence” and “revision narrative” that supplies a possible explanation for the particular revision made at that site (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 151).
      </p>
<p>
	re Seven depicts an image of what a fluid-text edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> might look like. In this passage, the speaker responds to her correspondent’s request that she join his society for the prevention of war. The fluid-text edition would allow the editor to call the reader’s attention to linguistic, rhetorical, and thematic variation between the passage as it appears in the first American edition of the work and in an earlier holograph fragment, through the use of carefully delineated revision sequences. While the earlier line emphasizes the benefits bestowed on the sons of educated men, the later one emphasizes the lack of benefits bestowed on their sisters. A transcription of the holograph passages allows the reader to observe variation in the rhetorical context of the line: where the earlier line exists as evidence of men’s investment in patriotism and nationalism, the later one exists as a rationale for women’s investment in pacifism. The revision narrative at the bottom explains the rhetorical and thematic significance of these textual variations. While the earlier passage explains the outsider’s position, the later one shows the reader how to explain her position, a difference that may indicate Woolf’s shifting intention to teach her readers rather than preach to them.
      </p>
<p>
	Revision narratives presuppose a certain degree of authorial intention, regarding each revision as “material evidence of <span style="font-style:italic;">shifting</span> intentions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 9). While Bryant’s call for a modified recuperation of the notion of authorial intention may seem to reside uneasily with the aims of an otherwise post-eclectic edition, his use of the term is thoroughly inflected by postmodernist notions of simultaneity and multiplicity, and reflects the realization that “even a given author at a given moment often displays not a monolithic singularity of purpose or desire, but rather a multiplicity of them embodied in a multiplicity of intentions.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> It is this “multiplicity of intentions” that can be discovered within the single variant, as Bryant explains:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  A cancellation or insertion in manuscript is the visible sign of altered intentions. When we observe a revision, we “see” the vestige of a writer’s changings, and in this way the writer’s absence takes on more presence, or more precisely, we begin to perceive layerings  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of absence. A revision has a beginning, middle, and end, and its end does not negate the beginning or middle. A revision occupies space and reflects the passage of time; it reveals options and choices; it has direction. It is a chord of dissonances and harmonies, and not a single note. A writer’s revision presents us with multiple texts vying for position on the page.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 12–13)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Rather than a unified <span style="font-style:italic;">objet d’art</span>, constructed in a linear fashion from a set of unified intentions, Bryant’s work of art is conceived as the product of tensions, contradictions, confusions, and simultaneities. Wresting the concept of “authorial intention” from its roots in textual eclecticism, Bryant retools it to advance a fundamentally postmodernist view of the literary text and textuality.
	</p>
<p>
	  Bryant extends the boundaries established by other textual theorists in ways that further render his fluid-text edition suitable for a post-eclectic edition of Woolf’s work. For example, he extends McGann’s socialized view of textuality to pre-publication states, arguing that revision should be viewed as a fundamentally “social act” impacted by forces external to the self (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 58–9). Because writers “cannot avoid internalizing the problem of their socialized conditions,” he argues, “the ‘first’ communicative exchange in writing occurs not at the moment of editorial production, but at the writing desk, and in the writer’s mind” in “individualized moments of social ‘eventuality’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 54). This theoretical extension to include pre-publication states is particularly appealing for an edition of Woolf in that it would enable an editor to consider the influence of social factors—the existence of “social negotiations occurring in the creative process that are materially evident in ms revisions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 53)—on the direction of her revisions, particularly those revisions that diminish the political or polemical content of a given passage, and that may shed further light on the question of self-censorship within her revision practices.
	</p>
<p>
	  The fluid-text edition also usefully extends the material boundaries imposed by a genetic view of the work to include nonauthorial revisions and post-publication adaptations and cultural revisions. In a position that resonates with McGann’s notion that a work “incorporates, however invisibly, all of its accumulated history” and Grigely’s postmodernist notion of “textualterity,” which maintains that “the uniqueness of the unique art object or literary text is constantly undergoing continuous and discontinuous transience as it ages, is altered by editors and conservators, and is resituated or reterritorialized in different publications and exhibition spaces,” Bryant argues that the “cultural revision” of a work over its lifetime produces additional versions of that work (<span style="font-style:italic;">TA</span>, 1; <span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 108).<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> His conception of the fluid-text edition includes an electronic component capable of accommodating a work’s post-publication adaptations.
	</p>
<p>
	  The fluid-text edition looks especially promising as a model for a future post-eclectic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> in its ability to accommodate and narrate both the extensive pre-publication and post-publication documents that are known to be in existence. The recovery of the former is essential to our deeper understanding of Woolf’s practices of political self-censorship, and of her role as a public intellectual participating in pacifist and anti-fascist debates in 1930s Britain.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Attention to the post-publication versions  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	    It seems probable that the letter was actually written by <span style="font-style:italic;">Juan</span>ita Frances, who founded the Association and served on its Executive Committee, rather than by “Granita” Frances, as Snaith’s transcription reads. As Snaith notes, enclosed with this letter was a receipt for three pounds and sixpence, the amount contributed by Woolf toward publication expenses. Juanita Frances’s comment that “the publishers have the text &amp; I have instructed them to go through it again carefully” implies expressed concern on Woolf’s part that the extracts may have required some additional correction or emendation, as well as the likelihood that proofreading or correction of the text was underway at this time. Neither the records of the Married Women’s Association at The Women’s Library, nor the <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> letters file in the Monks House Papers, appear to contain further information as to where or when the extracts were published, or by whom. Further research into the possible existence of this version is clearly warranted.

	    One might further disrupt the hierarchical relation of text and apparatus by laying those parts end to end, rather than end to front, and by flipping the direction of the book itself between the two parts. In this way, a reader might physically approach the edition from either direction. In an electronic genetic edition, hypertext would obviate the need for such measures.

		<p class="display"><blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    The Academy in Exile and its aid organizations—the American Guild and its British “offshoot,” the Arden Society for Artists and Writers Exiled in England—together created a network spanning every continent. The strings of that network came together at the headquarters shared by the Academy and the Guild at 20 Vesey Street in New York. It was there that the extensive programme of assistance and aid, involving scholarships and prize competitions, advice and mediation, approaches to authorities and all sorts of other support, was coordinated, with the aim of relieving the creative and material troubles of numerous exiled intellectuals. It was there too that funds were made available for further rescue operations and for recent arrivals embarking on a new life in America.
