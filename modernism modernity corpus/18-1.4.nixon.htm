At the same time, one needs to remember that in the 1930s it was dealers and individual collectors rather than libraries or other public institutions which largely constituted the marketplace for modern or contemporary manuscripts. It is only in the 1950s that the modern archive really comes into being, and this mainly in the United States. The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Austin, Texas, officially founded in 1957, is a good example of this trend. By the time the Center was established, the university itself already had a large collection of rare books and manuscripts, predominantly from the romantic period. However, it was the acquisition of the T. E. Hanley library in 1958, containing modern manuscripts by Joyce, Beckett, Lawrence, and so forth, which laid the foundation for a new approach—already dis</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">cernible at other American university libraries—of collecting twentieth century books, magazines, and manuscripts. Hanley, when not collecting rare books and manuscripts, was a brick manufacturer, and his Beckett collection had been acquired through the dealer Jake Schwartz.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">As his debts mounted, Hanley was forced to sell his entire col</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">lection, and it was purchased by Austin for a seven-figure sum. As is well known, Jake Schwartz was something of a charlatan, but one who had a good eye for business. Carlton Lake, a scholar and collector working at Austin, suggested in a 1987 article that Schwartz had been sending Beckett various gifts—in particular tea, later a set of the </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Encyclopedia Britannica</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">—before increasingly pressing Beckett for original manuscripts, corrected typescripts, inscribed copies, and transcriptions of manuscripts, which he then sold on to Hanley, and later directly to the Harry Ransom Center in Austin. Between 1956 and 1961, Schwartz acquired a lot of material from Beckett at very modest prices and made a considerable profit from selling it on.

In May, 1961, Beckett told Wenning that in future he would not sell or give away any manuscript without consulting him; it was a tacit agreement which lasted until 1970. Over the coming years Beckett realized the true value of his manuscripts, something that was never revealed to him by Schwartz. In June, 1963, Beckett was still telling Wenning that “I feel you overestimate the value of my MSS. and hope you will not be a loser by your latest purchase. I in any case am more than satisfied with the payment already made and do not look for anything further.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>13 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">A month later he responded to Wenning’s sale of the manuscripts in question: “Congratulations on astonishing sum obtained for MSS.

Wenning was instrumental in helping various American libraries, such as Washington Library in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Beinecke Library at Yale (which acquired the </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Lessness </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">manuscripts), to build or extend their Beckett collections. The picture that emerges is clear. By the late 1960s, nearly all of Beckett’s manuscripts had gone to America, and this is a migration that extended to other modernist and contemporary writers. Accordingly, Philip Larkin, librarian at the University of Hull, advised the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries as early as 1961 that it was time that the loss of contemporary British literary manuscripts across the Atlantic was opposed. This provoked the Arts Council to set up a “National Manuscript Collection of Contemporary Poets” (later “Writers”). However, as far as Larkin was concerned, the situation had not improved by 1979, as his influential essay “A Neglected Responsibil</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">ity: Contemporary Literary Manuscripts,” published in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Encounter, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">forcefully states.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>16 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Although Larkin was of course concerned specifically with contemporary British manuscripts, the issue was largely the same across Europe. Beyond echoing wider trends in manuscript collecting, Beckett’s case is also informed by other cultural contexts. We need to remember that the publishing houses that did take him on in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s—Minuit, Calder, and Suhrkamp—had only recently been established. Indeed, well into the 1960s the more established publishing houses continued to dismiss Beckett’s work. Secker and Warburg’s readers’ reports on </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Malone Dies, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">the UK rights to which was offered to them by Grove Press in 1956, are a good example. The first reader invokes Joyce: “To my mind you either like stream of consciousness writing after the manner of James Joyce, or you consider it very clever, the sign of a genius, original and showing great intellectual prowess; or else you find it infuriating and a bore to read.” Following a brief exposition of the story, the reader goes on to write that “after falling asleep over it twice I couldn’t finish it. It has a soporific effectiveness of vividness through repetition and endless boredom.” The report finishes with a pointed remark that such writing is fashionable in France: “This book would no doubt have a few very erudite reviews and a general prestige sale to a small coterie of a few hundred who thought Beckett the ‘thing’ to read and the sign of a clever person to have read it.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>17 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">The second reader’s report for Secker and Warburg similarly states that the book may sell for “snob reasons,” but does note that Beckett is a fine writer.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>18 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">The marginal notes by the main editors at the firm, commenting on the readers’ reports, are telling; the first report for example contains the remark “Let’s leave Beckett alone!”, and the second report has the comment “Too Celtic for me &amp; diseased to my mind.” The first European archive to take a serious interest in Beckett’s manuscripts was his alma mater</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Trinity College Dublin.

A large role in the dissemination of Beckett’s archival material was played by academics. In the 1950s and 1960s Beckett was relatively helpful to academics writing about his work, resigning himself to the fact that his work invited, as he thought Joyce’s did, “such herrdoktoring.” Beckett used this term having read Hugh Kenner’s “dementedly over-explicative” </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Dublin’s Joyce, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">in a letter to Mary Man</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">ning Howe of 13 August, 1958.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>21 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">These early critics (in particular John Fletcher, Lawrence Harvey, and Ruby Cohn) were instrumental in bringing Beckett’s unpublished work to light.

He gave Cohn permission to discuss and critically comment on such manuscript material, but also stated that he did not want it to be made publicly available.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>23 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">He was, accordingly, somewhat upset to hear that Lawrence Harvey had bequeathed his collection—which included the typescripts of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Dream </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">and the short story “Echo’s Bones”—to Dartmouth College, without first consulting Beckett. With time, however, Beckett began to actively support scholarship on his work. When John Fletcher and Raymond Federman were compiling their bibliography (published in 1970), they suggested including a section entitled “Studies in Variants,” which would concentrate on “L’Expulsé” and “La Fin”; Beckett responded by saying </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:34px; margin-left:32px; line-height:16px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Ok for variants idea.

On more than one occasion he dismissed his creative endeavors from that decade. As he told John Kobler on 18 March 1967, “Harvey can tell you all about TCD rubbish and that rubbishy jettisoned novel + possibility of photostats. All in me successfully repressed,” before summing it up in a letter to Colin Duckworth that very same day: “I simply don’t want any more of my old abortions exhumed for the moment.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>26 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Beckett did, however, continue to exhume old aborted fragments and donate new material, from 1971 onward, notably to the University of Reading. Shortly after the award of the Nobel Prize in 1969, James Knowlson in Reading decided to launch an exhibition. He began collecting material for it after first contacting Beckett—the first surviving letter from the latter dates from April 1970. Knowlson had asked Beckett, through the mediation of A. J. Leventhal, whether he had any material Reading could borrow for the exhibition. Beckett responded that he did not in a letter of 26 July, 1970, but also wrote: “I had no idea you were planning an exhibition of such extent and am at once honoured and embarrassed. But above all moved by the interest and efforts of yourself &amp; your collaborators.” Even before the exhibition was launched in May, 1971, various people had suggested to Knowlson that he turn the exhibition into a permanent collection. Once the University had formally decided to pursue this path, Knowlson informed Beckett, and from February, 1971, onward the writer began to donate material to the collection, which he would continue to do until his death. As their correspondence shows, at no point did Knowlson solicit material from Beckett. Furthermore, as this correspondence, Beckett’s business letters, and the Reading records reveal, Beckett played no part in the development of the archive. He did, however, advise on issues of permissions and copyright and loans of material (he also declined the university’s offer of an honorary degree in 1985). It is crucial to note that unlike with people at other collections, Beckett formed a working relationship with Knowlson—the latter advising for example on various British productions. As a result, Beckett supported the scholarly work done at Reading, especially on his dramatic texts. He also supported the </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Journal of Beckett Studies, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">launched in Reading in 1976, by contributing several pieces across a number of issues. He also agreed to the series of Theatrical Notebooks under the general editorship of Knowlson, a project which had been initiated and developed by Charles Monteith at Faber and Faber. It was to be a project that, for various reasons would put a financial strain on all involved parties; as a result, Beckett waived his royalties so that the editors, Knowlson, S. E. Gontarski, and Dougald McMillan, could recuperate a part of their financial losses.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>27 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">In 1988, the Beckett International Foundation was founded at Reading. As the Foundation’s records show, Knowlson had already in 1986 thought of ways to establish a charitable trust that would administer the archive, and thus secure it against any unscrupulous vice-chancellor in need of a little extra cash. In spring, 1987, Knowl</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">son informed Beckett of the fact that the university had agreed to this development. Beyond supporting the project and sending a check to help set up the trust, Beckett had few dealings with the Foundation itself, with one exception: he objected to the </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:0px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">French Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, being invited to become a patron, arguing in an </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">829 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">August, 1987, letter that this would unnecessarily introduce politics into the equation. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">If Beckett was forthcoming when it came to scholarly work, he resisted other projects that he deemed too personal. At various points in the 1970s and 1980s, Knowlson was approached by publishers to write more biographical books on Beckett. He would pass these requests on to Beckett. The earliest occurs in 1972 with regard to a biography; Beckett declined stating “that this refusal will preserve you from such a senseless &amp; thankless job and leave you free for something worth your while.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>28 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Indeed, Beckett clearly did not want his personal life to become the object of scrutiny, a point force</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">fully made in a letter to Knowlson where he states that matters of “privacy” have no bearing on his work.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>29 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Moreover, Beckett was unhappy about the idea of his letters being made public. In 1975 he asked Mary Hutchinson to destroy the letters he had sent to her, pointing out that he had asked—in vain—the heirs of McGreevy to do the same. But he also understood the value of his writings in the marketplace. Thus, in 1982, having initially complained to her daughter Susan, Beckett wrote to his old friend Mary Manning Howe: </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:34px; margin-left:32px; line-height:16px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">I am grieved to hear about your ordeal. I had no idea things were so bad. When I replied to Susan about the letters I did not know you needed the money . . . If you need the money by all means sell them . . . So many of my letters are now public property that those to you + Susan may as well join them.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.2pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>30 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:0px; margin-right:34px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Today, the Beckett manuscript market continues to thrive, although it has slowed down. Beckett’s letters to Avigdor Arikha, for example, remained unsold at a recent Sotheby’s auction. Arguably the most active player in recent years has been Trinity College Dublin, buying the “Imagination Dead Imagine” notebook in 2004 after it was valued at between £150,000 and £200,000. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:0px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">What is remarkable about the Beckett archive is that it is near complete—there is no question of an authorized versus an unauthorized archive. It is available in public institutions and can be readily accessed. That is to say, little is missing, beyond material that has undoubtedly been lost in the ravages of time and the few minor drafts and abandoned pieces known to be in private hands. In this context, the </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Murphy </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">notebooks are a notable absence. It is an irony that their life in the marketplace began as an act of friendship, as Beckett gave them to Brian Coffey in 1938 for his help. They were first put on the market in 1964 by the London dealers Bertram Rota, as a letter from Anthony Rota to Henry Wenning testifies. Rota put a price tag of £1,500 on them, but they failed to sell at the London Book Fair. They were eventually bought by a bookseller, and ended up in private hands, where they have remained ever since. When asked in 1971 and then again in 1976 about their whereabouts, Beckett could not remember what had happened to them. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:0px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">The other remarkable thing about the Beckett archive is the fact that nearly half of it was donated by Beckett himself either to institutions or to friends—although, like the </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Murphy </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">notebooks, some material may later have entered the commercial literary </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:31px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">83</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">0 	</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">marketplace. This fact sets the Beckett archive apart from other post-war collections. To be sure, after 1970 Beckett was financially secure to such a degree that he could afford to donate his manuscripts, but then so was Harold Pinter when he sold his archive to the British Library for £1.1 million, or Tom Stoppard, or David Mamet when they did the same to the Harry Ransom Center. But as Beckett told John Kobler in 1973: “My life is strewn with dirty little exercise-books full of doodles and aborted writing.
