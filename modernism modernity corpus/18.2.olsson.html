<p>In the early 1960s, Sweden witnessed the advent of a new type of poetic writing. It was a writing that deviated from the lyrical protocols of the time, a writing that did not seem to pay proper attention to poetry as a conveyor of metaphoric messages or as an instrument for excavating the depths of the human soul. Thus, in the fall of 1961, the artist and poet Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, whose earlier work had gravitated towards Nonsense verse, Dada, and the practice of Marcel Duchamp, published a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">På samma gång</span> (At the Same Time), consisting of words dislodged from a dictionary, distributed symmetrically across the page.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="continued">Instead of creating semantically significant syntactic structures, Reuterswärd construed linguistic grids. Instead of stitching verbal elements together into a "living" tissue, he engineered a surface of signs, where each word constitutes an atomized and semantically multifunctional unit.</p>
<p>A few months before this book appeared, something similar took place in the new literary magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Rondo</span>. In its second issue, four texts were printed from a series of poems called "Hyllningarna" (The Celebrations) by the young poet and composer Bengt Emil Johnson.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Johnson had earlier published a few poems situated within an established modernist poetics, while at the same time paying homage to the tradition of nature poetry  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Sweden. His new work, however, moved in a somewhat different direction, partly due to his interest in contemporary music, and in particular the music of John Cage. In these poems language was processed beyond the confines of grammar, producing sound play and wild juxtapositions, forcing the reader to acknowledge "the word as such," in line with the credo of Russian futurism.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>youi o-ing youing-you yokingyou ing mouthwet you<br>slumquarters into sings<br>:to-into under front :to-in-to-you to-ing-nt-in<br>gathering lovely to<br>:a mouth–to-park-o-ing drives waltz-o-tô</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">If Reuterswärd confronted language as something to be collected, sampled, and arranged, Johnson tested the possibility of shaping or molding words as if they were some kind of physical matter. What they had in common, however, was the focus on language as <span style="font-style:italic;">material</span>, as something to construct and combine with, without the restraints of linguistic conventions or any notions of a "natural" language. Such deviations might certainly be considered endemic to poetry, but here they were pursued with an insistence and inclination towards artifice unprecedented in Swedish literature.</p>
<p>While some were bewildered by these experiments, others seemed more attuned to their workings. "A kind of concrete poetry," the critic Bengt Höglund suggested in his perceptive review of Reuterswärd in the leading literary journal in Sweden, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonniers Litterära Magasin</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">BLM</span>), at the same time reiterating comments issued earlier that year and confirming the arrival of a new genre.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> If the advent of concrete poetry in Sweden was thus announced, it was however an event marked by belatedness. Already in 1954, the poet and artist Öyvind Fahlström had declared the form's potentially prosperous future in his article "Hätila ragulpr på fåtskliaben" ("Hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy," a phrase culled from A. A. Milne's children's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Winnie the Pooh</span>), where it was presented as a challenge to the self-expressivity and symbolism of a post-romantic modernism. With a voice framed by the generic conventions of the avant-garde manifesto, and with a quote from F. T. Marinetti as supporting epigraph, Fahlström thus claimed, "Today, with laboured symbolic cryptograms, silly romantic effusions or desperate grimaces outside the church gate being propounded as the only healthy options, the concrete alternative must also be presented."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At that point in time, no one listened. But the times were changing. Seven years later, in an essay called "Bris" (Breeze), published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Rondo</span> 3, 1961, Fahlström returned to his manifesto and to his "bord," as he called his concrete poems, using a portmanteau consisting of "<span style="font-style:italic;">b</span>okstäver" and "<span style="font-style:italic;">ord</span>" (words and letters).<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Now, against the backdrop of the new poetry and art that had emerged in an international context during the second half of the 1950s—Fahlström explicitly mentions concrete poetry from Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, and other places as well as artists and composers such as Cage and Robert Rauschenberg—he considered it urgent to once again address the possibility of a poetry not anchored in narrative, metaphor, and self-expression; a poetry open to formal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and medial hybridization, to chance and procedural play, and to the exploration of the materiality of language as sound, visual conration, and, even, an object to touch.</p>
<p>However, Swedish concrete poetry was to deviate not only from the standard formats of poetry in its home environment. It would also, in part, distinguish itself from the dominant forms of concrete poetry that were disseminated globally during the 1950s and early 1960s, and thus challenge some narrower definitions of the genre.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> In this essay I will explore a few of these differences. But the main goal of the text is to map out the emergence of concrete poetry in Sweden, how its poetics of artifice were elaborated, and how it was fueled not only by its adherence to an avant-garde tradition in poetry, music, and art, but also by certain historical conditions that marked the postwar period—in particular its expanding ecology of new media. Concrete poetry's emergence during a threshold in the history of media, marked by the introduction of new technologies such as television, the tape recorder, and the computer, and new and radical theories of communication and information, such as cybernetics, is no coincidence. The postwar years might even be said to inaugurate a new "discourse network" (Friedrich A. Kittler), whose workings are difficult to trace—we are still immersed in it—but whose effects can be observed reverberating within the aesthetic practice that will be addressed here.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I</h1>
<p>The inception of concrete poetry in Sweden must then be dated to the publication of Öyvind Fahlström's article in the mimeo magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssé</span> in the spring of 1954, where it was accompanied by the poem "MOA " (see excerpt, <a name="1-text" href="#1"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 1</span></a>). This text, which was later to be subtitled "Manifesto for Concrete Poetry," was at the outset a polemic against the conservatism of the contemporary poetry scene, but its main thrust was to be found in the outline of a poetics based on language as "concrete matter." Before publishing his manifesto, Fahlström had been trying for a few years to find a way as a writer. He was sitting on a pile of unpublished manuscripts indebted to the poetics of Surrealism, especially those strands that led to Antonin Artaud and to the erotic machinations of the proto-Surrealist Marquis de Sade.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Evoking a certain corporeality and an interest in scatology and eroticism, the legacy of these writers was smuggled into his concretist poetics, and thus grafted a bodily materialism onto the linguistic materialism that was the focus of his manifesto—a bodily materialism that in the end would include all forms of physical matter.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Fahlström's key ideas, posited in his manifesto, were to comprise a kind of toolbox for future concrete poets. While starting off with claiming that one can proceed intuitively <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> according to systematic principles (he mentions, for example, the methods of twelve-tone music), he soon begins to discuss a set of formal devices. These can be organized along three vectors, similar to the tripartition of poetry by Ezra Pound into <span style="font-style:italic;">phanopoeia, melopoeia</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">logopoeia</span>, and to the analysis of the linguistic sign as a "verbivocovisual" entity, as suggested by James Joyce, and, later, the Noigandres  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> poets in Brazil (i.e. Augusto and Harold de Campos and Décio Pignatari). Firstly, Fahlström emphasizes the exploration of the visual space of the page, for example through alternative stanza formations and vertical spacing of letters and words, the aim being to liberate the reader's gaze from its linear and lateral programs. Secondly, he draws attention to the dynamics of rhythm and res of sound. And thirdly, most importantly, Fahlström suggests that one should approach language as physical matter, as a tactile object that one can squeeze and manipulate.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>KNEAD the linguistic material; this is what justifies the label concrete. Don't just manipulate the whole structure; begin rather with the smallest elements—letters, words. Recast the letters as in anagrams. Repeat letters within words; throw in alien words, <span style="font-style:italic;">plea–vroog–se–do</span>; interpose letters that don't belong, aacatioaanniya for action; explore children's secret code languages and other private languages; vocal glides: <span style="font-style:italic;">gliaouedly</span>. And, of course, newly coined lettristic words. Abbreviation—on a manic scale—to coin new words, as in everyday language [ … ].<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Through cuts and incisions into the very texture of signs, through substitutions, inversions, and interventions into the laws of word formation and syntax, the significance of the poetic text is programmatically displaced and shifted from the hermeneutic logic  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of surface writing and depth meaning, manifest media and latent message towards a play with material signifiers.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Fahlström was of course aware of a line of predecessors to his "concrete alternative." He mentions writers from "the Greeks" to Rabelais, from Lewis Carroll to Gertrude Stein, Kurt Schwitters, Artaud, and Lettrism.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> One visual artist is also cited, the Italian painter Giuseppe Capogrossi, but symptomatically—it was probably too purist in its outlook—not much credence is given to concrete art. Music, on the other hand, and especially the <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span> of French composer Pierre Schaeffer, stands out as emblematic for the poetics that Fahlström wants to expound. "If I use the word concrete in this context it is thus more in relation to concrete music than to concrete art in a restricted sense," he declares, and explicates further:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The fundamental principle of concrete poetry is perhaps most beautifully illustrated by Pierre Schaeffer's experience during his search for concrete music: he had on tape a few seconds of railway engine sound, but was not content just to follow that sound with another, even where the juxtaposition was itself unusual. Instead, <span style="font-style:italic;">he cut out a small fragment</span> of the engine sound and <span style="font-style:italic;">repeated</span> this fragment at a slightly different pitch; then went back to the first, then the second, and so on, setting up an alternation. Only then had he actually created; he had <span style="font-style:italic;">operated on the material itself</span> by cutting it up, the elements were not new; <span style="font-style:italic;">but from the new context thereby created emerged new matter</span>.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In addition to influences from literature and art, the concrete alternative thus finds support in an innovative musical practice. But beyond this cluster of intra-aesthetic impulses something else is disclosed. Schaeffer's <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span> was historically dependent on technical inventions in the realms of sound recording—without the latter the former would not exist. As Liz Kotz has suggested in a recent study, sound recording, and more specifically the tape recorder, can actually be seen as an important, if not determining instance for a wide range of innovative language based art in the 1960s.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Kotz's focus is on the American situation, and her main artistic reference is John Cage. In a Swedish context one might substitute Cage with Schaeffer, and considering the latter's prominent position in Fahlström's poetics, it is necessary to stress the role of magnetic recording in relation to Swedish concrete poetry.</p>
<p>Magnetic recording separates sounds and voices from their sources in time and space, and turns them into objects to manipulate—through technical operations such as cut'n'splice, erasure, superimposition, and so on. And, crucially, this is the operative register that Fahlström transposes to the media of language and poetry. Poetry is weaned from its aesthetic roots in the human voice and mind, and the process is relayed through the machinery of a new media technology as well as through an avant-garde aesthetics. While concrete poetry, to a certain extent, repeats forms, methods, and gestures from the early avant-garde of futurism and dada, these are not only theoretically refined through a more sophisticated "analysis" of the linguistic sign, they are also activated in a new historical and technological situation, which widens and differentiates their significance. The materialization of language in concrete poetry could thus be said both to reflect and comment upon a cultural situation in which, for example, voice was not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the identifying mark of an individual or a human body, but an acoustic effect open for technological manipulation and distribution.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>Around 1960, Öyvind Fahlström's manifesto began to circulate in Xeroxed copies among younger poets in Sweden.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Together with his poetry, and his essay "Bris", it would play an essential role in the formation of a specifically Swedish tradition of concrete poetry. Even if not constituting a <span style="font-style:italic;">movement</span> in a strict sense, the work of writers and artists such as Mats G. Bengtsson, Torsten Ekbom, Elis Eriksson, Jarl Hammarberg, Åke Hodell, Bengt Emil Johnson, Leif Nylén, and Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, would at least establish a <span style="font-style:italic;">network</span> of aesthetic (and often social) relations, connected to magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Rondo</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gorilla</span>, and to venues such as Fylkingen and Moderna Museet in Stockholm.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The term "concrete poetry" also occupied a central position in the debates about open form and the hybridization of the arts during the first half of the 1960s. In contrast to the situation in most other countries, concrete poetry in Sweden was not only presented and discussed in little magazines and similar contexts, but also in the big media.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Most collections of concrete poetry were—with some exceptions, such as Åke Hodell's small press Kerberos—published by the country's largest publishing house, Bonniers. This specific infrastructure definitely contributed to the genre's breakthrough, but the lack of <span style="font-style:italic;">alternative</span> institutional structures might also have been one of the causes for its rather quick disappearance from the <span style="font-style:italic;">literary</span> field towards the end of the decade.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Tracing the effects of Fahlström's ideas simplifies the task of mapping concrete poetry in Sweden. A key operation was, as indicated above, the "kneading" of language, a process that should begin at the lowest levels of poetry. Here numbers, graphemes, diacritical signs, code, and so on, would infiltrate the alphabet. A paradigmatic example of this mixture of sign systems is Jarl Hammarberg's rendering, in a poem, of "question mark" as "fr?g?tck?n," where three of the vowels in the word have been substituted by the mark in question.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Such an ironic intervention into the word highlights the artifice of concrete poetry, but it also points out the wider field of signification that it was to investigate, such as the relationship between symbolic, iconic, and indexical signs. In some productions of Swedish concrete, alphabetic signs were even to be excluded completely. In Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd's infamous book <span style="font-style:italic;">Prix Nobel</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 2</span></a>), a work published in 1966, but initiated in the beginning of the decade, one encounters a web of punctuation marks spread out over the pages, orchestrating an absent text or speech.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>The poem, which in part anticipates verbal operations in conceptual art, suggests an open work, a <span style="font-style:italic;">score</span>, for which the reader must provide not only voice, but also words. <span style="font-style:italic;">Spacing</span> here comes forward as the primary condition for poetry, and perhaps there is a poetic process at play already in these diagrammatic grids, these fragile framings of a supposedly absent content. When Reuterswärd made a sound recording of his poem in 1963, he subverted the idea of an absent content as well as the well-known hermeneutical expectations of filling the lacunae of a text. All that was heard from the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> grooves in the record was an ironic voice articulating "comma, comma, dash … "<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>The most conspicuous effects of this manipulative poetics would, however, surface on the level of word formation and syntax. In the same manner as elsewhere on the globe of concrete poetry, different kinds of transformations and displacements of letters were effectuated, and syntactical organization would be substituted with lists, series, grids, permutations, and clusters. A discernible difference in Swedish concrete, particularly if compared with the output of influential work by Eugen Gomringer in Switzerland or the Brazilian Noigandres poets during the "heroic phase" of concrete poetry in the late 1950s, was that these operations were often mixed with other methods, and they were not always used in a consistent manner; they were rather heuristic devices in the field of poetic research than prescriptive models to follow. One should of course be wary of constructing a monolith either of Swedish concrete poetry or its others, but where Gomringer's or the early Noigandres' works strove for brevity, balance, and isomorphism in the "verbivocovisual" complex of the linguistic sign, the poems in Sweden often tended to be longer, formally heterogeneous, and perforated by representational elements as well as semantic excess and graphic and acoustic noise.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>One reason for this can be traced to its surrealist legacy, a legacy that was denounced by several other concrete poets, for example Haroldo de Campos.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> This legacy also explains the exploration of scatological, alimentary, sexual, and dreamlike imagery in a lot of Swedish concrete, which contrasts starkly with the formal constraints and mechanical procedures of the poetry, while at the same time establishing a productive tension between human and machine, nature and artifice. The combinatorial play with letters and words would result in unsettling verbal aggregates such as "leatherbrain"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> or "siphonenvirons" (Bengt Emil Johnson), disclosing a grotesque, if not cybernetic, anatomy of alien bodies, "out of which pencils grow," to employ an image from Jarl Hammarberg, which evokes the influential notion of media as extensions of man in an even more tangible way than in the media anthropology of Marshall McLuhan.</p>
<p>Another reason for the Swedish specificities is to be found in the readiness to <span style="font-style:italic;">combine</span> systematic formal procedures with "intuitive" or "subjective" operations. Contemporary Swedish critics also tried to make a distinction between the homegrown version of concrete and its German namesake, for example, by describing the former as more subjective, romantic, organic, and handwritten.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> If this indicates a difference, it is, however, a difference in degree. Moreover, it might even be misleading when situating Swedish concrete within the larger field of poetic writing. I would rather claim that the binaries evoked here—subjective/objective, natural/artificial, expressive/constructive, organic/mechanic—binaries often used to describe, interpret, and evaluate poetry—are destabilized and challenged in this poetic project.</p>
<p>Some of this can be observed in the work of Bengt Emil Johnson. Johnson's concrete poetry was on the one hand charged by an interest in the procedures of contemporary (e.g. serial) music, on the other hand it was nourished by a verbal imagination indebted to burlesque, surrealist, and even romantic poetic imagery. In his first collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hyllningarna</span> (The Celebrations), one finds, for example, the poem "Fyra bluestexter" (Four Blues Lyrics), which, apart from alluding to Blues, employs a compositional method analogous to those in serial music. Here are the first two unrhymed couplets in the first of the poem's four sections (rendered in Swedish):<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>man har fog för sin gråsot du nu har nog närdröms ventilsystem fel<br>vart hon rör sig går hon mjukrundat mot väggförgrening gnyende svagt</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>och för sitt vågblods skull mutation när höstbensin ryker ner medarna<br>för i år och nu blundar hon självsökande i tystheten sakta tom</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Johnson's poem is constructed according to a strict rule—every line must employ the same set of eighteen vowels (<span style="font-style:italic;">aaoöiåouuaoäöeiyee</span>), with the adjunct that the first vowel in each line is displaced to the last position in the following line, thus producing a cyclic movement in the poem's sound pattern. Even if not a chance procedure in the manner of Cage, the poem is partly generated by this external constraint, and it is marked by a semantic indeterminacy. Some of the poem's syntactical oddities and coinages—"närdröms" (closedream's), "vågblods" (waveblood's) and "höstbensin" (autumngasoline)—can be attributed to this constraint or rule. But, at the same time, the poem's vocabulary is distinctly Johnsonian, as if the rule was from the beginning in sync with the poet's material and metaphoric imagination. The result is a strange mix of programmatic constraint and poetic license, objective restriction and subjective intervention, also discernible elsewhere in Johnson's work. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">III</h1>
<p>The kneading operations employed in Swedish concrete were certainly not limited to letters, words, and syntax. They were also integral or at least connected to the other two methods in Fahlström's manifesto—the exploration of visuality and sonority. These methods of materializing poetry would also pave the way for a transgression of <span style="font-style:italic;">the book</span> as the privileged media technology of poetry. The significance of sound recording was, as we saw, possible to perceive already in Fahlström's manifesto, and the conceptual proximity between concrete poetry and visual art led to an investigation of new materials and alternative venues for the presentation of poems, such as the gallery space.</p>
<p>One link between concrete poetry and sound was, as we have seen, forged through Fahlström's interest in <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span>. This relationship was at the core of his poetics, and it resulted in a transposition of methods and models between the two arts and the inclination to apply concepts from music in poetic writing. If this is something of a perennial maneuver in poetry, the tendency to entitle poems <span style="font-style:italic;">sonatas</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">quartets</span> and similar things was here expanded to include, for example, reading instructions. Some poems were also composed explicitly as <span style="font-style:italic;">scores</span> for a performance, such as Fahlström's "Den svåra resan" (The Difficult Journey) from the mid-1950s, which had the significant subtitle "For Mixed Speech Choir," and which was organized as a set of notations for eighteen different voices (<a name="3-text" href="#3"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 3</span></a>).<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Such sign/sound amalgamations reach over into the realm of <span style="font-style:italic;">sound poetry</span>, and it is difficult, if not counterproductive, to establish a generic demarcation line here. Swedish concrete poets often used res such as alliteration and assonance in an excessive way, and the kneading of letters and words makes accessible a latent acoustic space within language, either through alphabetic notations of sound, or through actual vocalizations of everything from song to soundscapes on stage, record, and tape. Several publications of concrete poetry were, consequently, supplemented either with a recording or a stage performance, such as Åke Hodell's first book of concrete poetry <span style="font-style:italic;">igevär</span> (Shoulder Arms, 1963), a minimalist satire of the military-industrial complex, consisting of a single utterance ("iiiiiiiiiiii … gev … äääää … r"), graphically extended to fill the pages of a whole book, and vocally rendered in a long and strenuous performance with six readers.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> On the whole, this performative aspect was integral to the practice, and resulted in tumultuous tours of concrete poetry through Sweden and the other Nordic countries during the years 1963–1964.</p>
<p>Even more acoustically elaborated was the development of concretist methods in the sound recording studio. This possibility was acutely present for many Swedish poets, who collaborated with engineers at Sveriges Radio (Swedish Public Radio) to explore the aesthetic potential of sound. The recordings of concrete poems, enhanced and refined through echo, filtering, and backward playback, would further evolve into work with sound collage, and eventually lead to the birth of the genre of <span style="font-style:italic;">text-sound composition</span>.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Crucial in this process were the radio pieces by Fahlström, not the least his pioneer "radiophonic poem" <span style="font-style:italic;">Fåglar i Sverige</span> (Birds in Sweden, 1962), which combined operations from concrete poetry with narrative and juxtapositions of a variety  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of recorded sounds (opera, pop music, machine guns, elephants).<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> This was certainly poetry based on the presence of sound recording technology. As Bengt Emil Johnson and the composer Lars Gunnar Bodin wrote in 1964: "Tape recorders, contact microphones and sophisticated loud speaker systems, projectors etcetera are instruments that through their sheer existence change the conditions for artistic work."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Poetry was on the verge of leaving the Gutenberg Galaxy—a tendency that would also affect the poetic production that was still to be registered in print.</p>

<p>The visually more conspicuous works of concrete poetry, however, mostly emerged in print, between the tarnished covers of the book, even though sometimes transposed to a life between frames, as in the big manifestation and exhibition of concrete poetry <span style="font-style:italic;">Svisch</span> at Moderna Museet in 1964.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> The visual imagination and methodology in Swedish concrete poetry was as vivid and various as its "tactile" and acoustic counterparts. It ranged from typewriter graphics and typographic variations to handwritten poems, drawings, and collage. While poets such as Jarl Hammarberg and Mats G. Bengtsson investigated handwriting in poems that could be related both to comic strips and to the scripts of <span style="font-style:italic;">art brut</span>, Åke Hodell, for example, explored the potential of the collage in a series of books from the period. Most convincing is perhaps his <span style="font-style:italic;">Självbiografi</span> (Autobiography, 1967) (<a name="4-text" href="#4"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 4</span></a>), where the title suggests a specific generic status, and thus a certain form, but where the reader encounters not a chronological narrative of the poet's life, but a montage of texts from Plato, Marx, Nietzsche, and others, juxtaposed with photographs from Eadwaerd Muybridge, military maps, comics, diagrams, and so  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on. The techniques used to construct this autobiography—and this is an interpretation that finds support in other works by Hodell—suggest that human identity as such is to be considered a montage, or a constantly shifting aggregate of body, mind, and various representations generated from different media machines.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p>

<p>The use of the typewriter as an excavator of verbivisual space—a privileged method in concrete poetry in general—was perhaps most dynamically realized in Bengt Emil Johnson's second book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Essäer om Bror Barsk och andra dikter</span> (Essays on Brother Rough and Other Poems, 1964) (<a name="5-text" href="#5"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 5</span></a>). Generically unstable, just as Hodell's book, this collection also testifies to the mix of organic and mechanic elements that was touched upon before.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> But, first and foremost, Johnson's book exploits the combinatorial possibilities of the verbal and the visual within concrete poetry. In his essay "Bris," Fahlström had discussed the typewriter as an instrument for poetry, and among other things he touched upon its role in constructing "word maps," a designation that fits well with the linguistic landscapes in Johnson's book.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> This is a poetry that urges the reader to wander around on a surface—or in a space, since the layering of words sometimes evokes illusions of depth. Further, to discern the visual res on the pages, or to read the words and sentences in Johnson's book, one has to change the distance  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to the actual object and even turn it around. The physical motor activity of the reader is thus more varied than the one usually accompanying readings of poetry. One might conceive of this book as a proto-<span style="font-style:italic;">cybertext</span> or as an <span style="font-style:italic;">ergodic</span> piece of literature, to use the terminology Espen Aarseth has established in his influential theory of digital texts.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Even though cybernetics, as <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> new theory of communication during the 1960s—and it would have an obvious impact on avant-garde writing in Sweden—is comically degraded in Johnson's book ("new wanking grammar"), this is a book that embraces and explores the new media conditions of poetry, while at the same time challenging their determining and regulating force on perception, understanding, and conceptualization.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Essäer om Bror Barsk</span> thus actualizes something that has been of vital concern here—concrete poetry as a poetry "in the age of media". While Swedish concrete poetry explicitly tied onto an avant-garde tradition of writing—most directly addressed, perhaps, by Fahlström in his references to Stein, Artaud, Schwitters, and others in the manifesto—there were also other factors that shaped its forms, methods, and medial materializations. Within the restricted field of aesthetic practice, music perhaps served as a primary model, even more so than literature. But the negotiation with the new media ecology of the postwar period was an equally important aspect. In Fahlström's poetics, the impact of the advent of technical sound recording was integral to the development of linguistic kneading and Schaeffer's manipulated recordings offered a contemporary frame of reference for his poetics. In Åke Hodell's poetry, modern technology was frequently evoked as formative for human identity and experience—and, of course, for reading and writing—while also being criticized for its potentially dehumanizing effects. And in Bengt Emil Johnson's work, new music and its reliance on technical sound recording would give the impulse to an imaginative use of technology, poetic constraints, and media based protocols, which were also to be challenged in radical ways, for example, as we saw, by turning the logic and the expected output of a typewriter inside out—typing a text whose signs don't come forward in a discrete series, but overlaid and blurred, by neglecting the lateral-linear spacing for a more tumultuous graphic space, by approaching illegibility instead of legibility, and so on.</p>
<p>Such features make it easy to juxtapose Swedish concrete poetry with a set of other innovative artistic practices during the 1960s, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span>, Fluxus, happenings, and conceptual art. The mutual reliance on new media led to similar formal, material, and methodological solutions, which sometimes becomes obvious, for example, in the case of a poet and artist such as Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, whose work, retrospectively, might just as well be categorized as <span style="font-style:italic;">conceptual</span> art or writing. On the other hand, as several critics have suggested in recent years, concrete poetry (also the Swedish branch) seems to anticipate the digital textuality that has been explored during the last decades. Non-linearity, hypertextuality, multimediality, and post-alphabetic writing are all characteristics that can be used to describe the "concretist" practice. Moreover, the interest in cybernetics and code, and the investigation of rule-based poems, disclose an "algorithmic imagination" at play that underpins such a comparison.</p>
<p>From the horizon of the present, (digital) media conditions might actually help us to re-frame and re-conceptualize some of these avant-garde works from the 1960s.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> But, vice versa, the concretist works can also give us a perspective on some of the historical and material conditions for the contemporary web of digital media, a web whose effects sometimes seem so exhilarating and sublime that its material and historical foundations tend to be erased. Such an observation offers a clue to the renewed interest in recent years in concrete poetry, not the least among contemporary poets. It is perhaps not only that the "multimedium" of the computer opens up a new space for exploring poetry as a verbivocovisual endeavour; concrete poetry might also offer tools  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> (even if re-formatted for a present situation) to question and complicate the features and forms of culture and media today.</p>

And in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLM</span> 8 : 627–629, the writer Sun Axelsson introduced the poets of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wiener Gruppe</span> (Friedrich Achleitner, Gerhard Rühm, and others) to Swedish readers.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>Fahlström's manifesto "Hätila ragulpr på fåtskliaben" ("Hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy") was published in the mimeo magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssé</span> 2–3 .

The most obvious change was the addition of a subtitle, "Manifest för konkret poesi" (Manifesto for Concrete Poetry), and the date "1953" (presumably the year of its composition). I will henceforth, to simplify, designate the text as "manifesto," and refer to it as "Hätila." The manifesto was first translated for Mary Ellen Solt's anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Concrete Poetry: A World View</span> (Bloomington,: Indiana University Press, 1968). In this essay I will quote, however, from a later translation that appeared in the big retrospective catalogue on Fahlström's oeuvre, <span style="font-style:italic;">Öyvind Fahlström.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f9" href="#f9-text">9. </a>Fahlström actually considers his "bord" to be objects or bodies on a par with other physical matter in the world.

Both are shaped like squares, but where the latter thrives on a meta-linguistic riddle, the former – apart from activating language's potential for both symbolism and iconicism (in C. S.
