Perhaps no question has proved as vexing as the troubled relationship
between modernism and popular culture. It is a commonplace to note
that modernist works of art were tireless in citing items drawn from
the popular, whether it was Picasso's inclusion of popular song titles
(e.g., <I>Ma jolie</I>), Joyce's complex reworkings of music hall in
<I>Ulysses</I>, or Weill's adaptations of contemporary jazz in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper</I>. This essay considers the context of T.S. Eliot's
1923 memorial essay for music-hall singer Marie Lloyd, the most celebrated
performer of English variety entertainment, and attempts to unpack the
specific meanings compressed in Eliot's invocation of the popular. His
use of that term cannot be properly interpreted, nor can relations
between English modernism and the popular be fully grasped, unless we
situate these phenomena within the larger context of the processes which
constitute authority in modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our standard readings of Eliot's essay miss the tensions that inform it.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 This is partly because they rush to confirm some pre-conception of the
 popular, but chiefly because they neglect a considerable corpus of late
 Victorian and Edwardian discourse that addressed the English popular
 and shaped Eliot's understanding of it. The popular elaborated by Eliot
 in 1923 had specific historical ties to the culture of the Victorian
 professional-managerial classes. Late-Victorian literati addressed
 the popular via the events taking place on the stages of London's
 many music-halls, events which their discourse on the halls linked
 to a larger narrative about English national character and history.
 These representations of music-hall provide a background indispensable
 to understanding a notion of the popular which Eliot

<B></B>

knew and endeavored to further, even as he reconred it. Taken together
they formed a discourse which repeatedly lamented music hall's imminent
decline. Tracing its contours will enable us to specify more fully
that version of the popular which preoccupied Eliot and Anglo-American
modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Recent attempts to explore modernism and the popular have often relied
on two sources, Eliot's essay "Marie Lloyd" and T. J. Clark's gloss on it.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 And rightly so. Clark's reading of Eliot rests on a profound grasp of the
 popular's historical derivation within the rise of commodity culture. In
 his remarkable book, <I>The Painting of Modern Life</I>, he pinpoints the
 origins of the popular in a class-based discourse. The modern popular
 has two prerequisites for its crystalization. First, there must be
 a prevalent working-class cultural form (the caf&eacute;-chantant in
 France, for example), one which is being developed into a full-scale,
 commercial leisure enterprise, appropriated and standardized by
 business-minded entrepreneurs and impresarios. The popular is built on
 working-class culture which is on the verge of becoming the commercial
 culture of urban and industrial capital.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second, the making of the popular as a discursive realm also requires
the active presence of a bourgeois subject acting in a manner hitherto
mostly unacknowledged by later historical accounts. The popular, in
this view, receives its shape and definition from a curious, intrusive
fraction of the middle-class, one more interested in artistic production
or conspicuous consumption than investment, thrift, or moral convention.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 These middle-class cognoscenti patronized the popular and represented
 it in painting and aesthetic discourse, representations which neither
 elaborate nor instantiate the popular, but obfuscate it. The popular,
 in Clark's account, is a fiction forged to confiscate the new-found
 authority of working-class performers and their culture; it is an
 interpretation which contains the working-class character of the popular
 and conceals the core of class difference that remains in a social
 world privileging the spectacle of social mobility over its reality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clark's insight, that the popular had a mid-Victorian genesis, and
was a discourse of incipient professional authority, of a new class of
salaried burghers intent on pursuing an aristocratic cultural hedonism,
is a precondition for understanding how Eliot responded to English
music-hall in the "London Letters" which he wrote for <I>The Dial</I>
and how he defined and dissected the popular in "Marie Lloyd." But does
Clark's reconstructed popular describe the same object which Eliot is
expounding? Partly. The growth of the London music-hall paralleled the
development and expansion of the Parisian caf&eacute;-chantant. And by
the late 1880s, with the growth of suburban variety-theater, London
music-hall was on the verge of losing its exclusive working-class
character and gaining a new, more upscale market demographic. Critics,
artists, marketers, promoters, and social scientists competed with
the belletristic observers of music-hall to represent it; they largely
believed--though some of them were also alarmed by it--that a new mass
culture entertainment had come to represent the national character and
attained a role in forging the national temper.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Many of these observers, whether literati or social scientists, belonged
 to the rank of the new professional classes, trained workers who saw
 their authority based on their education rather

<B></B>

than inheritance or financial holdings. They believed their observations
of the effects and significance of mass culture constituted work for
the public weal; it was their duty to sift whatever was good from the
otherwise degraded mass character of urban leisure forms. For some of
them, music-hall was valuable simply because it seemed to make visible
the specific nature of English identity, or because it was thought that
music-hall had achieved a national character in terms of its influence
and range. Here was a distinctively English art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot was clearly moved by the English popular, intrigued by that account
which cultured cognoscenti had fashioned to assess the broad significance
of London music-hall and its popularity. Ronald Schuchard deems Eliot
the last heir of aesthete musings on music-hall.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The writings of critic and poet Arthur Symons on music-hall; the wry,
 sophisticated, and contradictory appreciations of the entertainment
 by Max Beerbohm; the images of music-hall and its audiences by Walter
 Sickert; and the vision of music-hall as vital vulgarity distilled in
 the poetry of John Davidson--all these encouraged Eliot to seek content
 for poetry as well as subjects for his essays in the halls.
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Schuchard amply shows how earlier writings on music-hall influenced
 Eliot as both a poet and cultural observer, and his observations
 broadly support Clark's account of an Eliot who was influenced by the
 very concept of the popular which he was simultaneously attempting
 to interpret.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That said, Clark seems to deny Eliot the kind of self-conscious
distance towards the fiction of the popular that later critics appear to
maintain. He quotes approvingly from Eliot's indictment of the English
bourgeois in the essay on "Marie Lloyd." "I have called [Lloyd] the
expressive re of the lower classes. There is no such expressive
re for any other class. The middle classes have no such idol: the
middle classes are morally corrupt."
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Yet on Clark's own terms, Eliot's polemic cannot be taken at face
 value. Likewise, the single minded notion of class which Eliot seemingly
 propounds cannot be taken as the measure of Eliot's insight. Surely
 Eliot could take up the kind of reflexive stance which was entailed
 in the conceptual understanding of class relations that the popular
 provided. The concept of the popular which is safeguarded in this
 passage boasts a complex history of usage, of which Eliot was well
 aware. Given that awareness, could he really continue to believe in a
 totalized bourgeois class? Or that music-hall was working-class culture
 made flesh and maintained in its essence? If the popular exists largely
 as discursive mode, it exists primarily as a social construct which has
 been assembled of varied parts. It is difficult to be fully convinced by
 Clark's image of a lumpen culture in its "original consistency," a pure
 signifier of working-class culture existing prior to and utterly divorced
 from the middle-class construct of the popular (<I>POML</I>, 230).
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Such claims insinuate that performers like Marie Lloyd represent the
 popular solely on the basis of birth, a point that would not set well,
 one imagines, with either Clark or Eliot. Too many questions are finally
 left unanswered. Why does Eliot's essay so signally fail to define its
 lead concept, the popular? Why does Lloyd's death create what Eliot
 considers to be a shift in the delicate equilibrium of the social and
 moral order? Why does Eliot entertain the idea that it constitutes
 a tragic moment for the social order if music-hall is replaced by
 Hollywood cinema? After all, wouldn't the terms of the popular, as
 Clark understands them, have remained just as secure?

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Eliot's essay on "Marie Lloyd," the end of vital music-hall is
made to signify something like that favored modernist trope of crisis,
the end of art. Mass culture, instead, denotes mass produced art which
is disseminated by means of "electrical ingenuity," or cinema and radio
broadcasts ("ML," 173), and it will lead to the wholesale destruction of
proletarian moral fiber because those media foster fundamentally passive
responses to art and destroy the "natural" tendency of the working-class
to collaborate in aesthetic production. Mass culture means credulous,
lazy, and corrupted spectators; the end of proletarian culture by
necessity imperils the nation, since the working-class represent, in
Eliot's words, "that part of the nation which has perhaps the greatest
vitality and interest"("ML," 172).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This sort of talk--the abstraction of a vital and guileless people,
the equally totalized notion of "technology" which mobilizes Eliot's
disdain--sums up much that exasperates us about modernist discourse. Yet,
"Marie Lloyd" is more than a programmatic modernist stand on "the
people": it also introduces a complex notion of mediation into its
rhetoric of the popular. Among music-hall performers, Eliot maintains,
Lloyd was "the strongest" due to her "hold on popular affection," a hold
attributed to "her understanding of the people and sympathy with them,
and the people's recognition of the fact that she embodied the virtues
which they genuinely most respected in private life"("ML," 173). Eliot
values Lloyd both for her labor and her essence, for both "represent[ing]
and express[ing]" the working-class, a statement that works over,
I will argue, a major tension between these terms as Eliot understood
them. Further, Lloyd's relationship to her audience is one in which she
stands as an idealized version of the poet and critic vis-&agrave;-vis
the community. "Representation," therefore, becomes a more complicated,
mediated, and self-reflexive process than Clark's reading of Eliot
or the popular would allow. If Marie Lloyd stands in for the critic
in this new social compact, it emphasizes the collaborative work of
representation and the corporate nature of the popular itself, which is
now seen to be forged from partial views and responses moving across class
boundaries. The bourgeois incapacity for self-representation, so damned in
Eliot's barbed comments, has left Lloyd as a proxy for the intellectual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's insistence that a working-class woman represents the popular is
important. He is always aware that Lloyd is both <I>representative</I>
and <I>his</I> representative, a status which runs against the grain of
prevailing aesthetic practice. For Eliot's contemporaries, aesthetic
codes were assumed to function on a single plane, within a clearly
marked terrain. Protocols of aesthetic value and judgment invite
cultural participants to learn from models of excellence that exist
either within one's horizon, or just above it--and for "horizon," one has
history's sanction to read "class." Tracing his appreciation for Lloyd,
Eliot anticipates a key condition of our contemporary affective lives,
insofar as modernity is actualized and achieved in the search for proxies
of the inner life over, under and across social hierarchies, rather than
on the horizontal plane of status.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's alarm at the prospect that music-hall will give way to cinema may
seem excessive. But his anxiety stems in part from his awareness that a
received conceptualization of the popular was no longer fully convincing
for an increasing number of intellectuals. In that conceptualization,
London music-hall was deemed a mass

<B></B>

cultural form which could be redeemed by discerning critics insofar
as they discerned its peculiar capacity to mirror Englishness. In
"Marie Lloyd," Eliot mourns not just a singer, but also the premature
end of just this discourse of professional authority, much as Clark's
argument suggests. However, what Clark has called "terrible fiction"
(<I>POML</I>, xxvi) of the English popular did not follow a single
formula, but a much looser logic in which the popular was made to dovetail
with the recognition--or the production--of persistent traits of national
character, versions of venerable and pedigreed Englishness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Marie Lloyd" presents two strands of the popular which maintain a
troubled co-existence. One is a sentimental strand of populism in
which class is abrogated in order to create novel aesthetic protocols
for a brave new class of culture managers and administrators. Yet, this
"modernist popular," to call it that, is kept under pressure by the weight
of an accumulated discourse which insisted, always with an elegiac note,
that music-hall had accommodated the very essence of the nation, that it
epitomized the national popular. Under the influence of this view, Eliot
adopted some of its grammar and syntax to contain the novel experience
of mass culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much of "Marie Lloyd" is taken up with Eliot's anxiety that the national
popular is being displaced by the new global popular, or put another way,
that a commodity form is crowding out a unique cultural heritage, one
which is in some sense timelessly English. In part the essay's apocalyptic
tenor reflects a critical mind exploring the limits of an inherited
concept of the popular, one which had commercial music-hall, without
obvious contradiction, appear to stand outside commodity culture in the
mind of the cultural &eacute;lite. In part it reflects a latent fear that
the class of culture pundits who had tutored the poet in the popular,
a class which was itself of relatively recent date, would no longer be
authorized to define which cultural forms were truly significant. The
new global popular, represented by radio and cinema, stood for genuine
and degraded mass culture in a way that the discursive music-hall,
worked over and transformed by these thinking &eacute;lites, did not.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The inchoate quality of the memorial stems from Eliot's unconscious
struggle with a previous discoursive strain, leaving his new insights
tentative. "Marie Lloyd" bridges the shift from one version of the
popular, articulated by intellectuals in a mode which binds the popular
to the nation, to a trans-national mode of the popular. Modernism, or
at least that version of it which Eliot articulated, validated these
earlier observations on the popular which had been derived from the
English music-hall experience and built up by experts who had a stake in
articulating a national community. That new managerial or professional
class had relied on the authority that resided in national images to
anchor its own claims to expertise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The discursive tradition on which Eliot was drawing exhibited sufficient
form and thematic cohesion that it might well be called a genre--or at
least a sub-genre, one that we might name the "music-hall lament." The
lament's key traits are elaborated in several contemporary essays
on the music-hall. Music-hall, these generic essays argued, could be
best understood if situated within a specific story detailing English
national history and the presumed continuity of English character. The
lament assumes aspects of music-hall that its audiences might neglect;
it posits music-hall as a complexly significant

<B></B>

ritual, requiring lay-persons to lean on <I>aficionados</I> for
their guidance and tutelage through the interpretive maze. Many of
these late-Victorian and Edwardian essays were overtly pessimistic,
the halls were in danger of losing their authenticity, of succumbing
to decadence. The lament also served a pedagogical function for a
bourgeois readership; it encouraged them to see music-hall and mass
culture correctly, as intellectuals saw it; and it permitted critical
intellectuals to assume a tutelary role toward a public which was supposed
to follow the delicate discriminations of experts which were required
to maintain the production of the popular.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The genre first appears in 1893 with "The Pedigree of the Music-hall,"
an essay which art critic and scholar Elizabeth R. Pennell published in
the English journal <I>The Contemporary Review</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Pennell traces the rise of a communal art form that produced singers,
 comics, and entertainers who reflected the working-class audiences
 which came to the early halls. That form, Pennell warns, is already
 being threatened by the newer variety theaters which are suitable
 for family audiences. It is in danger of losing the common touch, the
 vulgarity that for discerning middle-class observers like Pennell has
 constituted its value and grounded its authentic character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To defend music-hall, Pennell adopts a paradoxical strategy: this
"modern institution" is given an almost timeless, natural origin.
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 "If the music-hall be a modern institution, the entertainment it provides
 is the heirloom of centuries. There is not a turn which is new" ("PMH,"
 580). English theater may have originated in the miracle play, as so
 often asserted, but music hall was even older. "Before the Miracle Play
 had been invented, the people of England had clamoured for variety
 entertainment, and been given it. There was not a castle throughout
 the land that had not its own special London Pavilion or Alhambra
 in miniature" ("PMH," 575). The analogies escalate in a rhetorical
 pile-up: "And the other turns boast a pedigree as illustrious and as
 long. Acrobats and jugglers, bears and dogs, by the same feats and the
 same tricks--you can see them in illuminated MSS. And old wood-cuts
 held Saxon and Norman spell-bound, as they hold the Cockney today. Not
 one number of the programme could be cited which has not its medieval
 counterpart. More of the past lives in the music hall than in any other
 modern institution" ("PMH," 583). Music hall, in short, uniquely embodies
 the national character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pennell's sketch of music-hall history authenticates the form, yet closes
on an ominous note. "For centuries Englishmen have been shaping their
variety entertainment into its present form, and now, like a child with
the toy it has been crying for, they are doing their best to destroy it"
("PMH," 583). The sudden shift in tone, though momentarily jarring, forms
part of her larger project. Although her historical account of music hall
effectively compacts it into a uniform expression of national identity, it
is conspicuously directed to a public distinct from the people supposedly
represented by or even involved in music hall's production. In fact,
she complains about "proprietors and managers, working men patrons and
artistes," all of whom "protest that the variety show is a great moral
force, an educational factor, a safeguard against intemperance" ("PMH,"
583). This view defends music hall on the ground that it is compatible
with or faithful to middle-class standards. But the popular is something
which most middle-class

<B></B>

 citizens either neglected or disdained. It requires an
expert to savor, to study, and, finally, to preserve its popular
essence. "Evidently, its days are numbered," Pennell sighs. Yet all is
not lost: "When too late, when it is no longer studied at first hand,
the scholar will learn its value" ("PMH," 583). Here is the paradox of
a popular whose authoritative status is sanctioned not by the people,
but by those qualified and trained to recognize the workings of history
and culture. Pennell's account deftly introduces the tone of elegy
and links it to an argument for the need for critical experts on the
popular. The future of music-hall, and of culture writ large, is in the
hands of this managerial &eacute;lite, whom Pennell wishes to empower,
to preserve the form.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pennell can be said to have originated the music-hall lament; dandy
and critic Max Beerbohm had the honor of codifying it. Beerbohm, having
replaced George Bernard Shaw as critic for the <I>Saturday Review</I>,
covered the turn-of-the-century London theater and music-hall scene. He
focussed on music-hall in a series of reflective and complexly deliberate
essays, which took up and further elaborated Pennell's homology between
the entertainment and national character.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The elegiac note was sounded more powerfully: music hall, he thought, was
 threatened by its commercial success. It had to be saved by connoisseurs
 who would provide professional guidance to a public they would both
 address and construct.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of all the music-hall acolytes, Beerbohm best exemplifies the generous
inclusiveness, and the decided limits, which characterized late Victorian
concepts of the popular. His admiration of the form is expansive,
but also committed to maintaining the superior stance of the critical
observer. His ironic tone never conceals his deep affection; rather,
it results in double-voiced statements, elevated praise mixed with
waspish barbs. He is certain that the halls are stupid, vulgar--and,
for that very reason, perfect. His evaluative claims subtly calibrate
differences between trained and untrained observers, yet also keep
notions of aesthetic distinction and elevation intact. His ambiguous
commendations simultaneously exalt the halls and claim possession of a
specific version of music hall, one which requires a critical discernment
to be appreciated.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These discrete claims tend to function to a single effect: the elevation
of discerning partisans over untrained onlookers. The ironic partisan
can best apprehend ties between music-hall performance and authentic
working-class character, ties lost on the mere spectator. In "The Older
and Better Music-hall" , Beerbohm muses on music hall's growing
commercial success and the appropriation of the "popular" and "vulgarity"
which it seemingly entails. Such success may well represent a crisis for
the form, but it is also an opportunity for the critic. For "a keen soul"
presented with an art in decline there are several choices. Either "the
soul lives in the future, the art lagging behind" or "the soul lives in
the past, left behind by the art."
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Beerbohm left no doubts about his own position. "In the matter of
 music-halls, I am already a staunch, even a passionate reactionary,"
 he states, announcing his "dislike [of] the fashion that now dominates
 not merely the specific palace of varieties but also such places as
 the Pavilion, the Tivoli, and even that titular home of lost causes
 and impossible loyalties, the Oxford" ("OBMH," 384)

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Older and Better Music-hall" ends with hope for the future, provided
readers heed the critic's call to action: "Can we recapture the olden
pleasure? Indeed yes. I have found a place. Let me guide you to it"
("OBMH," 383). What follows is a description of singer Harry Freeman,
whose performance style lacks the refinement of the newer palaces of
variety. "Let us go to it [the Metropolitan] often, magically renewing
there our youth. And in those dreary other halls let us nevermore set
foot" ("OBMH," 385). Beerbohm privileges the older, less assimilated
music-hall partly because he thinks it genuinely better, but partly
because it allows discerning observers to recognize and appreciate the
lineaments of national tradition in its unprocessed vulgarity. "This is
one of the advantages of the old music-hall over the new," he declares:
"it does reflect, in however grotesque a way, the characters of the class
to which it consciously appeals" ("OBMH," 384). The essay's sophisticated
and ironic partisanship becomes evidence of keen discrimination among
various cultural goods, bolstering Beerbohm's self-presentation as
music-hall aficionado. His middle-class readers, likewise, are solicited
to vote with their feet in the cultural marketplace, to patronize a
cultural form which the critic has termed "grotesque," but also "older"
and "better," and not merely the most fashionable, luxurious, or merely
available. If Beerbohm lays claim to a possession of and makes common
cause with expert rhetoric, his readers are invited to do the same,
to fashion themselves as a taste &eacute;lite.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite his condescension to the lumpen qualities he savors in music-hall,
there is an expansive aspect to Beerbohm's often cautious praise for
the form. His readers, he assumes, require guidance in negotiating a
post-literate world, where images, song, and spectacle dominate ever more
extensive realms of common experience. The dulcet tones of traditional
high culture may no longer suffice for advancing modernity, and this
very doubt bolsters faith in a compensatory expertise and authority that
can be achieved within the popular itself. The critic who works with
and upon the popular thereby assumes a new service role to readers,
training members of the dominant class in the special apprehension of
minority culture. Getting popular culture right offers the interpreter
a crucial edge over both the people and a majority of the public. Put
another way, Beerbohm's lament for the fading, vulgar halls functions
to put middle-class readers in touch with their inner aristocrat.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this point, the music-hall lament touches on professional
ideology. Since the popular has now been re-constituted as a knowledge
source, it must be hoarded as symbolic capital, with access to the
fund guarded. This parallels a step in the consolidation process of
professional identity as it has been identified by Magali Larson.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 At some point in the development of a profession, experts typically
 sustain their own identity by limiting the number of applicants who
 can be credentialed within a field. The exclusionary clause is usually
 aided by agencies outside the profession, often within the state. As
 a species of professional discourse, the music-hall lament includes an
 analogous moment when the critic looks outside his class / readership to
 consolidate the assertion of critical authority, looks instead to the
 concept or image of the nation to sanction their judgments of taste,
 and underwrites their rhetorical authority. Once English music-hall
 has been transformed into the "popular," and the popular has been

<B></B>

legitimated as a valid kind of knowledge, its adepts require a concept
of centralized authority to ensure their status. The nation does this
by metonymy. Cognoscenti pay back the privilege by reading the varied
content of the popular back into the national record.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music-hall inhabited a relatively subordinate place within the larger
culture; yet intellectuals seemed determined to claim and realize a far
more central place for it. Theirs was an attempt to broaden the terrain
encompassed by the cultural center; as a form of art and ritual, music
hall would be endowed with depth and gravity befitting its resonance
within English history. The late-Victorian compromise on the halls did
not simply sneer at the vulgarity of music-hall, but rather worried
over the meaning of vulgarity. In music-hall practice it hunted out
hints of the form's deep significance, complex truths about national
identity and history. Intellectuals, in return, could gain much from
their traffic with music hall. Increasingly marginalized in bourgeois
society by their advocacy of aesthetic value, they now endeavored to
gain a measure of credibility by insisting on the need for a middle-class
public to recognize value within the popular. In this regard, the English
popular resembles Clark's Parisian variant; middle-class identity and
authority are being consolidated by participating in and advocating
popular entertainment. Yet the popular, as defined by Clark, does not
dovetail perfectly with English circumstances. For in this instance,
not only did the critic lay claim to a certain discursive power, but
the ways in which the very notions of critical authority and hegemony
could be formulated were subtly transformed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can see these terms being negotiated in the debate over music-hall's
significance which took place in early 1914 between F. T. Marinetti,
the Futurist leader and theorist, and Gordon Craig, the English
theater critic and reformer. Marinetti's contribution to the debate,
"The Variety Theater," first appeared in Italian in October 1913; a
month later an English translation of it appeared under the title, "The
Meaning of the Music Hall"; and finally, in January, 1914, a new English
translation of it appeared, this time under the title "In Praise of the
Variety Theatre," published in Craig's own journal, printed in Florence,
<I>The Mask</I>. "In Praise of the Variety Theatre" is Marinetti's
most sustained attack on "the contemporary theatre." He urges that the
contemporary world demands a new kind of drama which should turn to "music
Halls, Caf&eacute;-chantants or equestrian circuses" for models. Indeed,
these are the only theatrical spectacles exclusively "worthy of a truly
futurist spirit." For the properly Futurist theater requires a denial
of history and tradition, which is precisely what music hall provides:
there is not "any kind of tradition: neither master nor dogmas."

In his rejoinder, which appeared in the same number of <I>The Mask</I>,
Craig singles out Marinetti's failure to discern the extensive history
and tradition of that lay behind music-hall, a failure implicit in his
anti-historical account of the halls. Drawing on the tradition epitomized
by Pennell and Beerbohm, Craig patiently underscores how music-hall
comprises and collates the very stuff of history. When Marinetti claims
it a virtue of music hall that "serious men never go to a variety show,"
Craig counters: "I do. I now go very often to a Variety Theatre and to
the Cinematograph," noting that "to watch how the conditions of these
two places of amusement vary is of considerable interest to me."
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Like Arthur Symons, Craig insists that apparently undifferentiated

<B></B>

sites of mere vulgarity in fact boast a rich and surprising diversity.
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 And, like Pennell, Craig emphasizes the accumulation of tradition
 compressed in music-hall song stylings and sketch comedy. Pointedly
 diverging from Marinetti, Craig firmly insists that music-hall is "as old
 as the valleys." To Marinetti's primitivist passion, Craig replies with
 tempered appreciation. True, Craig's statement slights the popular; "old
 as the valleys" can imply that popular entertainment is merely natural,
 intuitive activity, as opposed to something learned or cultivated. But
 the exchange revealingly suggests the range and state of contemporary
 discourse about the English popular. Marinetti's polemical attempt to
 equate popular culture with variety theater and primitive vitality could
 not be accepted by Craig or other English readers without conceptual
 clarification and some required historicizing.

G.H. Mair's 1916 essay, "The Music Hall," was published in <I>The English
Review</I>, a journal which addressed a smaller, more intellectual
audience. Mair's essay, which almost takes for granted music hall's
predominance in the London artistic scene, insists that music hall is
a proud cultural resource. Its credibility resides in its reflective
illumination of English character, an argument which easily aligns
with Pennell's sense of music- hall pedigree. The halls join transient
performance with historical tradition, suggesting the continuing vitality
of both. Music-hall embodies a continuous history, because:

it has preserved the salient qualities of its ancestry--its delight

nourishment from beneath the shams on the surface of our civilization,

Arguments concerning the natural strength and continuity of English
character assume ideological overtones, and Mair strikes a new note in the
discourse of music-hall when he proudly claims that it has transformed
London into a repository of world culture. "Just because [music-hall]
has this vitality, this close and intimate bond with its audience,
the music-hall is . . . incomparably the most elastic" ("MH," 126). He
offers a detailed inventory which suggests his satisfaction with these
attainments, all secured by music-hall:

Here, Mair echoes Pennell's fear that music-hall will be unable to sustain
itself. But Mair ascribes his fullest expression of cultural pessimism to
another voice, a music-hall devotee whom he claims to know. This partisan,
who in some respects resembles the music-hall spectator described in
essays by Max Beerbohm, offers a different, much darker account of the
form's current state, one which names the new forces that are challenging
popular music-hall, threatening to end its dominance as a ritual, and with
it a continuity in the experience of Englishness. "There are pessimists,"
he observes, "who believe that the heyday of the music-hall is over. A
plethora of internationalism, respectability and syndicated halls has
smothered, so they say, the native Anglo-Saxon vulgarity and individualism
which was its chiefest glory; and the sketch, the moving pictures and
the dancers but come to give the final blow" ("MH," 127). Mair sounds

Mair's music-hall adept reveals the extent to which the critical
mainstream had assimilated what had once been an &eacute;lite minority's
critical expectations for the form, and how far the dominant agenda had
assimilated a concept of the popular associated with it. His account
presents us with an axiom that will serve as Eliot's first principle in
"Marie Lloyd," namely, that music-hall form has something to do with
the stuff of Englishness. Indeed, all the anxieties voiced by Mair's
music-hall fan--the dangers of commercial acceptability, the marketing
of music-hall, the growing success of moving pictures--return in Eliot's
apocalyptic view of the demise of music hall and Englishness. Both believe
that the halls stand in a mimetic relation to national character; both
invest the form with the accompanying <I>gravitas</I> of accumulated
English history and culture. Both voice considerable anxiety over the
possibility that the music hall may die and national identity will be
eclipsed as the audience for "authentic" music-hall dwindles. Both vilify
the cinema as an example of "inorganic" mass culture, to which the genuine
English popular stands in stark contrast as an ideal which has realized.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Did music-hall attest to seamless continuities in the history of English
culture, or did it attest to its twilight, its impending bankruptcy? Such
a question arose from what constitutes the stuff of legitimation within
this rhetoric. Elegiac writing about the music-hall staved off suspicions
that a new order might be emerging in which both the halls and the
ideals enshrined in the literature of music-hall apology would prove
outmoded. If the lament set music-hall legibility under the designation
of national character, it

<B></B>

also set the form and the accompanying concepts under considerable
strain. At the onset of a new century, the globe was shrinking,
colonialism was embattled, and new technologies of war, travel, and
information flow were poised to overtake and overwhelm the faith in
nation and Empire. For Mair, Craig, and other apologists for the halls,
the Shaman poet of the past also served to re the only possible
future for modern art worth having, where poets will receive the requisite
dignity. In Mair, music-hall is colored by the old hues of the confident
and expansive nation-state, along with the older tints of a previous
aesthetic contract: the old world of Bardic expression.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mair's survey of the music hall reveals the constant rhetorical strain
evident in contemporary writing about it. The delight in various
forms of national character and creativity alternates with fears of
depletion. Modernity threatens to consume the resources of national
expression and destroy their links with the past, leaving intellectuals to
memorialize a vanished history. Apologists for the halls, in contrast,
sanction a sentimental appreciation of that history which the halls
have allegedly condensed. One response to such a threat is to circle
up the wagons and protect whatever remains from outsiders. Inevitably,
both Beerbohm's patron of the "older and better" music-hall and Mair's
music-hall acolyte sound a protectionist note concerning the dangers
facing English culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was within the conventions of this ambivalent tradition that Eliot's
essay on Marie Lloyd took shape, grounded in a notion of England which
for Eliot assumed "classical proportions, as Alan Marshall has put it,
an ideal and organic England with a unified tradition of practice and
character, and a sense of music hall which required a tone of elegiac
despair.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The essay posits the natural priority of local communication over
 mediated "art," music-hall over film, original performance over mere
 reproduction. The "working man who went to the music-hall and saw
 Marie Lloyd" was "performing part of the act; he was engaged in that
 collaboration of the audience with artist which is necessary in all art"
 ("ML," 174). What is mourned with her passing is not simply the loss of
 a singer or a performing style, but the end of a privileged relation
 between intellectuals, now red by Lloyd, and culture, now red
 by the working class.

Meanwhile, the new medium that had earlier served as a mere supplement
to music hall has now replaced it.

The disposable form of the new media is what Eliot believes to be
dangerous, not the content of a specific broadcast or film. Worse still,
the new mass culture seeks to embody the popular even as it negates a real
relationship between that culture and national tradition. The products
of cinema stand outside national origin, or at least attain this heady
status by virtue of their global consumption. The commodified popular
represents a new cultural force, existing on a scale that Eliot dreads.

Lloyd's particular significance as popular representative emerges as
the essay's crucial topic. The meaning of representation here looks
back to the tradition of writing about music-hall as a re for
the popular; but it also comprises the new core insight standing at
the heart of Eliot's memorial. The singer stands as "representative"
in two conflicting senses. On the one hand, it is suggested that,
through song, Lloyd represents a fact of her nature, the working-class
world from which she came. For Eliot, she stands within English history
and within a recognizable, fixed cultural hierarchy. Her achievement
and status exhibit a triumphant lack of self-consciousness, attainment
gained without analysis. Her loss is all the more final because she is an
inexplicable original, although her fidelity to her class nature remains
in the last instance, "natural," that is uncritical, since it would be
natural for working-class artists to express themselves in footloose,
naughty, but instinctive, ways. In this reading Lloyd is representative,
and also "representable" within a traditional order. The old languages
of class and national verity which had been sounded in earlier laments
about the music-hall are recycled.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet in small touches rather than broad strokes, Eliot also expresses
another story here. He strives to suggest a core of difference that exists
within the popular, to indicate that representation within the popular
can comprise contingency rather than essence, and that contingency can
encompass even performers who seem to embody a seamless relation between
audience and artists. A year before the publication of "Marie Lloyd,"
Eliot writes of a Jewish-American performer on the London stage, Ethel
Levey; he is fascinated by her calculated delivery and icy, formal remove
from the ostensible content of her performance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Her type is quite different from that of Marie Lloyd or Nellie
Wallace. She is the most aloof and impersonal of personalities;
indifferent, rather than contemptuous, towards that audience . . . Hers
is not broad farce, but a fascinating inhuman grotesquerie; she plays for
herself rather than for the audience. Her art requires a setting which
(in this country) it has never had.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Levey, the range of English national character projected at the
halls becomes richer and more varied. Despite his familiarity with the
conventions of <I>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</I> appreciation of music-hall,
Eliot moves to a conception of the popular that accommodates difference
in ethnic or gendered performance styles, one that also distinguishes
among competing aesthetic possibilities within music hall form, ranging
from the fierce and forceful Englishness of singers such as Lloyd and
Nellie Wallace to the cooler, more cerebral presentations of performers
such as Levey. This conception of the popular is no longer the monolithic
one which characterized earlier writings about music hall.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Victorian compromise concerning music hall demanded that its
proper appreciation be set within a specific tale about England and its
people, and it slighted another aspect of music-hall performance which
Victorian observers surely suspected, but which Eliot is among the first
to articulate: that celebrities like Lloyd demonstrated unprecedented
freedom in staging their status as celebrities. Indeed, Eliot may well
have been drawing on popular tradition which noted and admired Lloyd's
ability to manipulate the space between the "vulgar" content of a song's
lyrics and her own identity, her capacity to construct and deconstruct her
own image. Witness the oft-repeated story concerning Lloyd's performance
before the censors. Lloyd, the legend goes, was once called before the
Licensing Committee of the London County Council and asked to perform
a song whose lyrics had caused complaint. She proceeded to perform the
number without elaboration and won the committee's approval. Then she
immediately launched into the innocuous parlor ballad, "Come into the
Garden, Maud," by Alfred Lord Tennyson, giving it a thoroughly lascivious
rendition. Even in the early days of Lloyd's career, when prostitution
in certain London halls (e.g., the Empire in Leicester Square) was so
conspicuous that it fueled fears that the halls and their songs fostered
public lewdness, reviewers had noted Lloyd's distance from the commercial
courtesans, a distance fashioned partly by her artful re-staging of
street life. <I>The Era</I>, a popular late-Victorian trade journal for
the halls, stressed the gulf between performance and essence in Lloyd;
her performance made it clear that she "studied the habits and manners
of pavement magdalenes with adequate care and attention," and without
risk of contamination.
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lloyd's self-fashioning of her identity and celebrity resulted
in paradoxes. She was the very image of working-class lubricity, but
she also demonstrated her freedom from old rules by manipulating and
crafting the stuff of the vulgar. Something believed uncontrollable
sexuality, and in particular feminine sexuality, which was assumed to
exert predatory control over consciousness, could be crafted, stylized,
managed. As a celebrity, Lloyd occupied a contested territory which
encompassed a contradiction: she expressed erotic life as something
natural to working-class character, yet played with sexuality as spectacle
and construct.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's essay on "Marie Lloyd" trucks with the ambiguities toward essence
and art which Lloyd herself had marshalled, developing insights which
do not fit within the conventions of writing about music hall. Eliot
underscores the degree to which the audience participated in Lloyd's
performances, becoming her collaborators, and this insight widens
the semantic range ascribed to the term "representation" within the
essay. For now representation stands as willed and artful manipulation,
rather than natural fact rendered visible through a prior context of
class or history. If an implied contract exists between performer and
audience, one which licenses the performer to express and represent the
audience, then Lloyd had pushed at the limits of her own contract. In
her self-conscious challenge to the expectations that singers stand in
for their audiences, Lloyd represents Eliot himself, in a startlingly
novel fashion. It is Eliot's experience in a life lived outside the
working-class, as much as her "native" working class, which gets clarified
through Lloyd's performance. She represents Eliot

<B></B>

in an individual capacity, as well as a public manner: in the private
world of the fantasist. Lloyd's ability to remake her identity in public
offers sanction for the poet's endeavor to displace the solid facts of
class and gender in order to maintain his fandom. She manipulates class
images with a liberty that threatens the hierarchical terms set within
the Victorian compromise, where aesthetic order relied upon acceptance
of essential class difference. The compromise was manifest in the
heaps of critical praise lavished on working-class people for seeming
to reproduce, rather than revise, their image and character. Lloyd's
liberties, however, correlate with the freedoms that Eliot naturally
assumes when he presumes that a working-class English woman represents
his own place, in the England of his imagining.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, Eliot's presumption that Lloyd can represent his interests and
desires touches on our own situation, our promiscuous affiliation with
various contemporary avatars of the popular. It hints at the realization
that notions like the body, the people, and woman are simply categories,
and accordingly, might be evaded, transgressed or displaced--indeed,
are fated to be so in a new order. Lloyd plays two roles in the essay
and Eliot articulates both. The singer represents her class; at the
same time, she speaks for Eliot, to push Ralph Ellison's phrase, on a
different frequency. That Lloyd represents Eliot in this new register
implies a shift, tacitly recognized by Eliot himself, within the protocols
of representation authorized by the late-Victorian popular. According
to the Victorian compromise, the representative quality of a popular
singer confirmed pre-existing beliefs about the nature of England and
Englishness. Lloyd's performance style does remind Eliot of continuity in
English identity and history; but it also suggests a fundamental shift
within the structure of the popular, which previous intellectuals had
tended to homogenize.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Representation is not the only term in Eliot's essay which contains more
than one set of meanings. Science is another. It stands for a realm
of universal truths which will ratify what otherwise might be Eliot's
purely subjective impressions, but it also names the forces which are
fostering the new global order that is threatening the order of values
reflected in the stories which earlier critics have told about national
culture. It was, of course, nothing new for Eliot to invoke science in
his critical prose, as readers of "Tradition and the Individual Talent"
will readily recall, in which metaphors from chemistry are used to
suggest the clarity and precision of the author's arguments over the
imprecise thinking that by implication dominates the humanities.
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In "Marie Lloyd" it is anthropology which is called on to provide the
 hard, factual basis for Eliot's dark speculation that contemporary
 culture is dying. Science marks the saving difference between his
 apocalyptic warnings and the dyspeptic rumblings of the Victorian
 sage. At the same time, however, the world-weariness that ethnographer
 W. H. R. Rivers diagnoses in his subject group of Melanesians, degraded
 by their encounter with the scientific products and cultural vacuum
 of Western modernity, provides an analogue to the cultural leveling
 Eliot discerns in English audiences who can no longer appreciate
 the music-hall. This contradiction gives the essay a burdensome
 ambiguity. Science grounds the author's cultural authority, yet it
 also represents the very forces that are endangering the fragile art
 of music-hall. The new kind of popular which is emerging

<B></B>

under impress of advancing science performs in ways that render
unnecessary the conventional story about national history which was
thought to be epitomized in the music-hall. Science underwrites the
conquest of distance and makes possible a global stance that threatens
the coherence of stories about a national, homogenous cultural legacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Rivers's Melanesians only appear to designate a cosmopolitan range of
experience which exists outside the nation. Their allegorical import is
more primary, for they re the experience of cultural decline which
is occurring in a specifically English context. They stand in for the
native English. Blame for the cultural negligence of music-hall does
not fall with them; the blindness of the English to the art in their
midst is due to cultural preconditioning and the materialist ethos of
scientific progress. The Melanesians are proof that the people, faced
with the choices presented by a widely dispersed media culture, will
inevitably desecrate truly popular art. Indigenous peoples, including
the English working class, are fated to become demoralized by the forces
of a new world order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poet's dark apprehension stems from the deeper realization that
a certain kind of critical project has passed with Lloyd. The literary
professional, an expert at describing cultural work within the parameters
of the nation, is losing ground to another expert, the producer utilizing
"rapid-breeding" technology (e.g., cinema) to create transnational
works. The literary intellectual owes fealty to culture as defined by
specific, local manifestations, and the new global culture is outside his
purview. Albeit implicitly, "Marie Lloyd" contains an embryonic awareness
of the new role which the popular might assume in a world organized by
a global distribution of information and commodities, but the point is
left undeveloped, perhaps because Eliot clings to an exhausted notion of
the popular. From late-Victorian to modernist, from Pennell to Eliot,
lamenting the decline of music-hall had conferred critical purchase
on a corps of expert observers who presented themselves as capable
of discerning cultural achievement even in its decadence. The loss of
Marie Lloyd and the imminent end of music-hall signify the passing of
that project. Eliot's essay marks the final stand for one version of the
myth of the intellectual, one in which he or she served as professional
tutor for a public. That compact between the modern critic and reader
was grounded in the loyalty of both to notions of cultural and national
homogeneity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In "Marie Lloyd," Eliot all but foresees the demise of that world;
institutions of taste making that once cordoned off the popular are
being cast aside. In the new world which Eliot sees at hand, consumers
have access to an increasingly wider range of artistic options and
consciousness is permeated by the reproduction and circulation of
interiorities utterly divorced from their point of origin. Identity
markers are merely a purchase away. Even dissent can be downloaded. Racial
integration may be remote in real life, but fantasies of it are on
sale for compensatory use. Identity models for affluent white youth,
whether they express outrage, cool, or sexual confidence, leap over
racial boundaries; exemplars are as likely to be culled from hip-hop as
European art song, or from parental collections of mainstream pop. The
popular is distributed everywhere today, and is the foundation of
globalization. Defined around the commodity, identity itself becomes
plural and variegated, accommodating plural selves, not uniform souls.

<B></B>

We can be certain only that the aesthetic exemplars for our individual
fantasies of identification and representation cannot simply be read
off by the coordinates of their original social rank.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Marie Lloyd" foreshadows this new dispensation, even if it does so only
negatively as it announces an end to the old compact among criticism,
national identity, and the popular, a compact withering in the face of
global capitalism, with its enlarged markets and heightened capacity to
move cultural products across borders. The passing of Lloyd has fixed
Eliot's certainty that she spoke for both her audience and himself in a
manner that has transgressed the conventional high / low hierarchy; she
had created a new world where identification and imagination spilled over
old boundaries. Class difference, and perhaps difference in general,
no longer present a real barrier which separates the authority of
middle-class gourmands from the cultural products they savor and esteem.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fears expressed in "Marie Lloyd" and its chiliastic stance are
wildly overblown. Our current cultural situation may suggest that the
lament for Lloyd is fully justified, but that Eliot's concern over the
end of a middle class dominion over aesthetic evaluation has been proved
premature. Eliot, in mourning the loss of a compact which had permitted
intellectuals to redeem the popular and exert enough authority to make
this recognition of difference matter, also articulates the desire of
modern subjects to sentimentalize difference for culture's sake. And after
all, sentimentalizing difference is also the mean whereby contemporary
culture fits professional culture to the popular. And now, as then, what
gets sentimentalized is class; critics have never lost their belief that
genuine culture transcends its origins, or that its reception somehow
cancels out class realities. The sentimental popular treats real social
inequity and barriers as imaginary. That formula for cultural hegemony
of the new middle-class intellectuals has long outlasted the music-hall,
and for all we know, it may well survive the imagined community forged
by cinematic culture.

Eric Lott uses Clark's gloss on Eliot to read the composite, multi-class
character of the American vernacular popular established in minstrelsy;
see <I>Love and Theft</I>, 91, 103. David Peters Corbett takes Clark's
Gallic popular to explain artistic choices made by painter Walter Sickert
in composing canvases of English music-hall scenes; see Corbett's

c. 1888-1907, and English Modernism," <I>Modernism /Modernity</I>
7 (April 2000): 285-306. Like these writers, I build on Clark's
claims concerning the genesis of the modern popular in nineteenth-century
mass leisure forms, and I share Clark's understanding of the popular as
a favorite discursive form of the new professional classes. However,
I resist the implication that the popular had a simple functional use
as a working-class containment for the class promulgating the notion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT3" HREF="#REF3">3</A>.
Actually, on this point Clark's taut analysis of class and custom
goes slack. He characterizes lower middle-class audiences for
caf&eacute;-chantant as "connoisseurs of popular culture," proud
experts who "define[d] themselves by their difference from the popular
but also their possession of it" and that this possession offered this
class fraction an edge over the "mere" working-class; see <I>POML</I>,
237. Clark similarly describes the caf&eacute;-chantant paintings by
educated bohemians like Degas and Manet as the work of knowing and
superior aficions of the popular. However, terms like "professional"
and "expert" are stretched thin in the rush to harmonize these
different instances as single manifestations of a repressive culture
of professionalism. The homologies result from Clark's treatment of
the rising managerial middle-class as both a grand transformation and
mere capitalist business as usual. But not everyone is recognized as an
expert to the same degree: and either professional culture produced a new
dominant class, concerned with articulating its own codes, tastes and
opinions, or it did not. The same inconsistency toward the managerial
class (workers who are neither working-class nor owners, and wielding
power on the basis of training and credentials rather than property
or financial holdings) tempers the achievement of what remains the
classic sociological treatment of the "new class" by Barbara and John
Ehrenreich. The Ehrenreichs provide evidence that the consolidation
of professional structures reshaped the capitalist division of labor,
yet conclude by asserting that "to the extent that the PMC established
itself . . . it did so on terms set by the capitalist class." See "The
Professional-managerial class," in <I>Between Labor and Capital</I>
ed. Pat Walker (Boston: South End Press, 1979). My reading here has its
genesis in reading the introduction to Mark Garrett Cooper's forthcoming
<I>Visual Love Story: How Silent Hollywood Incorporated America</I>
(forthcoming from the University of Minnesota Press). A conviction that
professional culture transformed how capitalists wielded power underlies
my essay; accordingly, I maintain that expert culture must be treated
with a degree of specificity. My conception of the late Victorian English
managerial class as a cadre of culture mavens and hedonists is influenced
by Immanuel Wallenstein's witty and acute psychological profile of the
professional class, "The Bourgeoisie--Concept or Reality," in <I>The

In the period between 1888 and 1914, an abundance of periodical essays
seeking to interpret the deep significance of London music-hall commercial
success saw print. Most of these essays assumed that the new prominence
of music-hall resided in its ability to affect and reflect national
character for good or ill. Such essays include James Payn, "The Music
Hall," <I>Cornhill</I> 60 (July 1889): 68-79; F. Anstey, "London
Music halls," <I>Harpers Magazine</I> 82 (January 1891): 190-202;
Percy Fitzgerald, "Music-hall Land," <I>National Review</I> 15 (May
1890): 379-91; Frederick Wedmore, "Music Halls," <I>The Nineteenth
Century</I> 40 (July 1896): 128-36. Below, I discuss in detail
the possibly most influential of essays within this genre, authored by
Elizabeth Pennell.

Ronald Schuchard shows how Eliot's earliest pronouncements on music-hall
fit within the spirit of late Victorian discourse on the form, which
held that it had value as heritage culture. The Victorian cognoscenti
especially admired how music-hall seemed to express, or perhaps construct,
English character. He cites Eliot's 1921 essay, "The Romantic Englishman,
the Comic Spirit, and the Function of Criticism," which asserts that "it
is only perhaps in the music-halls" that once robust antique images of
English character, of John Bull, retain vital life. See <I>EDA</I>, 106.

Schuchard views Eliot as "the last inheritor of the music-hall mystery,"
who sorts "the unsifted residue of the 1890s" (<I>EDA,</I> 104).

It is worth remarking that the distinction between mass culture and
the popular articulated and maintained by fin-de-si&egrave;cle and
Edwardian music-hall observers does not resemble the traditional high /
low divide that scholars typically draw, but plays according to more or
less compelling versions of public culture. Intellectuals with managerial
aspirations gained a measure of authority from recognizing and presiding
over this difference, but the management logic refused to follow a
strict binary. I am not alone in making revisionist claims on modernist
culture divide rhetoric. See Corbett, cited above, but also Alison Pease,
"Readers with Bodies: Modernist Criticism's Bridge across the Cultural
Divide," <I>Modernism / Modernity</I> 7 (January 2000): 77-99;
David Chinitz, "T.S. Eliot and the Cultural Divide," <I>PMLA</I> 110
: 236-48; Michael North, <I>Reading 1922</I> (Oxford: Oxford
UP, 1999), 140-73. A claim by North is especially relevant to my
argument: that "modernism and popular culture" are "natural associates,"
a subset of "a larger cultural change in which public life and private
consciousness came to be dominated by representations, by images"
(North, <I>Reading 1922</I>, 141).

As noted above, Clark refers to the clerks and shop assistants who flocked
to see caf&eacute;-chantant singer Th&eacute;r&egrave;se perform, as
"the connoisseurs of popular culture, its experts, its aestheticians;
but expertise is a way of establishing imaginary distance and control"
(<I>POML</I>, 237).

Bill Readings suggests that the tradition of searching for a peculiarly
English artistic genius, which Pennell fosters, began with John Dryden's
construction of Shakespeare as resonant hybrid: both a natural English
force and a master of high artifice and sophistication. See Readings,
<I>The University in Ruins</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1996), 78.

These programmatic pieces include "The Blight on Music Hall," ,
"Demos's Mirror," , "At the Music Hall" , "The Older
and Better Music Hall" , and "Idolum Aularum" . Many
are collected in <I>Around Theatres</I> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf,
1930). These pieces display a range of attitudes, from condescension
to adulation. They work with a deceptive formal ease and apparent
simplicity, which never fully conceals the complex emotional range
at their core. With "At the Music Hall," (<I>Saturday Review</I> [20
July 1901]: 77), Beerbohm patronizes the halls as a nadir of popular
stupidity and cultural abjection. Nonetheless, the halls still emerge as a
cultural oasis in a period otherwise marked by sharp disjunctions between
artist, craft, and audience demand. He idealizes performer and public
in sharp statements such as this: "Turn by turn, these entertainments
have grown up with reference to nothing but the public's own needs and
aspirations. There is no compromise, no friction, between the form and
the audience. The audience is the maker of the form, the form is the
symbol of the audience." The statement reads like a codicil on Pennell's
music-hall treatise; but the keen sense of the value of music-hall for the
augmentation of critical authority is Beerbohm's own. "And thus a Music
Hall offers always a great chance to any student of humanity at large."

citation and her views on Lloyd's anti-realist performing style, contained
in her unpublished essay "Every Little Movement has a Meaning of its own:
Serious Frivolity at the Music Hall." Gareth Stedman Jones's dismissal of
music-hall as a repressive "culture of consolation" has blocked more fluid
readings of music-hall performance and audience response until relatively
recently (Gareth Stedman Jones, "Working-Class Culture and Working-Class
Politlics in London, 1870-1900," <I>Journal of Social History</I>
[summer 1974]: 490-917). See John Stokes, <I>In the Nineties</I>

Eliot observes that "a suggestive analogy" for the poet's creative
process might be "the action which takes place when a bit of finely
filiated platinum is introduced into a chamber containing oxygen and
sulphur dioxide" (Kermode, <I>Selected Prose of T. S. Eliot</I>, 40).
