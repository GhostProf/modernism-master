The original motivation for this paper was an invitation to provide the
opening address for a conference on "Rethinking Englishness: English
Art 1880-1940," held at the University of York in England in 1997,
under the aegis of the Department of History of Art, in association with
the Henry Moore Institute. In announcing an agenda for the conference,
the organisers referred to an admonition which I published in 1981
in the original preface to my book <I>English Art and Modernism
1900-1939</I>: "There is a need for a study of this period of
art which is not subject to the traditional closures on art-historical
writing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The organisers' implication was that the need still existed, and that
 the project in question was one to which the conference should attend.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I accepted the invitation with some trepidation, conscious that in the
course of the past near-twenty years, I almost alone among those likely
to attend had conducted no significant research into the English art
of the period under review. (Since the time my book was published there
has been a massive growth in studies of the subject). At the time of my
acceptance I tried the patience of a friend by describing the difficulty
I anticipated in contributing to the rethinking of Englishness. "Well",
he suggested, "imagine that someone has a gun to your head and you've
got to come up with a series of lectures on early twentieth-century
English art. What are you going to say?" The answer came easily enough:
"I'd say pull the trigger."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet, of course I felt obliged to answer to the statement to which
I had put my name some sixteen years before. The

<B></B>

results are represented in the paper that follows. Its purpose was
to make some sense on the one hand of the retrospect to which the use
of the quotation seemed to commit me, and on the other of my present
distance from the enterprise to which the quoted statement was originally
addressed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 I make no pretense to an overview of the present state of scholarship
 regarding early-twentieth century English art. As a form of individual
 testimony, this paper stands or falls by its relevance to the more
 general study of modern art, and by its bearing on conditions by which
 those engaged in comparable areas of study are variously if sometimes
 unwittingly affected.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In its original context my admonition was followed by a necessary
disclaimer: my book, I said, was not the project that I had prescribed. In
including that disclaimer I meant in part to acknowledge my inability--and
indeed my disinclination--to provide the kind of detailed social history
that seemed then to be required. My task as I saw it was simply to
review the terms upon which the modern in English art had been singled
out, and in the process to work for a more sophisticated understanding
of the nature of modernism in general. It certainly surprised me that
the book was seen as "Marxist" by some of its English reviewers and
by all of the very few Americans who noticed it. But it was certainly
<I>not</I> so seen by Timothy J. Clark, whose identification with the
Marxist intellectual tradition was more properly earned, and who supplied
a generous testimonial which the publishers in their wisdom declined to
print. Why was I so sure, then, that it was by a detailed social history
that the traditional closures on art-historical writing might be opened?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To answer that question I need to provide some background. The work on
which <I>English Art and Modernism</I> was largely based was done in
the 1960s, and it was driven by two primary motives. On the one hand I
wished to jettison a hopelessly untheorised sense of identification with
the modern in art; on the other I meant to establish some intellectual
distance from what was at the time the dominant mode of modern art
history in the English-speaking countries, which I saw as a form
of unquestioning modernist liberalism resting uneasily on a base of
snobbish antiquarianism. At the outset, I assumed that these motives
were complementary and self-supporting. But during the long period over
which I tried actually to write the book<I>,</I> that assumption was
subject to drastic revision. I was alerted to the uncomfortable truth
by friends I made among the artists of the Art &amp; Language group
at the very end of the 1960s: an untheorised identification with the
modern in art is virtually <I>indistinguishable</I> from unquestioning
modernist liberalism. It followed that an enthusiasm for the modern could
be worth little unless the culture of that enthusiasm were itself opened
to inquiry and to explanation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the original preface to my book, I represented this lesson to myself in
terms of a barely veiled reference to Clive Bell, who had suggested that
works of art speak for themselves to those who have ears to hear--which
is to say to those sufficiently sensitive to "formal qualities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 If there were any readers who still wished to persist with this
 notion, I implied, my book would disappoint them. In the spirit of this
 declaration, Clark wrote of my book that "it begins the process, which
 will surely continue,

<B></B>

of rescuing modern art from its admirers." Ironically, it was probably
just that verdict that alarmed the original publishers, who, since the
book was also to contain pictures, could only conceive of it as a kind
of coffee-table item directed explicitly at the admirers in question.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The simple explanation for my sense of the need for social-historical
detail, then, is that it was the standard counter to what has been
represented as modernist formalism, which, like so many others at
the time, I tended mistakenly to conflate with the culture of art
appreciation. If Clive Bell and others claimed that art spoke to those
who had ears to hear, then the riposte would be that the constituency
he had in view was more effectively picked out in sociological terms
than on grounds of any criterion like sensitivity. Those who had ears
to hear, in other words, had actually been identified as such long
before they had demonstrated their actual competence as interpreters or
explainers of art--or of art, at least, that was not preselected for
its congeniality to their worldviews and self-images. They were that
social section already active in France by the mid-nineteenth century
as the self-appointed proprietors of modernist culture and as arbiters
of aesthetic virtue: the advanced section of the haute bourgeoisie or
hereditary middle class; that class's semiautonomous avant-garde in a
historically significant struggle for power with the rising commercial
bourgeoisie or lower middle class. In explanation of any cultural item
favoured by the members of this avant-garde, the claim that the artist
did his work out of some inner necessity must always be asserted in
face of the vulgar "He did it for the money"--to quote a formula from
<I>Art-Language</I> of the early 1980s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Clive Bell described artists as people who "do not produce to live--they
 live to produce,"<SUP> </SUP>thus strategically putting them outside the
 human species as defined from a historical-materialistic perspective,
 since from within that latter perspective it is precisely the need
 to provide the means of subsistence that defines humans as historical
 beings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 If the likes of Clive Bell could be made adequately to represent
 the English culture of modernism, it followed that the appropriate
 tool for the critical and oppositional job must be some form of
 historical-materialist explanation: the social-historical scenario
 of <I>everyone</I> doing it for the money--or doing it, at least, in
 accordance with some commensurable material determination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the rare occasions when I can now bear to open my book on English
art, it is the untidy joins and conflicts and contradictions that tend
unfailingly to catch my eye. Attempts at a form of historical-materialist
criticism sit side-by-side with statements about individual works
of art that presuppose a form of autonomy both for the compositional
aspects of those works and for the responses they avail. So the simple
explanation for my broader assertion that a social history of English
art was needed was this: I meant to acknowledge the incompleteness of
my own scepticism regarding the values works of art had been supposed
to enshrine. Perhaps <I>English Art and Modernism</I> might have been
more coherent had it been finished earlier and before I began to have
"doubts". Then I could have more easily put it behind me and tried to
become a full-blooded social historian or social anthropologist.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This conjecture raises an alternative possibility. Might it have been
possible to sort out the contradictions in more positive fashion had
the publication been delayed even longer? The question itself goes to a
non-disconfirmable hypothesis and is no doubt fruitless to pursue. But
what can be said is that I was contracted to write a sequel on the art
of the following forty years, that I made various attempts to do so
throughout the 1980s, and that the more I wrote the worse it got.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There were many reasons for the difficulties I experienced, and of course
some of them are personal and irrelevant to the matter in hand. But my
principal problem was one that has bearing on the possible agenda for a
"rethinking" of "Englishness." The truth is that it seemed ever harder
to treat English art as a case study of the character and development of
modernism without adopting one or the other of two contrasting modes:
to contain the subject and thus to maintain its integrity, by letting
a nationalistic interest control what came up for the count as modern;
or, alternatively, to maintain a larger sense of proportion, but at the
risk of a kind of continual and unpatriotic carping at small achievements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course neither of these modes needed to be problematic, so long as
the issue of purely aesthetic merit could be kept at bay. But there
were two reasons why that proved impossible. First, was that aesthetic
merit is never pure or uncontingent--for all that some modernists are
supposed to believe that it is--so that aesthetic considerations tend
to insinuate themselves even into those texts from which they have been
most determinedly banished. Second, if the question of aesthetic value
<I>could</I> somehow be relegated to a second-order discourse--such as a
social-historical discourse about the mechanisms of fixing of value--then
there would be nothing left to distinguish and to contain Art History
as an intellectual discipline; nothing, that is, apart from professional
self-interest and bad faith.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There seemed, then, to be two equally unattractive alternatives to
consider: a social history of later twentieth-century English art
which would effectively be a form of broad socio-economic history
yet one crippled by the weakness of its examples and the evasiveness
of its judgements; or an analysis of the aesthetic character of
late modernism--in all its impurity and contingency--in which a few
English artists might just get walk-on parts. In fact the nature of the
dichotomy was already clear enough by the time my first book was finally
published. The English artist Tom Phillips was among those who reviewed
<I>English Art and Modernism 1900-1939. </I>He complained that I had
not said enough to establish a sense of proportion: to make clear--for
instance--that the best of Vorticism wasn't up to the best of Cubism. I
published a snotty letter in response, advertising my projected sequel
and assuring Phillips that I would properly delineate the confines of
the pond in which he swam, "lest the brilliance of his own splashings
be lost to view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 I felt smug about my riposte at the time, but of course it was my own
 dilemma I was really exposing. That I would somehow have to locate Tom
 Phillips and his ilk in my art-historical tableau was one of the many
 reasons I couldn't proceed with my text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It took me a very long time to silence the voice of what I came in the
end to recognise as a repressive conscience, and to admit to myself that
the sequel was a book I

<B></B>

was never going to write. The admission was liberating when it finally
came. My conclusion was that a social history of English art might well
be written, albeit not by me; but that there could be no viable study
of the modern, whether in English art or in art at large, without some
non-sociological grounds upon which to determine what is and is not
deserving of attention. And by non-sociological I mean adequately
theorised in aesthetic, or formal, or, let us say, Greenbergian
terms--a requirement which seemed to rule out any use of Englishness as
a criterion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was not entirely coincidental that my appearance at the conference on
"Rethinking Englishness" came as an interruption in teaching at a Summer
School of the British Open University, to which I was obliged to return
as soon as my paper was read. In the yearlong course on Modern Art of
which this Summer School forms a part, there is no discussion whatsoever
of English art as such.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 If selection is to be made from the period 1880-1940, how many
 works of English art are likely to be treated as exemplary in teaching
 students about art? Not about art history, but about art, for that is
 what most of the Open University's students come to learn about. The
 simple answer is that it is the negative cases that come most easily to
 mind. There are certainly didactic points that can be made by reference
 to John Byam Shaw, to Stanley Spencer, to Henry Moore at his worst. But
 we should be suspicious, I think, of the very usefulness of such work
 to the task of connecting art history to the local concerns of more
 popular disciplines: literature or history or sociology or psychology. If
 we rely on them too much, how are we to interest our students in the
 work of Van Gogh, or Matisse or David Smith, difficult as it can be to
 connect such work to anything at all without lapsing into irrelevance?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So far as art is concerned, then, it now seems hard to see an interest in
Englishness per se as <I>other</I> than inauspicious. It is less clear
that the social history of English art is an endemically unpromising
project, but it may well be. Of course the idea that works of art
"speak for themselves" is still deserving of examination. There is a
continuing need to trace those works back into the complex conditions of
their production, and to demonstrate that historical accounts of those
conditions may be--indeed must be--various and mutually inconsistent. But
over the past twenty years works of English art seem to have discovered
plenty of people to speak for them and to interpret them as the products
of a history. Social-historical exegesis does indeed have the capacity
to render any object apparently vivid so long as it can embed it in
a ramified discourse, or otherwise build a sufficient human context
around it. I say <I>apparently</I> vivid, however, because the price of
this ramification is often to render the work in question effectively
irrelevant to the larger concerns of the discourse. The harder task,
it seems, is to extract from the work of art as an intentional object
that light that reveals its own specific ramifications--harder because
these ramifications may not be such as to confirm any well-established
set of historical generalisations or any well-supported account of the
surrounding culture. It follows that the more the art is complex in any
critically significant sense, the more it matters that one stay with
it and not bury it in anecdote. It has to be said that this demand runs
counter to the prevailing professional tendency of modern art history,
which is to

<B></B>

position the work of art according to what are now seen as the defining
complexities of the discipline. Through such positioning we advertise a
degree of intellectual and methodological sophistication. This may be
all very well, but it is not necessarily the same as facing up to the
complexities and opacities that art itself may present.

This lesson was brought home to me at about the time when
<I>English Art and Modernism</I> was first published, when Art
&amp; Language's engagement with the art of painting made me both
a witness and a contributor to inescapable acts of discrimination
in the studio--acts of discrimination which tended to start with
some form of the question, "What is this thing we have made?" (<A
HREF="6.1harrison_1.html"> 1</A>). The realization that it
was modernism and not "Englishness" that I was interested in thus
coincided with a conclusion of a slightly different kind: that what
really distinguishes art from other cultural materials is its aspect
as something made, and made to be regarded as intentional under some
description--the point being that the description in question

<B></B>

will be more or less otiose or irrelevant to the making unless it poses
problems for available historical generalizations and cultural theories
and self-images. Surely, it is just this power to pose problems that we
recognize in calling a work modern. For modernism is itself a form of
criticism, and a far more complex one than many critiques of modernist
art history or modernist art criticism have been able to allow. So much
for the supposed conflation of modernism with mindless art appreciation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It seems then, that I need to reinterpret the admonition that was borrowed
to announce the agenda of "Rethinking Englishness". If the inhibiting
closures on art-historical writing are not such as to be opened by
social history, just what was the failing to which my statement was
meant to call attention? I can best explore this question by means of
a kind of case study. In the process I will try to fill out what I mean
in referring to modernism as a form of criticism.

The culminating moment in the narrative of <I>English Art and
Modernism</I> was the avant-garde phase of the mid-1930s, when
Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth pursued a highly refined form of
abstract art. Looking back to this moment as an earnest researcher in
the 1960s I saw it as the point at which Englishness became successfully
merged, however briefly, with cosmopolitan modernism. In fact to talk
of merging is to fail to catch the value I then associated with that
moment. For me, the particular virtue of Ben Nicholson's white reliefs
(<A HREF="6.1harrison_2.html"> 2</A>) and

<B></B>

of Barbara Hepworth's abstract carvings (<A
HREF="6.1harrison_3.html"> 3</A>) was that they represented the
very extinction of Englishness--of Englishness, at least, as an attribute
that might be indexed with any real critical effect to their formal
and stylistic properties. It was clear enough from comments published
at the time that this was how those works were seen by some of their
contemporary viewers. It was also clear that this extinction was felt
to be dangerous--somehow totalitarian and inhuman--and by none so much
as the articulate British representatives of a more moderate and more
domesticated modern art; people like Geoffrey Grigson, Myfanwy Piper
and, later, Robin Ironside, each of whom wrote with some sense of
responsibility and even proprietorship with respect to the values of
the national culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 I have argued elsewhere that the sophisticated litt&eacute;rateurs had
 already turned the critical climate against modernist abstract art in
 England even before the Second World War came to replenish the reserves
 of insularity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The more reason for my admiration of the artists' enterprise. Not only
 were they working against odds to bring the native artistic tributary
 into the international mainstream, in the process they were struggling
 against the inhibiting cultural power of the literary, and against the
 desires of those anxious to secure the natural world in the image of
 their own values. I'm grateful to the art historian David Masters for
 allowing me to borrow a quote that he recently elicited from Myfanwy
 Piper. Denying that her eclectic anthology <I>The Painter's Object</I>
 of 1937 was in any sense intended to make it better for the national
 culture in face of the publication of <I>Circle--</I>the determinedly
 international "<I>Survey of Constructive Art</I>" published in the same
 year--she claimed that she would have invited Nicholson and Hepworth
 to contribute had they only been "better writers".

I do not now mean to withdraw my assessment either of the singularity of
the artists' work or of the repressive nature of the writers' recourse
to insular and primarily literary values. But it seems to me that the
point may now be of limited critical interest. From the perspective of
the end of the century, we look back over a different

<B></B>

thirty-year gap, to the moment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and
to another avant-garde, also determinedly anti-literary, for all its
preoccupation with the relations of art and language. The pursuit
of the modern in art has become associated with different kinds of
critical enterprize. For my own part I recall how involvement in the
Art &amp; Language indexing project of 1972-74 seemed gradually
but decisively to transform the practical grounds of thought, and in
particular of thought about the relations between history and modernity
and between art and criticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 More generally the study of art history has become accommodated to
 critiques of modernist historicism, to forms of recuperation of the
 previously marginalized, to a dissolution of the containing boundaries
 between artworks and the world, and to an extensive questioning of
 concepts of medium, canon, mainstream and so on. From this changed
 perspective it would not be hard to represent Nicholson's white reliefs
 as late and bureaucratized forms of a historicistic modernist culture
 which had already by the late 1930s been shown up as unrealistic
 in its international and utopian pretensions. When set against the
 self-interested temporizing of the <I>litt&eacute;rateurs</I> in the mid
 to late 1930s, the idea that the European modern movement represented
 authentic mainstream culture might still seem attractive. The derogation
 of Nicholson's principled abstractions to the advantage of John Piper's
 topographical whimsies (<A HREF="6.1harrison_4.html"> 4</A>)
 must remain an irredeemably conservative and

<B></B>

provincial gambit, which is to say that it could never be justifed on
aesthetic grounds. But we have now learned to look behind the supposedly
authentic for the unsightly material it serves to occlude--and in the
case of Nicholson's white reliefs the occluded material seems to cover
all and any trace of biological determination upon psychological life. In
contrast, what now seems to distinguish such works as Hepworth's <I>Three
forms </I>in white marble ( 3) is less its modern-movement austerity
than its quasi-metaphorical identity as a trio of individuals conceived
in terms of physical touch and containment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 This may turn out to be a sentimental assessment of Hepworth's work,
 and thus one in the end irrelevant to the matter of its aesthetic
 interest. But however we decide on that issue, modern-movement claims
 for the universality of abstract art are unlikely now to recover their
 credibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="5" HREF="6.1harrison_5.html">
<IMG
ALT=""#660066" 5. "
ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/6.1harrison_5b.gif"></A>

Let me come clean, though I risk a certain loss of face in doing so. An
interest in the art of Ben Nicholson was the principal motivating force
for the work that led to <I>English Art and Modernism</I>. He played
a central role in the story it was written to tell. The painter Gwen
John, on the other hand, is not even mentioned in the book. Yet if
I were now required to choose a work by one or the other--let us say
to live with--it is the picture by Gwen John that I would take. (<A
HREF="6.1harrison_5.html"> 5</A>) Of course, such statements
of preference tend to combine rhetorical effectiveness with theoretical
emptiness. In this case, who is to decide whether I am guilty of that form
of intellectual fashion by means of which a born-again anti-modernism
gets to parade in the clothes of the postmodern; whether my eyes have
been opened by a desperate need for the

<B></B>

approval of my feminist colleagues; or whether there is no more to be made
of my decision than that the Gwen John would go better with the wallpaper?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact I have to allow each of these potential explanations to be a kind
of half truth. On the first count, as the hope of socialism sinks ever
further beneath the horizon, it would indeed be vain to look for stability
in the relations between modernism, conservatism, and Englishness. On the
second count, it would be equally vain to deny the work that has been done
by women working in the field of art history, power not simply to draw
new attention to the art of derogated women artists, but also to render
insecure many common assumptions about how and with what interests we
look, and about how we represent that looking to ourselves. And on the
last count, while there may actually be no wallpaper in my home for the
Gwen John to chime with, my reluctance to give imaginary house room to
Nicholson's work is based on the not entirely unfounded expectation that
it would sooner or later disappear without remainder into any congenial
scheme of decor--as I suspect a Mondrian or a Rothko would not.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I had better try to explain myself. In England in the 1960s it seemed
appropriate and necessary to identify modernism first and foremost with
the critique of insularity, and with the search for some broader basis
for self-criticism and for stylistic development than the native culture
on its own could furnish. In part, no doubt, this was because there
were parallels to be drawn between the significance of the European
modern movement to the English art of the 1930s, and the significance
of American modernism to the English art of the 1960s. But of course new
kinds of critical material were carried within the later developments, and
some of these, as they filtered down into art-critical and art-historical
practice, were such as to require revision of the principles upon which
those practices conducted their own forms of self-criticism. One clear
change was that the concept of art as exemplary design for a better world
came to be replaced by a view of art as necessarily resistant to the
priorities of design. It is precisely the lack of this resistance that
now makes Nicholson's work look relatively meagre in its credentials
as art. I think of a passage from a letter published by Mark Rothko in
1945: "If previous abstractions paralleled the scientific and objective
preoccupations of our times, ours are finding a pictorial equivalent
for man's new knowledge and consciousness of his more complex inner self."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 All too often now, Design History acts as the mere lubricant that
 smoothes the descent of Art History into Cultural Studies, where
 Nicholson's work remains exemplary of a certain taste, but where work
 such as Rothko's could hardly expect to meet with that combination of
 need and spirit that he looked for in his audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me make clear what I am <I>not</I> saying. I am not saying that
works of art have no stable and intrinsic properties. That they do have
intrinsic properties and that these do not change without physical decline
or intervention seems to me to be precisely what assures their abiding
value. There may be a tendency over time for judgements to converge
with regard to this value. It is this tendency that the likes of Clement
Greenberg had in mind in claiming objectivity for the consensus of taste.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<B></B>

It does not follow, however, that our views are likely to converge
upon some one true account of the properties by which that value is
established. Why should they? To paraphrase Barry Barnes, while we may
allow the work of art to be the final arbiter of any account of it,
there is no reason to suppose any tendency to convergence either in our
interpretations or in the reasons we give for our judgements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 On the contrary, how we perceive and understand the work of art
 is a matter which is subject to continual change in accordance with
 shifts in our knowledge, interests, cognitive capacities, and material
 circumstances, however banal. I am saying neither that Nicholson's work
 has somehow got worse, nor that my judgement has got better. I am saying
 that as the projective political implications of that work have come
 to seem less interesting, it has become harder to ignore those aspects
 which were always present as signs of its psychological conservatism. By
 the same token it has become easier to perceive the relative technical
 and psychological sophistication of Gwen John's work, and to connect
 that sophistication to a renewed sense of modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Specifically, her work may be associated with a current of concerns
by which painting was animated from the 1860s for about fifty years
(for instance in the work of Manet, Degas, C&eacute;zanne, Bonnard and
Matisse), which was then broken and remained largely marginal until the
1940s, but which seems to have been recapitulated first in some American
modernist painting (notably Rothko's) and subsequently in the painted
work of Gerhard Richter and Art &amp; Language over the past twenty years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 What I have in mind is the use of the opaque picture plane as a kind of
 frontier across which self-critical imaginative exchanges are conducted
 between the absorbed and self-exerting spectator on this side and
 whatever may be contained or connoted by an evoked or illusionary depth
 on the other. It is a distinctive feature of the surfaces in question
 that they are not so much the containers of mimetic worlds as scripts
 for imaginative self-transformations, among them transformations of time
 and place, of class, and even of gender. (What is it like for a man to
 be the fully imaginative, fully absorbed spectator of a self-portrait
 by a woman?
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Simply to ask that question is to bring to self-consciousness all that
 has customarily been assumed in the interpretation of self-portraits
 by men).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course the traditional form of these imaginative exchanges was
established in paintings containing depicted res. Gwen John's
paintings are thoroughly traditional in this sense. But at a certain
point the presence of the re proved unnecessary--and possibly even
inimical--to the business of modernization of the scripts in question. It
was at this point, I think, that the second major phase of abstract
painting was initiated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The important point here is that the characteristic work of this second
 phase had more in common with certain earlier rative painting than
 it did with the abstract art of the first phase, to the latter part of
 which Nicholson's work remained irrevocably attached. This is the sense,
 then, in which Gwen John's work now appears more readily assimilated
 to the critical aspect of modernism than does Nicholson's. And that is
 why she may now appear the more plausible artist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So what is the point of this lengthy case study? What does it have to
say about the traditional closures on art-historical writing and about
the means by which they

<B></B>

might be opened, if not by social-historical work? My principal point
is that it is in the practice of art that reasons are discovered for
rethinking the history of art. At present the damaging closures in
art-historical writing are thus not those that divide it from economics
or from sociology or from social anthropology; they are those forms of
professional and intellectual decorum that serve as hedges against the
inflations and deflations of criticism in practice, though the latter
change too in response to currents other than those that flow through the
academy. Wherever that academic decorum rules, the more insistently will
it be tempted to fix (and asphyxiate) the more elusive, more critical
potential of art by adopting such predicates as prove negotiable within
academic discourses--predicates like "Englishness".

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This then, is the justification I offer for my sense of distance from
the enterprise of rethinking Englishness. It is from modernity in the
practice of art that motivation to intellectual work most fruitfully
comes. When I commenced my study of English art I told myself that I
was engaged on a significant critical enterprise: that attention to
local detail would serve to expose modernism as a form of globalizing
and bureacratic abstraction. But it was always a mistake to confuse
modernism with the ideological pretensions of capitalism, or to treat
modernist theory as if it offered a complete system of speculative
logic. It is one of the most secure findings of modern philosophy
that there is no such complete system. On the other hand, we need to
account to ourselves for the processes whereby we make a kind of sense
of the world, including the world of art. What we call modernism is a
form of this accounting. To say that modernism is a form of criticism,
however, is to acknowledge that this making sense has continually to
be revised, given that there is no fixed measure of its adequacy. The
practice of art furnishes empirical--though not systematic--grounds for
the revisions in question. In other words, the intelligibility of art or
of anything else is a matter of its being continually thought about in a
manner productive of self-consciousness--of its being reflected upon and
reflected from. The necessity and continuity of this self-consciousness
is also what modernism means. It is not to be foreclosed--in the name of
"Englishness" or anything else--without a loss of critical and cognitive
vitality. It follows that there can be no end to the project of modernity,
once the process of self-questioning has been initiated and internalized,
for modernism is itself the end of epochality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we are to look for the <I>social</I> bases of a modern art, they
will be discovered in the uses to which that art is put by those in
search of other self-conscious agents, and of forms of reconciliation
with them. To concern oneself in the course of this search with a value
such as Englishness would be to behave as if there might be adequate
measures of the validity of our representations, or secure and local
points of reference for the intelligible world--possibilities which the
condition of modernity will not admit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be methodologically modern, then, is to generate that which must
necessarily be deflated. In this sense the likes of Clive Bell and
Clement Greenberg stand not as res of the failure of modernism but as
guarantors of its continuity as a critical project. It seems appropriate,
therefore, to conclude by retrieving two of their more

<B></B>

distinctive contributions to that project. Clive Bell claimed,
notoriously, that "to understand art we need know nothing whatever
about history".
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 He also proposed, however, that history might be read "in the light
 of aesthetic judgements," and even that the history of art might be
 revealing of "the spiritual history of the race".
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Clement Greenberg said that "art has its history as a sheer phenomenon
 and it also has its history as quality"; but he also said of Mondrian's
 most pared-down abstract compositions that when they are good there
 is a whole world of experience in them, and that this is not a matter
 of accident.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
These are powerful and interesting hypotheses. One speaks of the
human race, another of a whole world. If either were made to bear upon
questions of national culture and national characteristics, however, it
could only be to note the limiting effect of such considerations. With
these hypotheses in mind, it can at least be said alike of Nicholson,
of Hepworth and of Gwen John, as of my friends in Art &amp; Language,
that it was not an English art that they were working to produce.

It would be disingenuous to assume that this distance could be maintained
without some reciprocal effects. The proceedings of the "Rethinking
Englishness" conference are due to be published by Manchester University
Press. At the request of the organizers I provided an earlier version of
this paper, under the title "Leaving go and Going on", for inclusion in
the volume. After a decent interval I was informed that a decision had
been taken to exclude it from the publication on the grounds that it was
"out of keeping with the interests of the other contributors" and that it
"effectively mounted a challenge to the rationale of the collection." It
seems there are limits to the reach of "rethinking" allowable in academic
publications on the national culture. I am grateful to the editors

"Our sense of the relative orders of discourse is as follows. Within
any practice a first-order discourse characterizes the normal terms in
which discussion, business, exegesis etc., is conducted. A second-order
discourse is conventionally understood as conducted in a type of
metalanguage by means of which the terms and concepts etc. of the
first may be related, analysed etc. and their referents explained. The
requirement upon a second-order discourse is that it should be capable of
'including' the first (i.e. describing what it describes and explaining
what it explains) but that it should also furnish an explanation of
<I>how</I> (and perhaps <I>why</I>) that describing and explaining
is done. A second-order discourse thus presupposes a position somehow
'outside' but engaged with the contexts of the first. It is suggested
that a cognitively defensible discourse for the recovery of meaning from
art will have a second-order character with respect to the normal and
current means of interpretation. To the extent that this is true the
second-order discourse might be expected to supersede the first, except
insofar as it is prevented from doing so by the agency which invests
and maintains the normal order . . ." From Michael Baldwin, Charles

I think in particular of the following statement from the third of
Greenberg's Seminars on aesthetics. "Certain works are singled out in
their time or later as excelling, and these works continue to excel:
that is they continue to compel those of us who in time after look,
listen, or read hard enough. And there's no explaining this durability
which creates a consensus--except by the fact that taste is ultimately
objective. The best taste, that is; that taste which makes itself
known by the durability of its verdicts; and in this durability lies
the proof of its objectivity." This is from the text to be published
in Greenberg, <I>Homemade Aesthetics</I> (New York: Oxford University
Press forthcoming.)

"Everything of naturalistic significance would indicate that there
is indeed one world, one reality, 'out there,' the source of our
perceptions if not their total determinant, the cause of our expectations
being fulfilled or disappointed, of our endeavours succeeding or being
frustrated. But this reality should not be identified with any linguistic
account of it, or, needless to say, with any way of perceiving it, or
pictorial representation of it. Reality is the source of <I>primitive
causes</I>, which, having been pre-processed by our perceptual apparatus,
produce changes in our knowledge and the verbal representations of it
which we possess. All cultures relate symmetrically to this reality. Men
in all cultures are capable of making reasonable responses to the causal
inputs they receive from reality--that is, are capable of learning. That
the structure of our verbal knowledge does not converge upon a single
form, isomorphous with what is real, should not surprise us. Why ever
should we expect this to be a property of our linguistic and cognitive
capabilities?" Barry Barnes, <I>Interests and the Growth of Knowledge</I>
