<p>
	The final page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, the breakthrough 1935 novel by Indo-Anglian author Mulk Raj Anand, contains a two-line paraph: “Simla—S.S. <span style="font-style:italic;">Viceroy of India</span>—Bloomsbury” reads the first of these lines. “<span style="font-style:italic;">September–October</span> 1933” reads the second.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> A flourish below the novel’s main text, these lines inscribe place and date on its outer threshold in the place of the author’s signature. The novel’s placing describes the arc of a hyphenated international trajectory. It is a novel on the move. Simla: Himalayan summer capital of the British empire; S.S. <span style="font-style:italic;">Viceroy of India: Peninsula and Oriental</span>’s ultra-modern flagship ocean liner of the 1920s and 30s on the Bombay to London line; Bloomsbury: heart of the British literary avant-garde, and a milieu to which Anand was, more or less ambivalently, attached.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The itinerary moves from the clubbish leisure-spaces of the colony’s center to the artistic heart of the metropolis, via a vehicle appropriately carrying the title of the representative of sovereign power in the subcontinent.
      </p>
<p>
	The date puts the book in relation to the notorious White Paper on proposals for Indian constitutional reform of 1933, which was to become the basis of the 1935 Government of India Act. The White Paper was regarded in India as a continuation of autocratic British rule in the guise of a concession of (semi-) autonomous federated democratic structures for India.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Letters on India</span> , his epistolary critique of the imperial regime, Anand himself gave a ferocious account of the semblance of “democracy” inaugurated by the 1935 Act.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Anand tabulates the “checks against the intrusion of democracy” incorporated into an Act that claimed to introduce constitutionality.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The White Paper and the India Act came in the wake of the Gandhi-Irwin pact, the mysterious compromise made by Gandhi in 1931 during the Round Table negotiations with representatives of the British government. In 1931, Gandhi called off the powerful Civil Disobedience campaign which had held the promise of wresting real concessions from the British. “Towards the end of 1930,” writes Sumit Sarkar,
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  A contradiction was emerging at the heart of Civil Disobedience: certain forms of struggle more definitely in the control of the bourgeoisie or its dependent allies . . . were definitely weakening, while there was a possibility that other, less manageable forms (like no-rent, or tribal outbursts) might gather strength. It was at this point that bourgeois pressures for a compromise became insistent.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Sarkar goes on to detail what may have determined these “bourgeois pressures,” including the Indian middle class’ international economic ties with the metropolis, and suggests the extent to which a whole series of alternative possibilities (“like no-rent or tribal outbursts”) was thereby closed off.
      </p>
<p>
	Although Anand had completed a manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> well before 1933, he chose to inscribe that date on the last page.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> The wager of this gesture is not merely that of tying the novel to a specific year. The paraph rather lifts the novel out of an empirically indeterminate earlier time of writing, reflecting also a desired trajectory (not “homewards,” as in the novel’s final line, but rather colony-to-metropolis), as well as the necessity of that trajectory’s errancy.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The novel’s journey can never be contained by place and date; it will not necessarily “arrive” in Bloomsbury. Moreover, the printed text of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is framed by <span style="font-style:italic;">two</span> dates: 1935, the date of publication at the beginning, and the 1933 of the paraph at the end.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> This possibly inadvertent framing emblematizes the errancy of the novel’s travels, allowing us to read <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> as an alternative narrative filling-out of the time it took for the 1933 White Paper to become the 1935 Act. While this was the time it took for the strange compromise of Gandhi-Irwin to become institutionalized as law, the timing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> tells a different story of those years. Anand, in trying to establish a counter-connection between colony and metropolis, charts a route which ultimately seeks to reveal what was left out in the 1931 pact between Gandhi and Irwin. For example, some of the metonymic res of Sarkar’s “tribal outbursts,” and the varied subaltern hopes and desires invested in the image of Gandhi, reappear in the untouchables of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, and specifically in connection with the appearance of Gandhi as both icon and written text.
      </p>
<p>
	1935 also marks the founding date of the All-India Progressive Writers’ Association (PWA) in the heart of Bloomsbury. Anand was a key founding member. The events commemorated by the novel’s frame thus put it in relation both to the high politics of imperialism and to diasporic anti-colonial activism. The PWA would seek to t  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the anti-colonial t in India on the terrain of popular culture. In this context, harsh critics of the novel have claimed that Anand’s Marxism enters into a fatal conjunction with inherited class/caste superiority to produce an example of the “paternalist elitism” of a detached vanguard; or that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> “makes no place for . . . oppositional activity,” denies “power and agency” to the subaltern protagonist, and ultimately masks the political activities of the “untouchable leadership” in 1930s India.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Alternatively, critics have praised <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> for its “photographic fidelity” of realist representation, for placing “a certain previously invisible population of Indian society on the map.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> This essay concerns itself with how the language and representations of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> both address its 1933/1935 frame and exceed it. How are a) the subaltern movements indicated by Sarkar, and b) the hopes of the PWA, reflected in the language and rhetoric of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> as it takes aim at Bloomsbury?
      </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s final paraph confirms what the novel has been telling us all along: it marks the desire to carry the periphery to the metropolis so as to inscribe and make visible the unknown, excremental abjection of the colonial margin in the aesthetic heart of the center. “I had to journey away from the Bloomsbury literary consciousness to the non-literary worlds” writes Anand subsequently, but it is this journey away that makes possible the turning, troping movement of a literary return.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The gesture of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is one of connection, of undoing the symbolic opposition between colony and metropole, and the first movement of its gesture is a staging of a parallel relation of dis/connection within the colony itself: a topography of an “outcastes’ colony” both outside a town and supplementary to it, necessary for its functioning (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s opening paragraph shockingly depicts the outcaste colony as an abject, stinking pile of excrement and refuse on the margins of the town and the military cantonment, “outside their boundaries and separate from them,” as the extradiegetic narrator of this passage tells us (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). The colony is “under the shadow both of the town and the cantonment,” and these latter, like some rative pair of buttocks suspended above the untouchables’ colony, squeeze out their waste products onto it (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). Anand is, almost as a matter of course, accused of being a “bad” writer by his critics, and this particular image has itself been singled out for its “inexacti[itude].”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Shit writing indeed. These opening motifs (and the jolting style), which recur throughout the novel, summarize the relation of the untouchables to the society whose waste they clean up. They also allegorize, for the implied Bloomsbury reader, a relation between metropolis and “colony.” Yet by depicting the (untouchable) “colony” as an internally partitioned space <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the (Indian) “colony,” the novel carefully undoes the possibility of making excrementality a common point of identification for the subjects of British imperialism. “Indians” are internally divided <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> divided as a whole from the metropole, but these fissures are not symmetrical. It is this complex relation of separation and articulation that weaves together the novel’s language, its representations of subalternity, and its eccentric relation to the literary project of the PWA.
      </p>
<p>
	The lotus in the dung heap of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is the main protagonist Bakha, the generically eponymous untouchable latrine cleaner of the title. But in spite of its experimental and didactic exposé of the conditions of the marginalized in the colony,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> does not fulminate against colonialism. At first glance, it is the rigidities of the caste system and its ancient taboos on contamination that the book seeks to stage and criticize. As in the previously quoted passage, the narrator pulls back from focalizing Bakha’s thought-world in order to name a problem, here the “six thousand years of racial and class superiority” oppressing him (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 16). The colonial military system becomes, for Bakha and his friends, the promissory re of a desired equality unattainable in the caste Hindu world. Indeed this cathexis of military equality, the narrator tells us, cuts across the lines of caste, so that “[t]he consciousness of every child was full of a desire to wear Western dress” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 101). Towards the end, the novel focalizes a Brahmin babu’s young son during a hockey match. The child wishes he too could take part and “wear shorts . . . And he would look like a real sahib because he was not so dark” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 114).
      </p>
<p>
	Bakha’s work on the British barracks puts him in contact with the white soldiers. “The Tommies had treated him as a human being and he had learnt to think of himself as superior to his fellow-outcastes” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). This non-sequitur asks to be read as a species of anacoluthon—a particular type of shift in rhetorical register, or a break in the expectations set up by a syntactical or semantic pattern. Universalist equality (“human being”) is conjoined with hierarchical ranking (“superior”). The conjunction “and” suggests a weak logical causality between the first and second sections of the sentence. Indeed, the particular and ironic quality of the anacoluthon in this case hinges on the coordinating conjunction. Rather than being deployed, as one expects, to articulate two <span style="font-style:italic;">equal</span> units, the coordinator “and” is here itself used to signify a logical hierarchy (in the manner of an “if—then” construction). Bakha feels superior because he is treated as a human being. In the ideology of liberal humanism, the feeling of superiority to other human beings is not supposed to be the consequence of being treated like a human being. This semantic and logical abyss warns the reader from the very outset that the colonial promise of universalism is a lie, and is not a viable solution to the predicament of untouchability. A good part of the novel is spent in unraveling this particular double bind through the narrative construction of Bakha’s subjectivity.
      </p>
<p>
	The lesson of colonialism is thus presented from the novel’s opening page as profoundly paradoxical: it is a matter of both equality <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> superiority. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> anticipates what historian Partha Chatterjee will later call the “rule of colonial difference,” the production of the colony as the “exception” which paradoxically vindicates the metropolitan’s own theory of itself as a representation of the universal.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Bakha can only join this “universal”—become a human being—by reimposing a law of hierarchical difference upon the other untouchables, by ratively taking the first step in becoming a colonial sub-oppressor.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The narrative does not stage Bakha taking the road of sub-oppression, but rather treats his “mimic man” tendency with pathos and humor.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> He accedes to an awakening consciousness of shared humanity as well as expressing contempt for the abjectness of his untouchable fellows. It is a real historical paradox that colonialism did have an emancipatory aspect for India’s lower castes, and the novel acknowledges this. But it also, from the start, writes in the aporia that the humanist expression of equality comprises when transposed into colonial space.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	This aporia is emblematized by Bakha himself, the bricoleur who pieces together a version of a British army uniform. Its “clear cut” lines and “stark simplicity” ring for him a desired superiority to the abjection of the untouchable’s world, something better than the “formless,” the “greasy,” the “dense,” the “thick,” the “discolored” and the “patched” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 10–13). Bakha’s colonial transvestism echoes and displaces that found in earlier literary works such as Rudyard Kipling’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Kim</span>  and Rabindranath Tagore’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Gora</span> . In <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> though, there is no commentary on the anglo-Indian hybrid as the real Indian, as there is in Kipling and Tagore. It is rather through the fantasmatic appearance of Gandhi at the very end of the novel that the <span style="font-style:italic;">non</span>-caste (the outcaste) will eventually be depicted as <span style="font-style:italic;">failing</span> to accede to national or representative Indian-ness, even as Gandhism alienates him from his identification with the whites. It is with the appearance of Gandhi that the novel’s knot connecting high imperial politics, diasporic activism, and the novelistic representation of subalternity will become clear.
      </p>
<p>
	But before this point, it is in the motif of Bakha’s transvestite attire that contact with the colonial army is depicted as bringing Bakha’s subalternity to crisis. The subalternity of the urban untouchable passes through the aporia in a particular way, and in so doing it overflows itself into another semiotic: clean cut military lines displace the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lumpen</span>, the rags and tatters, of subalternity. This is the point at which the novel depicts the colonially engendered possibility of human equality for the lowest castes in India based on a coding of the outward signs of the body. Colonialism as <span style="font-style:italic;">pharmakon</span>—both poison and cure—is acknowledged by the novel’s narrator, expressing the work’s powerful insight into the destabilization of the protagonist’s subaltern status: “He was a pioneer in his own way,” says the narrator of Bakha, “although he had never heard of that word, and was completely unconscious that it could be applied to him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 78).
      </p>
<p>
	The staging of Bakha’s admiring imitation of the British soldiers also articulates a haphazard parallel with the language of the novel itself, English. Right from the start of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, the novel’s English is ironized as a kind of self-defeating, transvestite medium, for the moment precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">un</span>-suited to the task of accessing and giving voice to subaltern consciousness and idiom. Indeed, Anand underlines this connection by dramatizing Bakha’s own desire to speak English: “he had felt a burning desire, while he was in the British barracks, to speak the <span style="font-style:italic;">tish-mish, tish-mish</span> which the Tommies spoke” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 39). The novel represents a displacement of the sound of English (the language in which it is written) as meaningless onomatopoeia, and thus as a lingual space as yet inaccessible to the very subaltern whose consciousness is being depicted in that language. The few pages around the “<span style="font-style:italic;">tish-mish</span>” quotation become a constellation of references to literacy, and the desire for it, and thus a cathexis of literacy (not simply of English) is also made a signifier of the crisis of subalternity (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 38–46).<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is part of what, in the space of a few years, would be the emergence of the second wave of Indo-Anglian fiction: <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> , R.K. Narayan’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Swami and Friends</span> , Anand’s own <span style="font-style:italic;">Coolie</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Two Leaves and a Bud</span> , and Raja Rao’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> , to name the best-known examples. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s imaginative relationship to the vernacular it mimes is deliberately awkward, wrenching,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> embarrassing: “You lover of your mother,” shrieks Bakha’s father; “You annoy me with your silence, you illegally begotten! You eater of dung and drinker of urine!”; “May the vessel of your life never float in the sea of existence,” yell two angry women of different caste and class positions at different moments (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 10, 25, 71). Anand could not have put “motherfucker” (i.e. what “lover of your mother” must more literally be intended to translate) into the mouths of his characters, but the many techniques he uses to render the vernacular make the reader painfully aware of the lack of fit between the various levels of street Hindi or Punjabi and English.
      </p>
<p>
	A digest of these fascinating techniques would include: insertion of untranslated fragments of Punjabi (“I don’t know what the <span style="font-style:italic;">kalijugs</span> of this age is coming to” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 48]); Punjabi sentences or phrases cited with translations in parentheses (“It is on account of this that the goras white men call them <span style="font-style:italic;">kala log zamin par hagne wala</span> (black man, you who relieve yourself on the ground)” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 19]); literal translations of Punjabi (“<span style="font-style:italic;">why do you eat my head?</span>” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 32]); simulation of Punjabi syntax (“You sweepers have lifted your heads to the skies, nowadays” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 72]); explanatory footnotes (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">passim</span>); and mispronounced English words, such as “gentreman” for “gentleman” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 16). All of the above are set in a consistent extradiegetic narratorial voice written in “normal” English prose.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Indo-Anglian novels of this second, pre-independence wave have a complex variety of relationships to the various Indian languages they engage in English.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Both <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> and Rao’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> anticipate in different ways the spectacularly staged appropriation of English as an Indian(ized) language in G.V. Desani’s <span style="font-style:italic;">All about H. Hatterr</span> . But such an appropriation is not really the agenda of either of these two earlier, pre-independence novels. While <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> lovingly simulates the Kannada language as a lost object, miming its rhythms and syntax, <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> experiments with “bad” writing, with awkward stiltedness and interruption, to make vivid a problem of disarticulation between two languages and two spaces. Bakha’s thought-world, however, is represented in a language continuous with that of the narrator:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  He didn’t like his home, his street, his town, because he had been to work at the Tommies’ barracks, and obtained glimpses of another world, strange and beautiful; he had grown out of his native shoes into the ammunition boots that he had secured as a gift.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 78)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  This quasi-prosopopeic narration of states of affect and thought is perhaps another gesture toward the paradoxical (un-)representability of a shared humanity under colonial conditions.
	</p>
<p>
	  It is at the level of the imagery and philosophy of the subaltern orality of gossip and rumor that the novel presents a different kind of discursive discontinuity with such apparently smooth representations of consciousness. At a crucial moment in the narrative, to which we return in the final sections of this essay, the novel breaks with the continuity between the narrator’s voice and the language used to represent Bakha’s thought world. In the other awkward experiments with idiom, <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> depicts the transnational medium of English as being inadequate to the task of reaching the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> subaltern. Thereby, the very vessel being used to carry the horrors of the colony to the heart of the metropolis is ironized, in a double bind which the novel’s closing scenes will attempt to cut. It will be the task of the final pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> to show that Anglophile transvestism is, in fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> a way out of caste oppression, even as it is the sign of the crisis of subalternity.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Engaging Modernism</h1>
<p>
	  We have seen that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is neither addressed to the subaltern nor to a popular Indian readership, but is rather written in English so that it will speak to the metropolis. Moreover, it is an experiment with and on modernism. Its desire is both to “write back” the colony to the British metropolis’s exemplary modernist space, as the final paraph suggests, and to find an expression for the common humanity of India’s most marginal res. As Anand wrote in 1972, about himself and Raja Rao in the 1930s, “The English writing intelligentsia of India was . . . a kind of bridge trying to span, symbolically, the two worlds of the Ganga and the Thames through the novel . . . having to transcreate certain human beings into the as yet small third world of international men.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> It is a powerful, albeit gender-fixed, argument (though Raja Rao put the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> into the mouth of an elderly, Brahmin, female raconteur). In this 1970s lecture, Anand can invoke the “third world,” the post-Bandung image of a postcolonial international collectivity. He can there inscribe himself and Raja Rao—the other literary example of his essay—as the historically determined precursors of the humanism of Bandung’s third way internationalism. Yet before any available public image of the third world, Anand practiced a transgressive and eccentric modernist idiom in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, an idiom that perhaps occupies a more difficult place in the canons of “modernism” than the Joycean colonial modernism which was one of its most profound influences. The capital “U” of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is readable as an intertextual tribute to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>—both as a claim on it and an inscription within its discursive space of a re of the untouchable boy “Uka” (another “U,” and one of the res from which Bakha was elaborated). Uka had, in Anand’s words, been the subject of a “simple” and “austere” article by Gandhi in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Young India</span>, an article which perhaps provoked “a sudden fit of revulsion against my existence, in elitist Bloomsbury” (“Why,” 250).<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Moreover, Gandhi’s article/speech on Uka is quoted almost verbatim at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> as a representation of part of Gandhi’s speech to the crowd (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 146–7). “Uka” thus appears multiply displaced within the fiction of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> itself: as “Bakha,” as a re with whom Bakha identifies during the speech, and as an element of activist documentary reterritorialized and folded back into novel-prose.
	</p>
<p>
	  According to his own account, Anand had set out to transpose what he calls the “stream of consciousness” staged in <span style="font-style:italic;">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> into a different colonial context and into a subaltern re who would be “the very opposite of Joyce’s” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 23; 21). Anand attempted to translate Joyce’s deconstructive intervention within novelistic representation into a voiced restitution of a fragmented  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> subalternity: “I would rescue from the obscure slums of the British Indian cantonment, a man of real flesh and blood . . . I would include all the contradictions of his temperament” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 22). The desire is to show and voice (to focalize) the colonial everyday— “the hell . . . the truth of his subhuman life” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 23)—not from the position of the colonist, nor from the position of the caste Hindu, but from the “contradictory” and inherently multi-voiced, textualized place of subalternity: “reminiscence, instinctive awareness, and intuition indicated in certain phrases, symbolic words and truncated thoughts” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 23). The positions of colonial English or caste Hindu are representable as having “contradictions,” too, of course, but Anand’s position is that in fact the subaltern is usually denied this complexity if, indeed, it enters literary representation at all.
	</p>
<p>
	  An Indian <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> could not be written, and to explore the reasons for this would take us too far afield.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> It must be noted that Anand does not simply transpose aspects of Joyce’s technique back into a more obviously “realist” idiom, but hybridizes at both ends. These paradoxes are reflected in the technical dilemmas Anand had writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>. His report of the historic visit to Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram in 1927 contains a passage describing how his overwrought novelistic discourse is criticized, and then, after a rewrite, validated, by Gandhi himself. On arrival at Sabarmati, Anand showed Gandhi the extant manuscript. As Anand reports Gandhi’s words, “The next day he told me, ‘I have looked at your novel. You seem to use big words. Harijans sigh, moan, groan! They do not use such heavy words. Write in a simpler language and transliterate what they say.’”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> This marks the symbolic passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s being an “artificially concocted” work to its being one of “sincerity” (“Why,” 250–1). Gandhi instructs Anand to align the ventriloquist desire for prosopopeia to a more correct mimesis, to voice the subaltern with more accuracy. We have seen the interesting results of this effort as far as the novel’s language goes, where the attempt, in “translation,” to produce a more “realist”-type mimesis of the object imposes “bad” writing, jarring interruption, and reflection on the matter of representation. Any simplistic opposition between “modernism” and “realism” is called into question here, as a consequence of the attempt to capture colonial subalternity in a literary representation. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s ending will register yet another level of subaltern discourse, and, perhaps not coincidentally, introduce a powerful representation of Gandhi himself.

<h1 class="sec-headA">The Progressive Writers’ Association</h1>
<p>
	  While <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> was being written “to” London, a group of radicalized Indian graduate students <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> London was meeting to discuss the possibility of an activist writers’ association for India. Mulk Raj Anand was key among their number. These meetings, and the subsequent organizational activities, laid the groundwork for the formation of the PWA, which held its first conference in Lucknow in 1936. An association explicitly aligned with the Third International’s 1935 project of a Popular Front, the PWA was conceived at the start as part of an internationally articulated cultural movement  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> against fascism. Its locus of operation was primarily in the domain of culture, broadly conceived at the national level, and practically split into regional and linguistic units. The PWA considered the national level of cultural work to be a metonymic part of an international whole, though its early programmatic statements are almost exclusively concerned with national and regional questions.
	</p>
<p>
	  The PWA worked on many fronts, and arguably came into its own in the 1940s with its experiments at the level of popular culture, in cinema and with the Indian Peoples’ Theatre Association (IPTA). As Gayatri Spivak has said of the IPTA’s performances during the Bengal Famine of 1943, “They took performance as the medium of protest . . . What they were performing was the famine and how to organize against it . . . A relationship between aesthetics and politics was being deployed by people who were taking advantage of the fact that aesthetics had been officially defined as autonomous by colonial ideology . . . using the enemy’s definition of aesthetics as having an autonomous sphere and sabotaging that in order to bring back the relationship between aesthetics and politics in a very direct way.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> It is arguable that a work such as Anand’s, which takes transgressive colonial material and tries to make it legible within the colonial definition of an aesthetic sphere, helped pave the way for the IPTA’s more activist deployment of aesthetic autonomy. E.M. Forster cannily acknowledges Anand’s claim to occupy an aesthetic, and therefore “clean,” territory in his preface to the first edition. Forster, trying to forestall the reader’s revulsion at a novel about shit, writes that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> has “gone straight to the heart of its subject and purified it” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, v). For Forster, literal excrement – the novel’s most shocking motif – is not the same as aesthetic impurity or morally reprehensible “filthiness” in representations. An intervention such as that by the IPTA had thus been enabled by the early PWA’s general project of, in the words of Sajjad Zaheer, a PWA founder, “<span style="font-style:italic;">creating</span> [the] <span style="font-style:italic;">conditions</span> for our writers which would help them in their work . . . a suitable <span style="font-style:italic;">milieu</span> was to be created for the new literature of India to grow and to flourish.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Anand’s work cannot occupy the more directly activist space claimed by IPTA performance, but by breaching new kinds of matter for representation it helps to enable the staging of the “aesthetic” as a site of the “political.”
	</p>
<p>
	  In the India of the mid-1930s, the PWA’s culturalist Popular Front anti-fascism was necessarily inflected by anti-imperialism, and Indian intellectuals such as Anand were among the first to perceive at first hand the connection between fascism and imperialism. Anand wrote in 1939, “[W]e saw the ugly face of Fascism in our country earlier than the writers of the European country, for it was British Imperialism which perfected the method of the concentration camp, torture and bombing for police purposes.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> By his own account, Anand seems to have made this connection between fascism and imperialism while in England through his experience of the suppression of the 1926 General Strike which “reminded me of the Seven Stripes I had got in the Martial Law days in Amritsar.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Here I focus on only one aspect of the PWA’s activity during the formative early years. An important feature of the early PWA project is its mission to prepare a new kind of national readership—a new “public” subject for the new literature. The PWA’s amorphous collective endeavor did not attempt solely to think about the making of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> new literary forms. Besides a new kind of art, one that will be written “in the language of the ordinary people” as Premchand put it in 1936, we need, he says, to create “a new atmosphere,” a new space in which to “prepare” to write.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1939, looking back on the first few years of the PWA’s activity, Anand will write of “the popularization of culture,” registering a necessary educative dimension of the organization’s work going beyond literary innovation, techniques of mass contact, or mere distribution. “The latent genius of the masses enslaved for thousands of years will, through education, enlightenment, and the organization of that enlightenment, liberate our nation.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> This is put in the language of its day, but it points to a question that has not gone away. The PWA clearly recognized the problem (later developed by res such as Frantz Fanon and Amilcar Cabral) of its own educative relationship to the “people” and “masses” it wished to touch.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> For Aamir Mufti, the stake of realism as it was transposed to India by the PWA amounted to more than “telling the truth of society in fiction,” as it took on the task of “narrating the emergence” of the consciousness of an “abstract and secular citizen-subject.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> “National realism,” as it is now termed by Mufti, turns upon the didactic endeavor of “narrating the (national) passage from primitivism to modernity,” and in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> the “totality that is the nation is concretized as the formal tension between the universalist and secular consciousness of the narrator and the subaltern protagonist Bakha” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EC</span>, 184). The colonial “realist” novel appears in this argument as an allegory of a specifically nationalist vanguardism. While the contours of the 1930s “realist novel” are indeed re-shaped by their transposition to a colonial context, I am less sure that this particular novel’s “object” is a “secular nationalist consciousness” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EC</span>, 183). As I will show, Anand rather pursues his ironic and circuitous strategy of writing in English so as to open up a space where the prevailing representations of a national popular subject (from both the PWA and the Gandhian movement) may be guarded against a premature collapse into representations of the popular as a “secular nationalist consciousness.” This is surely why <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is focused on a subaltern re in crisis.
	</p>
<p>
	  The “people” spoken of by the early PWA are by definition imagined as being above the level of the subaltern. If the PWA conceived its new audience at the level of a national (though regionally differentiated) “people,” Anand’s focus on a subaltern-re-in-crisis for his first novel becomes particularly interesting. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s Bakha represents, as it were, the subaltern as potential “people,” as becoming-people, not-quite people, public-to-come. He is separated by “an insuperable barrier . . . the barrier of caste,” from the novel’s image of the people—“the crowd” that gathers to see Gandhi in a counter-public nationalist manifestation (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 137). In considering the PWA, we must add to this caste “barrier” the question of class separation (which is also the invisible line between Bakha and the novel’s narrator), a line that intersects at a jagged and discontinuous tangent with that of caste.
	</p>
<p>
	  These were vital issues for the emergent PWA. How will we touch or create a public? This question sounds through the key statements of the PWA in the pre-independence years. Again, by potential public the PWA does not quite have the subaltern in mind. Anand’s novel, focused as it is on the subaltern, is thus written at a peculiar tangent to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the desires of the PWA which he led in its first few years. One of the key points in this regard, returned to again and again by the spokespeople of the PWA, is the necessity of inserting literary practice into continuity with the culture at large. Literature has been lagging too far behind:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    It has tried to find a refuge from reality . . . it has produced a rigid formalism and perverse ideology . . . It is the object of our association to rescue literature and other arts from the priestly, academic and decadent classes in whose hands they have degenerated so long; to bring the arts into the closest touch with the people; and to make them the vital organ which will register the actualities of life, as well as lead us to the future.

<p class="continued">
	  This passage is from the first version of the manifesto published by the PWA in London’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Left Review</span> in February 1935.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> In its ambition to transgress, for example, contemporary Indian literature’s “furtive and sentimental attitude towards sex” and to “deal with the basic problems of our existence to-day,” the PWA demonstrates a desire to speak to a present from which it so far feels cut off.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> A central aspect of this effort to connect with a public-to-come is red by the language in which the effort to reach toward the popular imagination will be made. A “new standard of beauty,” to be written “in the language of ordinary people,” is demanded by Premchand at Lucknow.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> This means writing in all the various vernaculars of India: “We want associations to be established in each province and in each language which will be able to spread our message in every language,” he continues. Some of the practical measures thought of by the PWA for this project of “education, enlightenment, and the organization of that enlightenment” are detailed in Anand’s 1939 speech: bookshops, libraries in the rural towns, literacy campaigns, the writing of new school textbooks, a two-pronged national/regional approach to languages, promotion of a national “Indo-Roman” script, and interventions in film and radio.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, and all of Anand’s early novels for that matter, are necessarily discontinuous with the practical effort of the formative PWA as I have just outlined it. The Indo-Anglian novel was never a part of the popular culture of the subcontinent, and it remains restricted to a small, generally elite indigenous readership, overlapping with a larger foreign one. Its relationship to the <span style="font-style:italic;">popular</span> imagining of the national can only be slight and tangential, and it does not touch a subaltern readership at all. In a letter concerning the reprinting of <span style="font-style:italic;">Coolie</span> over twenty years later, Anand showed a realistic assessment of the kind of readership his novels reached: “Indian doctors in the U.K., the young sons and daughters of the working class of India in the U.K., and the ex-colonials.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1933 he was writing to the colonials themselves—to Bloomsbury in particular, perhaps—as well as to the few Indian students, professionals and civil servants in the U.K. The “sons and daughters of the working class of India in the U.K.” had not yet arrived on the scene, and Anand wanted rather to “show the concave mirror to Western intellectuals” who mostly seemed overly sanguine about their own complicity with imperialism.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  However, in a moving 1967 article about the writing of the novel, he also speaks of composing <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> out of a “guilt” and an obsession with the “abjectness” of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> subaltern.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Anand discusses the way the text of this writer’s life is interwoven with the text of the life of the subaltern: a particular childhood acquaintance is said to be the model for the novel’s re of “tragedy,” or the “negative hero” whom Anand tries to capture in Bakha (“White,” 5, 15). “I wanted to bring to light the ghosts of the ‘dead souls’ . . . I wanted to beckon all the phantoms, so that they should haunt the dreams of the half dead” writes Anand of the prosopopeic impulse to capture the elusive subaltern re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>. My point here is that Anand’s desire to approach the subaltern is a strange and errant intervention, through an experiment on modernism, which supplements the PWA’s project of creating a popular art without participating in that project. It is as if the distance of English makes it possible, in 1933/1935 to write of the very subaltern re which underlies the “people” and the “mass” that constituted the imagined subjects of the PWA’s interventions.
	</p>
<p>
	  It is clear, finally, that literary production in English was not a viable facet of the project of the PWA. The PWA necessarily emphasized the use of regional Indian languages as the instrument with which imaginatively to reach and reactivate a <span style="font-style:italic;">popular</span> imagination. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> does speak to the thorny dilemma of the representation and changing of a subaltern episteme, offering a remote and tangential commentary on the early PWA’s broadest transformative and popularizing ambitions of mass contact. The novel’s paradox is that it does this in a strategically altered English, which adds an extra twist to the torsion generated by its—necessarily but generatively failed—attempt to touch the slippery untouchable re.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Representations of Gandhi in the Subaltern Imagination</h1>
<p>
	  One of the most extraordinary moments in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> comes near the end, as Bakha attaches himself to a huge crowd that has gathered to see Gandhi. Until this point, miming in miniature the depiction of Leo Bloom’s day (with all its other times and spaces folded in) in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, the novel has tracked Bakha, through a single day in his life in a medium-sized north Indian town. All body and little mind, for most of the novel Bakha is the re of a sleeping giant. He signifies a massive physical potentiality constrained by the cruel workings of a millennially ancient caste system. The untouchable represents the foundation of strength holding up the delicate temple of the upper castes. Anand transforms this symbolic and deeply sedimented ration of the untouchable, rendering Bakha as a muscular proletarian body in the terms of Socialist Realism. Here is a description of Bakha cleaning up excrement, taken from <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s very first pages:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    He worked away earnestly, quickly, without loss of effort. Brisk, yet steady, his capacity for active application to the task he had in hand seemed to flow like constant water from a natural spring. Each muscle of his body, hard as a rock when it came into play, seemed to shine forth like glass. He must have had immense pent-up resources lying deep, deep in his body, for as he rushed along with considerable skill and alacrity from one doorless latrine to another, cleaning, brushing, pouring phenoil, he seemed as easy as a wave sailing away on a deep-bedded river.
	  </p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Bakha is not of course depicted as utterly mindless, as the narrator expends a fair effort in tracking the movements of his consciousness and subjectivity. As I have already shown, the narrator’s voice, the Socialist Realist voice perhaps, attaches the adjective “unconscious” to him on several key occasions in order to mark the severe limits of that consciousness. In such passages, Bakha is the re of a class, of a power, as yet unconscious of itself, struggling with its own unfocused sense of injustice: “there was a futility written on his face . . . in the highest moment of his strength, the slave in him asserted itself, and he lapsed back, wild with torture, biting his lips, ruminating his grievances” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 65). The transvestite imitation of the soldiers is the flipside of this crisis, the point at which the crisis has led to a displacement in the signs of subalternity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As the novel draws to a close however, the pattern it has established for the representation of Bakha’s thought-world is interrupted. Coincident with the imminent arrival of Gandhi on the stage, the register of his depicted thought-world shifts drastically. This is the most important point at which what V.N. Vološinov calls “interference” takes place: the “interferential merging of two differently oriented speech acts.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Here is the extraordinary passage (the emphases and parenthetic internal glosses are all in the original):

People said he was a saint, that he was an <span style="font-style:italic;">avatar</span> (incarnation) of the gods Vishnu and Krishna.

That was said to be a warning to the sahibs to depart from Hindustan, since God Almighty himself had sent a message to a little insect that Gandhi was to be the Maharaja of the whole of Hindustan. That the spider’s web appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lat Sahib’s kothi</span> (Viceroy’s residence) was surely significant.

<p class="continued">
		The quasi-mythic imagery of the subaltern imagination is here inseparably interwoven with the narrator’s voice by free indirect discourse, and can only enter representation at the cost of being a facet of the protagonist’s “unconscious” state. The logic of the imagery of the divine spider and the Gandhian saint pulls against the overwhelming rationalism and empiricism of the narrator’s voice so that the passage embodies a struggle between these two voices or “speech acts.” A page later comes a further account of a rumor about Gandhi in the outcaste colony. These moments are so surprising because for the first time the novel attempts to capture the texture and imagery of subaltern discourse in transgressive or insurgent mode. There has been no gossip of this kind presented in the novel yet, though we have seen many indices of the destabilization of sign-systems. Two of these indices are the novel’s own language in relation to Hindi or Punjabi and Bakha’s transvestism. Subaltern talk, as it has been represented until now has been functional, bantering, pathetic, but neither mythic nor militant. Except for the key theme of transvestism, it has not been articulated in res which attempt to approximate the movement of a subaltern imagination. Nor has it acceded to the impersonal scripting of rumor, here given in the ekphrastic emblem of an arachnid <span style="font-style:italic;">writing</span> a warning to the representative of the British sovereign.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		Historian Ranajit Guha has shown the fundamental importance of rumor to the practice of subaltern insurgency in colonial India. Yet Guha’s own outline of the practice of rumor separates it too cleanly from writing. “Rumor is spoken utterance <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>,” says Guha, “and speaking . . . differs from writing not merely in material . . . but in function.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Guha goes on to say, however, that “rumor is necessarily anonymous and its origin unknown” though “a fictive source may be assigned to it . . . its message cannot be authenticated by any reference to a source” and “the encoding and decoding of rumor are collapsed . . . at each point of its relay” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EAP</span>, 259–60). As Guha himself seems to imply, and as Spivak has explicitly suggested, it is more useful therefore to acknowledge the complicity of speech and writing as it determines the production of rumor. Writing, in the expanded sense of “text,” embraces or is folded-together (com-plicit) with speech.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Writing in the expanded sense <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> rumor according to Guha’s definition of it, inasmuch as it “will constitute a kind of machine that is in turn productive [and that will] continue to ‘act’ and be legible even if what is called the author of the writing no longer answers for what he has written.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> The “very structure of the written” is the “force of breaking with its context” that is echoed in Guha’s description of rumor as “anonymous . . . not sealed off by any ‘final signified’ emanating from a primal source . . . free form . . . plastic . . . transitive” (“Signature,” 317; <span style="font-style:italic;">EAP</span>, 261).
	      </p>
<p>
		It is in the depiction of the non-possessive, indeed non-human (it’s a <span style="font-style:italic;">spider</span>’s writing!), structure of writing, operated by the subaltern orality of a rumor-machine, that the novel finally opens onto a momentary imagining of the intricacy and complexity of a different philosophical and rative world. Such writings—in the narrow as well as the broad sense—were demonstrably a part of the insurgent subaltern discursive repertoire, for example during the Santal <span style="font-style:italic;">hul</span> (insurgency) of 1855:
	      </p>

<p class="continued">
		Anand takes up a motif for writing (the spider and its web) canonical in the “European” tradition from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Metamorphoses</span> onwards. In Anand’s own Bloomsbury context, the spider’s web had been renewed as a re for the delicate relation between fiction and the non-fictional in Virginia Woolf’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One’s Own</span> . It is one of the best-known quotes from the book: “fiction is like a spider’s web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Woolf here is delicately questioning the autonomy of art, and this may have provided an enabling model for Anand’s own practice. The novel may also be tracking the remote troping and permeation into the non-Hindu subaltern world of a celebrated motif from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Upanishads</span>: “The one God who covers himself with things, issuing from the primal source, from his own inherent nature, as a spider, with the threads—may procure us dissolution in <span style="font-style:italic;">brahman.</span>”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In the Upanishadic simile, the spider as spinning agent codes the agency of the non-phenomenal Absolute which inheres in all the scattered phenomenal threads, as Gandhi’s face appears in the web “in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lat Sahib’s</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">kothi.</span>” The writing spider traces the face and name of the Mahatma with its webby excretions, which in the popular imagination are its own feces (shit writing), taking on the role of the formless and inhuman agency of writing in the subaltern mindset as it is depicted by Anand. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s spider web passage is an ekphrastic image of the source of writing, located in a nonhuman agency and appearing at a moment of crisis. It is here—at the moment of greatest tension between the narrator’s discourse and the (collective) protagonists’ discourse—that the novel comes closest to “touching” the untouchable. It does this through the ekphrastic acknowledgment of the source of its own writability in a subaltern elsewhere: the writing of the abject untouchables’ rumored spider.
	      </p>
<p>
		The complex discursive world of subalternity appears fleetingly as an enigmatic and scattered offstage collectivity, like the strange collectivity of children who want to dress like white soldiers. The collectivity of rumor is, by definition, mobile, errant, indefinite, yet belonging to all. After the spider web passage, the novel goes into a dizzying sequence of other possible registers and permutations of the interweaving of spoken and written textualities. These include, as previously noted, passages from Gandhi’s published writings presented as parts of the speech he gives to the crowd, and a “babu” who “vomit[s] out” verbatim an article about Gandhi from the newspaper (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 138–153).
	      </p>
<p>
		This complex staging of the imagery and media of rumor is juxtaposed with the arrival on stage of Gandhi, who, like Napoleon III in Marx’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Eighteenth Brumaire</span>, interposes himself miraculously as the bearer of the collective consciousness otherwise scattered in rumor. Gandhi’s is the giant salvational face spun into the novel’s textuality: “Gandhi alone united him with them, in the mind, because Gandhi was in everybody’s mind” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 138). Gandhism expresses an affinity with subaltern consciousness, but acts to mobilize that consciousness within a thoroughly modernizing nationalist set-up. In Partha Chatterjee’s words, Gandhism made possible the indigenous peasantry’s “appropriation into the evolving structures of the Indian state” where they are “mobilized but do not participate” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NF</span>, 125). Marx had written of Napoleon III that,

The second Napoleon can play the role or “pretend to be” this man precisely because the legal-historical code will <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> allow the naturalness of the father-position to be questioned. The peasant faith in the miraculous leader as a natural father, a belief determined by their own political and social history, is captured in the representational role-play of the new Napoleon and miraculated into a subaltern general will: “The political influence of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the small peasant proprietors is therefore ultimately expressed in the executive power subordinating society to itself” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SE</span>, 239).<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>
		One of Gandhi’s most popular nicknames was “Bapu,” father. In his book of letters to Gandhi, Anand addresses him as “Bapu,” which is a very homey and colloquial word, more like “dad” than the more formal “father.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Parentality is an important re of oppressive/benevolent authority in the context of colonial semi-feudalism in India, and is often articulated in the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic;">ma-baap</span>” (mother-father, or “parents”).<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> It is too simple to divide the <span style="font-style:italic;">ma</span>-function and the <span style="font-style:italic;">baap</span>-function simply along gender lines between the positions of benevolent support and care (<span style="font-style:italic;">ma</span>) and unquestionable authority and punishment (<span style="font-style:italic;">baap</span>). Nevertheless, the ideological coding of the father, or mother, or parent, not to speak of its position in the symbolic, is different than, but comparable to, that of the French patriarchal father in Marx. To write the story of “The Eighteenth Brumaire of Mahatma Gandhi” would be a formidable task, inappropriate to the limits of this essay. Partha Chatterjee has sketched the main lines within which such an analysis could be undertaken to include Gandhi’s bapu-function. And yet, in spite of the effectiveness of “the Gandhian ideology,” it is also true to say that in this period there was a counter-appropriation of the name of Gandhi by many of the very groups the official Gandhian movement wished to incorporate. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> juxtaposes the apparition of Gandhi (as a fatherly representative of the absent collectivity of the untouchables) with the spider of rumor and gossip. The spider web, ring the face and the <span style="font-style:italic;">name</span> of Gandhi (“making a portrait of the sage, and writing his name under it”), registers the force of this subaltern borrowing of the name of the Mahatma. Just as Anand seeks to show connection and complicity between colony and metropolis, so does he suggest connection and complicity between the official, national “Gandhi” and the one written in the subaltern imagination. What is interesting about <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s articulation of this appropriation-as-representation is that the Gandhian discourse does not “take” in Bakha’s case. He neither accedes to militancy nor to an officially sanctioned Gandhian position. As we have seen, Bakha has, until this point in the novel, had a misfiring relationship to writing in the narrow sense. Like his transvestism, the desire for the ability to write and read marks a site of the crisis of subalternity, and the lack of literacy inaugurates the novel’s most obviously violent episode of caste prejudice against Bakha (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 46). <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> stages a tension between a general subaltern writing (exemplified as rumor and as the image of the spider writing) and the particular skills of literacy in the modern public sphere.
	      </p>
<p>
		The historians Shahid Amin and Gyan Pandey have in recent years shown the ways in which the re of Gandhi registered in subaltern discourses.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> already demonstrates a vivid awareness of this in the early 1930s. In spite of the Gandhians’ attempts to control the meaning of his name, ‘there was no single authorized version of the Mahatma.’ The slogans “Gandhiraja” (King Gandhi) and “Gandhi Swaraj” (Gandhi self-rule) were used to invoke a millennial or messianic arrival of a regime of justice in the present, a sense that current modes of authority had been miraculously suspended, or might be suspended if we took direct action now.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> The “historical traditions” of the Indian peasants and tribals messianically inscribed “Gandhi” into the re of a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> redemptive king, charismatic leader or saint (this may still be within the <span style="font-style:italic;">ma-baap</span> structure in many ways, but is often disarticulated from the Congress nationalist agenda in key respects). <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s narrator focalizes the mind of a peasant who “had heard from time to time . . . how a saint had arisen as great as Guru Nanak . . . the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ferungi Sarkar</span> (English Government) was very afraid . . . His wife wouldn’t be content with anything less than a touch of the Holy Man’s feet” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 139). In response to such reinscriptions of his name, Gandhi said that “none has authority to use my name save under my own writing.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> However, it was a notable feature of the Gandhian signature that it produced an extraordinary number of deviant countersignatories. Lochu Sabar, an aboriginal militant from West Bengal who fought in the campaigns of the 1930s and ‘40s, has reported that during this period the word “Gandhi” became a common name. Anyone could become Gandhi, any disturbance could herald the arrival of his kingdom, right now.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> The appropriation of Gandhi’s name by aboriginal and peasant activists was an attempt to call a just future into the present. On the one hand there was no presently existing Kingdom of Gandhi; yet for the subaltern it was an imminent reality. In this peculiar re-scripting of the name of Gandhi in the impersonal body of rumor, you could say that the subaltern had something in common with the project of a Progressive <span style="font-style:italic;">Writers</span>’ Association.
	      </p>
<p>
		In <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, Anand explores this commonality, as well as the persistent classcaste distance which hampers the institutionalization of such a commonality in a lasting political form. The shared dilemmas of progressive cultural activists and subaltern rumor-tellers do not come into contact with each other, a situation staged in the last few pages of the book when Bakha listens in on a conversation about equality between Iqbal Nath Sarshar, “the poet,” and Mr. R.N. Bashir, “Barrister-at-Law.” The position from the poet, which in the novel is made to win the argument, is a fantasmatic technicist solution to the problem of inequality. The “machine which clears dung” will displace the metonymic contamination of the sweeper caste, and equality will follow as a matter of course: “[t]hen the sweepers can be free from the stigma of untouchability and assume the dignity of status that is their right” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 155). The two speakers exit the scene before Bakha can engage their discussion further, and his occupying a clear position in relation to their debate is thereby withheld.
	      </p>
<p>
		The peculiar responsibility of Anand’s novel lies in its stark outlining of the problem of separation between progressive cultural activists and the subaltern spaces they wish to touch, with the “popular”—the Gandhian “crowd” and the “people” of the PWA—as a strange placeholder in between. The fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> does this in the English language is a paradox, as it thereby disconnects itself from the real literary tasks the PWA set itself even as it illuminates their problematic. It is as if the novel as performative text wishes to embody the very separation it thematizes, or to struggle, like Bakha, with the simultaneously alienating and enabling dress of the English. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Letters on India</span> of 1942, where Anand makes explicit his criticisms of the high politics of imperialism, he includes a dedication to “Tom.” Tom Brown is the fictional addressee of the letters, a re of a radicalized member of the British working class (and thus already a displacement of a prior literary re of nationalist, upper-class  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> English decency in the protagonist of the didactic <span style="font-style:italic;">Tom Brown’s Schooldays</span>). As if to write himself back into the space of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, Anand apologizes to the fictional Tom for the “queer, spidery handwriting” of the original letters.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>
		In “writing back” to Bloomsbury, Anand guards a particular re of what is untouchable: the formless, elusive, spidery source of his own writing, offering thereby a monitory warning about the distance between activism and the people in whose name it is acted out.

		  The novel’s final line, just above the paraph, reads “And he proceeded homewards” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 157). This refers to the untouchable protagonist in his north Indian town. The novel has already complicated what “home” could mean in this place, and the paraph opens the dimensions of this questioning further.

Nanette Hale and Tabish Khair (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanaeum Press, 2001), 34. As I have been arguing, this particular paratext is a quite important element for the reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>. Khozan and Lock suggest that the paraph expresses an embarrassing desire for approval from “Bloomsbury” on Anand’s part. “One is almost relieved,” they write, “to find that this line has been removed from the Indian paperback” . As I am trying to show, the paratextual paraph can be read otherwise.

		    I cite here the two best-known critiques of Anand. The first quotation is from Suresht Renjen Bald, “Politics of a Revolutionary Elite: A Study of Mulk Raj Anand’s Novels,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Asian Studies</span> 8:4 , 488; the following three quotations are from Arun P. Mukherjee, “The Exclusions of Postcolonial Theory and Mulk Raj Anand’s ‘Untouchable’: A Case Study,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Ariel</span> 22:3 : 38–43. Bald’s essay is a cold-war era red-baiting psychobiographical polemic which conflates the “heroes” of Anand’s novels with Anand himself. It offers no sense that Anand may be attempting to explore in literature the kinds of problems that Bald accuses Anand of symptomizing. Mukherjee’s essay targets a rapidly-institutionalizing postcolonial theory, faulting it for fetishizing “resistance” and “identity” and “overlooking collaboration” ; and, paradoxically, faulting Anand for <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> representing the resistance of the untouchable political movements of the 1930s, and for writing in a middle-class voice. My contention would be that Anand is trying to represent a subaltern everydayness which has not yet been able to access the upwardly-mobilizing power of the contemporary “untouchable  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> leadership.” This was surely the condition of the vast majority of untouchables in the 1930s, however much metropolitan radicalism may wish to celebrate the possibility of their “revolutionary violence” and “dissenting and angry voices” .

The essay’s argument is unfortunately marred by a presentist culturalism which compels it to conclude that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> prioritizes “knowing one’s culture . . . over knowing to read and write” . The possibility of agency in literacy is downplayed in favor of an unwarranted and identitarian reading of Bakha coming to “an awareness of his own Indianness” . In spite of this, the chapter does give a useful conspectus of the novel’s references to writing and reading, except for the key scene of the writing of Gandhi’s name by a spider which is the focus of the final section of my essay.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f18" href="#f18-text">18. </a>
		    Many critics have discussed Anand’s strategies of translation, mimesis, and so forth. Anand himself has written on this topic in “Pigeon Indian: Some Notes on Indian-English Writing,” <span style="font-style:italic;">World Literature Written in English</span> 21:2  325–36. Anand writes of attempting to preserve the memory of the other language(s) in English, in particular around the pattern of rhythm (330–33). A representative recent example of the discussion of these features of Anand’s writing may be found in B.R. Agrawal and Nutan Kulshrestha’s “Indian English Novelists’ Experimentations with Technique and Style: A Study of Anand’s Technical and Stylistic Devices,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mulk Raj Anand</span>, ed. B.R. Agrawal (New Delhi: Atlantic, 2006), 172–86. Like the vast majority of such criticism, the chapter tends toward the taxonomic and descriptive.

		    Gandhi’s article was published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Young India</span>, April 27, 1921. It was presented as a speech at an untouchable convention in Ahmedabad the same year. The Uka mentioned there, a servant in the Gandhi household when the Mahatma was a child, is a cleaner of latrines like Bakha. The re of Bakha also seems to have been elaborated from a complex series of identifications with and as untouchable res. However, I cannot here expand on the profoundly complex relation between autobiography and fiction in this novel.
