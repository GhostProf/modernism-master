Liberal in its constitution, [Austria] was administered clerically. The
government was clerical, but everyday life was liberal. All citizens
were equal before the law, but not everyone was a citizen. There was
a Parliament, which asserted its freedom so forcefully that it was
usually kept shut; there was also an Emergency Powers Act that enabled
the government to get along without Parliament, but then, when everyone
had happily settled for absolutism, the Crown decreed that it was time
to go back to parliamentary rule.

<p>
Gabriele von B&uuml;low, for whom I was named, was the daughter of the
great Prussian nineteenth-century language philosopher and humanist
Wilhelm von Humboldt; her uncle was the equally renowned naturalist
Alexander von Humboldt. She herself, married to a diplomat and
statesman, was a prolific writer, known today mostly for her extensive
correspondence. Not only is Humboldt University in Berlin named for her
father; there is also a Gabriele-von-B&uuml;low Oberschule in Berlin.

<p>
But what did I, the daughter of Maximilian Mintz, whose Viennese Jewish
family originally came from Galicia (Poland) and Russia, and Ilse
Sch&uuml;ller, both of whose Jewish grandfathers (Sigmund Sch&uuml;ller
and Emil Rosenthal) were textile manufacturers, the former in Br&uuml;nn
(Brno), the latter in Hohenems (near the Swiss border), have to do with
the Prussian aristocracy? Why, for that matter, was my father named for
the late-fifteenth-century Hapsburg Emperor, Kaiser Maximilian I?

<p>
No doubt Gabriele von B&uuml;low appealed to my parents&#8212;and
especially to my mother&#8212;as an intellectual woman, even as
Gabriele's father was admired as a link to Goethe, whose work
von Humboldt disseminated, and Goethe was, for my parents, the
Great Writer and Thinker of the Modern, as opposed to the Ancient,
World. It is difficult for Americans to understand the thirst for culture
(<i>Kulturdrang</i>) of the Viennese Jewish assimilated, if not actually
baptized, upper bourgeoisie&#8212;a <i>Kulturdrang</i> that began with the
"Emancipation" of 1867. Kaiser Franz Josef promulgated a new constitution
that guaranteed freedom of religion and civil rights for all people of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, thus paving the way for the right of Jews to own
property, attend public schools, and enter most of the professions. The
Austrian Jews' extraordinary success following Emancipation&#8212;a
success always shadowed by the widespread anti-Semitism of the empire,
was to come to an abrupt halt with the German <i>Anschluss</i> of Austria
in March 1938. But even in their new homes in New York or Los Angeles,
S&atilde;o Paulo or Sydney, those refugees that managed to escape the
Nazis continued to be attracted to Viennese culture, with its ideals
of <i>Bildung</i>, <i>Wissenschaft</i>, taste, and connoisseurship in
the arts. My own parents and grandparents, settled in Riverdale&#8212;a
name, they were pleased to note, much more respectable than the Bronx of
which it is a part&#8212;continued to speak warmly of the Vienna Opera
or the Kunsthistorisches Museum or the Burgtheater as cultural sites
unrivalled in America, even as <i>Dobostorte</i> and <i>Palatschinken</i>
(crepes)&#8212;those desserts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire&#8212;were
judged to be unarguably superior to such counterparts as Apple Brown
Betty, custard and&#8212;worst of all&#8212;Jell-O, a dessert judged by
the Viennese refugees in New York to be, quite simply, not fit to eat!

<p>
The question of Viennese <i>Kultur</i> is still very much with us, even
though the world of the Dual Monarchy, known affectionately as <i>k und
k</i> (for <i>kaiserlich und k&ouml;niglich</i>, imperial and royal),
collapsed almost a hundred years ago, a casualty of the Great War. In
Los Angeles, where my husband and I have lived for the past twenty-five
years, German and Austrian refugee culture played a decisive role in the
late 1930s and 1940s. The composer Arnold Schoenberg had settled here
by 1934; the writers Thomas Mann, Bertold Brecht, Lion Feuchtwanger,
and Theodor Adorno followed in the early 1940s, all four settling in
Pacific Palisades, not far, as it happens, from my own

<b></b>

house on Amalfi Drive. Evidently the German and Austrian
&eacute;migr&eacute;s were drawn to the Palisades because the hilly,
wooded terrain, with vistas of the ocean, reminded them of their beloved
Italian Riviera; indeed the area is now called the Riviera, and the street
names, like Amalfi Drive, are all Italian: Capri, Sorrento, San Remo,
Napoli&#8212;even the improbable Ravoli (for <i>Ravioli</i>?), which
is around the corner. The former Feuchtwanger home, the spectacular
Villa Aurora, close to the Pacific at the foot of the Palisades,
is now the Foundation for European-American Relations, funded by the
German government through the Goethe Institute and designed to foster
understanding of new developments in literature and art as well as to
commemorate the great achievements of exile culture. On the lovely Spanish
patio of the Villa Aurora, one can observe&#8212;after the lecture or
concert&#8212;an interesting m&eacute;lange of aging &eacute;migr&eacute;s
and young German artists and writers nibbling on little finger sandwiches
(<i>Br&ouml;tchen</i>) and sipping white wine.

<p>
After the war, Mann, Brecht, and Adorno, among others, returned to Europe;
they had, after all, never become acclimated to an America they had found,
especially in its Hollywood incarnation, wholly inimical to a meaningful
cultural and literary development. Schoenberg, like such Austrian film
directors as Fritz Lang, remained; the composer wrote some of his major
works like <i>A Survivor of Warsaw</i> here in his Brentwood home. But
to what extent has his oeuvre been absorbed into American musical
culture? And what does such absorption really signify? As someone whose
"real" identity was once that of Gabriele Mintz, I cannot help but think
about these questions.

<p>
Indeed, the reception of Schoenberg's work in America provides an
interesting paradigm of the contradictions of cultural dissemination as
I have come to know them. A baptized Austrian Jew (later reconverted to
Judaism), Schoenberg was teaching at the Prussian Academy in Berlin when
Hitler assumed power in 1933.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 He fled to the United States, taking up residence in Los Angeles, where
 he spent the last seventeen years of his life. "I still remember,"
 the composer later wrote about his Vienna years, "a man saying with
 authority about me: 'And if he were Mozart himself he must get out.'"
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 In Los Angeles, he taught first at the University of Southern California
 (USC), then at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and
 influenced a whole generation of American composers including John
 Cage, whose Schoenberg stories are legendary. He never set foot in
 Europe again.

<p>
After his death, Schoenberg's family donated his extraordinary
estate&#8212;an archive consisting of major scores and manuscripts, visual
works, letters, and Schoenberg's entire library&#8212;to USC, where the
Schoenberg Institute opened in a small modernist structure in 1975: the
university paid about $500,000 for the building and $300,000 annually
for maintenance and concert activities. When I accepted a chair in the
USC English Department in 1977, the Institute was a major attraction
for me. Under the directorship of Leonard Stein, one of Schoenberg's
most accomplished pupils, it organized concerts, sponsored a journal,
and had excellent small exhibitions of the composer's manuscripts, his
Expressionist paintings, and his correspondence with various artists and
writers. At the entrance, there was a charming replica of Schoenberg's
study on Rockingham Road.

<b></b>

<p>
But although Schoenberg had developed a devoted following in the Los
Angeles of the war years and had had his orchestral works performed under
the direction of Otto Klemperer and Leopold Stokowski, he remained, in
the eyes of the musical public, an "esoteric," largely incomprehensible
composer. It is emblematic that when, after his retirement in 1946 from
UCLA, Schoenberg applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship so as to finish
his great opera <i>Moses and Aaron</i>, he was turned down. At the new
USC Schoenberg Institute, concert attendance was low, and the university
trustees evidently wanted "more bang for the buck," as one administrator
put it. Specifically, the university wanted the Institute to add classroom
space and to broaden the repertoire away from Schoenberg so as to attract
a larger audience. The composer's sons, said to be "difficult" in USC
circles, finally became exasperated and decided to take their archive
elsewhere. But although various universities and institutions expressed
at least some interest, nowhere were sufficient funds forthcoming.

<p>
In 1998, accordingly, the Schoenbergs gave their father's archive
back to his birthplace. In Vienna, it was offered strong government
support&#8212;an unimaginable situation in the United States. The Austrian
government spent $4 million to turn a 6,500-square-foot space in the
Palais Fanto into a state-of-the-art research center, exhibition space
and concert hall. The government also agreed to continue to support the
Schoenberg Center "for the duration" with a budget of around $1 million
a year. The Center's director, Christian Meyer, declared that "Schoenberg
was the most important Austrian composer of the 20<sup>th</sup>  century,
and this is an invaluable opportunity for Austrians to have direct access
to an important aspect of their culture which they might not know as
well as they should."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps this "aspect of their culture" has remained shadowy to
the Austrians because of the amnesia of the Nazi years and their
aftermath. Still, one can only marvel at the Austrian government's
generosity and the taxpayers' willingness to support such a cause. The
Center (<a name="1" href="10.2perloff_res.html#1"> 1</a>)
is housed in the heart of Vienna's Old City, just across the
Schwarzenbergplatz from the <i>Musikverein</i>, the home of the Vienna
Philharmonic, and a short walk from the famous Vienna Conservatory
of Music.

<p>
Such proximity means that conductors like Zubin Mehta and Claudio Abbado
can drop in to look at manuscripts of works they plan to conduct. The
Center immediately began a round of concerts, symposia, and special
events, and now sponsors fellowships, internships, and courses, as well
as a state-of-the-art website and computer projects whereby rare and
precious manuscripts are being digitized. The composer's own house on
the outskirts of Vienna in M&ouml;dling has also been reopened with a
permanent exhibition and lecture series.

<p>
After the difficulties the Schoenberg heirs experienced in Los Angeles,
they are evidently delighted with the new facility. Their negotiations
with the Austrian government, for example, included a private audience
with the Chancellor. Again, this would be unimaginable, not only in
the United States, but in most other nations, even small ones like
Austria. Nevertheless, I remain slightly skeptical. For however inspiring
it is to witness government sponsorship of a facility like the Schoenberg
Center, I can never quite forget that the Palais Fanto is just minutes
from the Rathaus, at whose sessions

<b></b>

of parliament J&ouml;rg Haider's neofascist Freedom Party has, at this
writing, sizable representation. And I recall that Ingeborg Bachmann,
who was born into a proto-Nazi family in Klagenfurt in 1926, remarked
frequently on the euphemism "the seven years" (<i>die Sieben Jahre</i>)as
a designator for World War II&#8212;a war in whose aftermath, Austria,
as an "occupied" country, escaped both the denazification campaign
undergone by Germany, and the Iron Curtain, which swallowed up all its
Eastern neighbors, including Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

<p>
Then, too, there is a personal irony for me in the idea that the new
Schoenberg Center should be housed in the Palais Fanto, to which I
have family ties. The Center website has this to say about the Palais's
original owner:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
David Fanto began his career as an apprentice for a paper shop in
Vienna. As a successful businessman he later bought oil fields in Galicia,
Rumania, and Poland. He founded one of the first Austrian refineries
in Pardubitz and participated in oil-drilling concerns in the Near
East. During the war years there was a sharp recession for the mineral
oil business.

<b></b>

In 1916 David Fanto bought Pottenbrunn Castle near St. P&ouml;lten. In
1917 he built the city palace (named after him) at Schwarzenbergplatz
6. After the war he was active in Czechoslovakia on behalf of the
restoration of the monarchy. David Fanto died in 1922. He left behind
two daughters, and a son, Richard Fanto, who inherited Pottenbrunn Castle.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Richard Fanto may have been the heir to his father's oil millions, but
his fate points to a very different side of Viennese <i>Kultur</i>. As a
wealthy young man, Richard Fanto had one consuming desire: to become
a professional cavalry officer in the most elite and exclusive of
regiments: Kaiser Franz Josef's own Yellow Dragoons. As my cousin Herbert
Sch&uuml;ller tells it in his unpublished family memoir, written in
English in 1995, Yellow Dragoons "wore red trousers, blue tunics with
yellow epaulettes . . . over which they had a shiny metal cuirass, or
breastplate, and a strangely curved helmet." For a young man of Jewish
descent, even a baptized and practicing Catholic as was Richard Fanto,
to become a member of the Yellow Dragoons was all but impossible. But
David Fanto brought it off by arranging a marriage between his son and
the daughter of an impoverished field marshall, Baron Horsetzski. After
World War I, the Fanto fortune collapsed as did Richard's marriage, and
this once elegant dragoon, a brilliant horseman who had won countless
trophies, spent his days trying to manage his meager funds and playing
cards at the Jockey Club. His daughter Ina, who had been brought up in
a convent, was to become an ardent Nazi&#8212;a high official in the
<i>Bund Deutscher M&auml;dchen</i>.

<p>
Meanwhile David Fanto's younger daughter Lili, married to my
grandfather Richard Sch&uuml;ller's brother Hugo, a physician, had
a very different fate. A talented artist, whose 1908 painting of my
mother (at age four) hangs in my dining room today (<a name="2"
HREF="10.2perloff_res.html#2"> 2</a>), she spent the early
years of her marriage shuttling back and forth between Vienna and her
Paris studio.

<b></b>
<p>



Her sons Herbert and George were brought up almost entirely by
governesses. The outbreak of the war changed everything: Paris was
now out of bounds, and the forty-year-old Hugo was soon called to
military service, physicians being in short supply. Alone in Vienna,
Lili began an affair with a man named Herman Blau, who happened to be
married to Grandmama Erna Sch&uuml;ller's sister Hedi, thus putting my
grandmother between sister and sister-in-law. The double divorce that
split both families was naturally a great scandal. I can still remember
hearing, as a young girl, the story of the bitter 1918 court case,
when Lili Fanto Sch&uuml;ller, asked why she wanted to divorce Hugo,
replied that he was not very good in bed. Grandfather Sch&uuml;ller,
by then a leading government official, was so angry at this "vulgar"
comment that he evidently didn't speak to anyone for a whole day,
and, given the circumstances, Uncle Hugo won custody of both of his
sons. But the loss of the Fanto fortune and marriage to the much less
elegant and more transparently Jewish Herman Blau (even though he
changed his name to the more neutral Berndt upon marriage), led to
a series of business disasters. When the two escaped Hitler in 1939,
the fifty-six-year-old Lili became a seamstress in a garment factory in
Elmhurst, Long Island. For the next fifteen years or so she sewed belts
on the assembly line, while her husband Herman worked as a shipping
clerk. She lived to be 101, maintained, in large part, by the two sons,
Herbert and George, she had treated so cavalierly in their childhood. I
remember meeting her once at George's house in Washington in the 1960s:
she was very much the grande dame in black dress and pearls, even as
her brother Richard continued till he died to play the cavalry officer
and boast of his one-time acquaintance with the Hapsburgs.

<p>
So it seems strange to me to think that the Palais Fanto is now a
center for avant-garde music and home to the estate of one of the
greatest composers of the century, whose own later years were spent
in difficult exile in Los Angeles. And yet Vienna's acquisition
and promotion of the Schoenberg oeuvre, now known around the world,
has oddly spurred on the Angeleno musical establishment to take a new
look at the composer's work. A decade after USC gave up the Schoenberg
archive and UCLA crassly sold the naming rights for Schoenberg Hall to a
pop music executive, Los Angeles concert groups organized an elaborate
"Schoenberg Prism" (2001-02)&#8212;a six-month festival of concerts,
lectures, symposia&#8212;that succeeded in bringing the composer full
circle to his adopted home, even as the composer's name, in response to
a wave of protests from the UCLA faculty, was restored to Schoenberg Hall.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 As is so often the case in American cultural and artistic life, it
 was the "foreign" imprimatur that made the difference.

<p>
The current absorption in the Viennese arts is hardly limited to
music. In the summer of 2002, for example, as unlikely a spot as the
Berkshires in Western Massachusetts featured a five-museum event called
the Vienna Project: "Gustav Klimt Landscapes" (with side exhibits on the
architecture of Joseph Hoffmann and Otto Wagner, and one on the "Homes
of Wittgenstein") at the Clark Institute in Williamstown, "Prelude to a
Nightmare: Art, Politics and Hitler's Early Years in Vienna, 1906-13"
at the Williams College Museum of Art, "Uncommon Denominator: New Art
from Vienna" at MASS MoCA in North Adams, "Secession Graphic Art" at
the Berkshire Museum

<b></b>

in Pittsfield, and an exhibition of Lisbeth Zwerger's illustrations for
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i> at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge.

<p>
Why Vienna in Williamstown? In Pittsfield, Stockbridge, and North
Adams? The <i>New York Times</i> speculated that it is precisely the
paradox of Vienna that once again fascinates us.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 On the one hand, there is Vienna, the great imperial city, with its
 opulent, gorgeous, erotic painting and design; on the other, Hitler's
 Vienna (the title of Brigitte Hamann's book on which the Williams
 College Museum show is based),
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 whose housing was so substandard that young men, arriving to seek their
 fortune in the capital, often ended up, as did Hitler, in bedbug-ridden
 shelters that were breeding-grounds for violence and political
 upheaval. A second&#8212;more specifically artistic&#8212;tension
 is that between the curves, spirals, and heavy ornamentation of
 the Secession versus the austere modernism of the "Kundmanngasse,"
 the house Wittgenstein designed for his sister Margarete, in keeping
 with the verbal "purity" of the <i>Tractatus.</i> How does the second
 emerge from the first? Is it a case of continuity or reaction?

<p>
I wondered about these relationships on a recent trip to New York when
I had a chance to visit two new institutions that represent the tension
between fin de si&egrave;cle and high-tech Vienna. The former, the Neue
Galerie, is located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Eighty-sixth Street,
just three blocks below Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim and four above the
Metropolitan. Its home is a lavishly restored Beaux-Arts mansion (1912-14;
see <a name="3" href="10.2perloff_res.html#3"> 3</a>)
designed by Carrere and Hastings, the architects of the New York Public
Library. Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt III once lived here, but ironically the
building more recently belonged to YIVO, an organization devoted to the
study of Yiddish culture. The Neue Galerie itself was the brainchild of
the art dealer Serge Sabarsky, a refugee from the Nazis who had settled
in New York and opened a gallery on Madison Avenue, and the collector
Ronald S. Lauder, an heir to the Est&eacute;e Lauder cosmetic fortune. In
1957, Lauder had evidently used his bar mitzvah money to buy his first
drawing by Egon Schiele. A decade later, he met Sabarsky and together,
the two gradually assembled a superb collection of Schieles, Gustav
Klimts, and Oskar Kokoschkas, as well as exquisite Viennese furniture
and decorative art by Joseph Hoffmann, Otto Wagner, and Adolf Loos,
along with a fine&#8212;but less unusual&#8212;collection of German
Expressionist art. In 1986, after a stint at the Pentagon, Lauder was
named U.S. Ambassador to Austria and during his stay in Vienna, where
he was joined by Sabarsky, the collection took its final shape.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
Ascending the Grand Staircase and wandering through the beautiful
high-ceilinged rooms with their arresting Klimt portraits and the erotic
drawings of Schiele, I experienced a strange sensory overload. My parents'
generation had felt nothing but contempt for these artworks, dismissing
them as "decadent," not yet truly modern. But today, this self-consciously
decorative and opulent painting&#8212;especially the Klimt landscapes,
apparently composed with the help of the telescope and hence flattened out
to look oddly like Japanese screens&#8212;seems nothing if not up-to-date;
indeed, many of the new works at MASS MoCA can be traced to the work of
the pre-World War I era, produced, as that work was, in a moment when
Jewish culture played a major role in the Austrian arts as did the Czech,
Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, and Slav cultures

<b></b>

that animated the capital. The interdisciplinary connections of the
artworks in the Neue Galerie are also striking: the same ornament that
defines Secession furniture, china, and glassware is found in posters
and calling cards, opera programs and book covers.

<p>
On the lobby floor of the Neue Galerie, to the right of the entrance,
is the elegant Caf&eacute; Sabarsky. This brilliantly designed restaurant
alludes slyly and subtly to fin de si&egrave;cle Vienna without pretending
to replicate the real thing. Here is a description by a restaurant
reviewer named Janet Forman:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Run by Kurt Gutenbrunner, chef at New York's sophisticated Austrian
restaurant Walls&eacute;, the caf&eacute; is rife with sumptuous
details such as marble tables and reproductions of Adolph Loos's 1899
black-bent-wood chairs&#8212;on sale in the design shop for $900 each.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The menu reinvents such Viennese classics as open-face Trzesniewksi-style
sandwiches, <i>matjes</i> herring with egg and apple, chestnut soup
and cod strudel with Riesling <i>sauerkraut</i>. . . . Slide across a
banquette covered in extravagant 1912 floral textile overlooking the
most fashionable part of Fifth Avenue, place a voluptuous $6 Sacher
torte to your lips, and for an hour you can be the vamp Sally Bowles
or an enigmatic expressionist painter in libertine Berlin of the Golden
Twenties.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Note the slippage in which early modernist Vienna is equated with Weimar
Germany as seen through the lens of Christopher Isherwood. But it doesn't
really matter in the

<b></b>

case of this elegant stage set, which has, of course, little to do with
the historic caf&eacute;s of Vienna&#8212;the Griensteidl (<a name="4"
HREF="10.2perloff_res.html#4"> 4</a>), the Landtmann, the
Herrenhof, the Central&#8212;frequented daily by such important persons as
Freud and Alfred Adler, Hugo Hoffmansthal and Robert Musil, Karl Krauss
and Leon Trotsky. Note that, as the painting of the Griensteidl makes
clear, the turn-of-the-century Vienna caf&eacute; was a male enclave. For
its patrons, it was primarily a refuge from the unheated, hopelessly dingy
flats and furnished rooms where many of them lived due to Vienna's acute
housing shortage. One drank coffee (always served with a glass of water),
read the papers, played cards and chess, and chatted with friends.

<p>
The Caf&eacute; Sabarsky is thus largely simulation. Ours is not the
world of Arthur Schnitzler's <i>Der Weg ins Freie</i> (The Road into
the Open), that troubling saga of an anti-Semitic society in which the
aristocratic hero Georg von Wergethin repairs, night after night, to
his favorite caf&eacute;, where he engages his Jewish alter ego Heinrich
Bermann in discussions about art, philosophy, and culture.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 The Caf&eacute; Sabarsky caters, not to regulars whom the waiters know
 by name, but to tourists, art professionals, and a good number of
 Ladies Who Lunch&#8212;a clientele that must often wait on line for
 the better part of an hour to gain entrance. Authentic? When I once
 asked my mother and her sister Susi whether they used to frequent the
 <i>Kaffeehaus</i>, they became quite indignant. Never, they insisted,
 did they set foot in a caf&eacute;! They had better things to do
 with their time. What they really meant is that the few women who did
 frequent the caf&eacute;s were not the

<b></b>

right sort. Ladies from <i>einer guten Familie</i> ("a good family")were
not seen there. They preferred the <i>Konditorei</i> or pastry
shop&#8212;for example, Demel's or Sluka's&#8212;which, unlike the
caf&eacute;, was designed for ladies as well as gentlemen and served
gorgeous finger sandwiches and cakes. But the fact is that my mother
and aunts barely went to the Konditorei either: they were too busy with
their studies or household routine.

<p>
And there are other anomalies. Around the time that I was reading in the
papers about the elegant Adolf Loos chairs in the Caf&eacute; Sabarsky, I
came across Tina Walzer and Stephan Templ's <i>Unser Wien: "Ariesierung"
auf Oesterreichisch</i> (Our Vienna: "Aryanization" Austrian Style),
a minutely documented study of the appropriation of Viennese Jewish
property&#8212;whether businesses, hotels, art galleries, cinemas,
architectural monuments, museums, book shops, or cafes&#8212;by the
Nazis in the spring and summer of 1938.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 As their catalog "Topography of Theft" makes clear, the bulk of
 this property has remained in the hands of the appropriators (or
 their clients), and there has never been a true restitution to the
 dispossessed and their heirs. For each important caf&eacute;, for
 example, the authors list the original owner(s), the appropriator(s),
 and the caf&eacute;'s later fate. Thus Bela Waldmann and Marcus Klug,
 the owners of the Caf&eacute; Herrenhof (frequented by writers
 like Max Brod and Franz Werfel), were imprisoned the day of the
 <i>Anschluss</i> and the caf&eacute; became state property (<A
 NAME="5" href="10.2perloff_res.html#5"> 5</a>).

<b></b>

<p>



The Graben-Caf&eacute;, designed by Josef Hoffmann in 1928 and owned by
Hugo F&uuml;rst, was torn down. And the Caf&eacute; Raimund, across the
street from the <i>Volkstheater</i> and hence a rendezvous for directors
and actors, lost its most illustrious clientele when the Nazis pursued
such directors as Rudolf Beer and Egon Friedell, both of whom committed
suicide within weeks of the <i>Anschluss</i>.

<p>
Reading Walzer and Templ's grim catalogue of theft, I found myself,
perversely, all the more curious about the romanticcaf&eacute; cultureof
imperial Vienna. Nostalgia, the longing for a past that has never quite
existed, with its concomitant feelings of loss and displacement, is,
as Svetlana Boym has argued so tellingly in her book on the subject,
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 the inevitable by-product of exile. On a sunny Saturday, when
 my husband and I finally dined at the Caf&eacute; Sabarsky, the
 experience surpassed all expectations. One taste of the pea soup,
 bright green and sweet, with little bits of lobster floating on top,
 triggered a Proustian recollection: just such pea soup had been served
 at H&ouml;rlgasse 6, where I lived for the first six and a half years
 of my life. Again, the <i>Matjes</i> herring topped with thin slices
 of apple and red onion struck me as delicious beyond words, recalling
 summer vacations in the mountains of Seefeld. And the <i>Sachertorte</i>
 and <i>Dobostorte</i> which we sampled tasted precisely like the ones
 our cook Kati had made in Vienna. Seated at a little marble-top table
 on the Adolf Loos reproduction chair (replicas are for sale in the
 Design Shop) and sipping, first Schlumberger Cuv&eacute;e Klimt and
 then a m&eacute;lange, I was totally happy. Yet&#8212;and here is
 another irony&#8212;I have been back to Vienna four times during my
 adulthood and have never had a meal nearly as good in Vienna itself. But
 then service in Vienna today is a far cry from that of Schnitzler's
 Vienna. It tends to be brusque and rude, the dishes served by surly
 waiters (one immediately wonders if they are anti-Semitic), whereas
 the Caf&eacute; Sabarsky is all smiles, all around.

<p>
A visit to the Neue Galerie is thus a classic nostalgia trip. But the
Austrian government itself is aware of the need to go beyond the image
of early modernist Vienna, however beautiful and opulent its art work
and design. Indeed, in April 2002 a very different institution opened
its doors&#8212;this time on East Fifty-second Street between Fifth
and Madison Avenues&#8212;namely the Austrian Cultural Forum. This
astonishing structure of concrete, glass, and steel (<a name="6"
HREF="10.2perloff_res.html#6"> 6</a>) was designed by the
Austrian architect Raimund Abraham, who has lived in New York since the
early 1970s.

<p>
The Forum's brochure describes the building this way:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The body of the Forum tower tapers as it rises, complying with zoning
laws in levels that alternately step and slope. Glazed with dramatic
glass panels that seem to be in a state of constant suspension, the
forceful but mysterious image of the building has elicited comparisons
to dagger blades and guillotines, thermometers and metronomes, Easter
Island totems and pyramids of a future not yet imagined. The structure
consists of what Abraham has dubbed "three elementary towers" defined
by the extreme conditions of a site only 25 feet wide and 81 feet deep:
the Vertebra is the stair tower at the back of the site; the Core is
the central structural tower containing the Forum's functioning spaces
within a meticulously constructed, interrelated arrangement, and the
mask is the glass articulation of the street fa&ccedil;ade, punctuated
by a protruding, box-like volume that in fact accommodates an interior
program area with spectacular views.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>



The website for the Forum is itself a work of art: flash-art images
of the towers and their skylights, seen from both inside and outside,
in shades of white, gray, and black are intersected by aphorisms
taken from the writings of Freud or the avant-garde poet Ernst
Jandl, and abstract geometric forms&#8212;primarily black squares and
rectangles&#8212;traverse the field vertically while John Cagean sounds
are played continuously. On the left, a series of tiny parallel lines
(evidently modeled on the compressed floors) move vertically toward the
top of the screen where they intersect. When clicked, these lines

<b></b>

give way to words, providing information about the Forum's
activities&#8212;its calendar of avant-garde concerts, performances
of digital art and music, lectures, poetry readings&#8212;as well as a
display of the different floors and their role in the building.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
It is a state-of-the-art digital performance that provides a feast for
the eye and ear&#8212;the dream, perhaps, of a new Vienna for the New
Artist. But again it isn't that simple. For Abraham, born to a Catholic
family in the small Tyrolean town of Lienz in 1933 and growing up to the
sight and sound of the "iron sky" covered with airplanes dropping bombs,
the notion of death is never far away. In a November 2001 interview
reproduced on the website, he cites Adolf Loos's aphorism, "When you walk
through the woods and come upon a hole two feet wide, six feet long, and
six feet deep, you know that is architecture." "Death," he remarks, "has
to work, it must express itself and its meaning somehow just as do hope or
desire. Maybe it's a problem of a technocized, urban society that death
becomes very much removed from our lives. I grew up in a small town in
Austria where there were funerals all the time. It was part of life." For
that very reason, monuments, Abraham believes, don't work. "Think about
the fact that no Holocaust memorial ever succeeds in the end because no
monument can ever be more monumental than a concentration camp. . . . No
building can match the terrifying empty spaces of these original sites."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
Not long after Abraham gave this interview, he renounced his Austrian
citizenship to protest J&ouml;rg Haider's participation in the coalition
government. Here again, an image carefully created and polished to
remind the international world, and especially the United States, of the
great cultural heritage and relevance of tiny Austria and its capital,
is shadowed by the specter of a dark politics that never seems to quite
go away. By a curious coincidence, we remember, Fifty-second Street, now
graced by Abraham's brilliant fa&ccedil;ade, was also&#8212;this time,
west of Fifth Avenue&#8212;the site of W. H. Auden's famous war dirge,
"September 1, 1939":


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I sit in one of the dives
<br />
On Fifty-second Street
<br />
Uncertain and afraid
<br />
As the clever hopes expire
<br />
Of a low dishonest decade. . . .
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps we can read the Forum's "masked" tower structure as a kind
of unmasking of those "low dishonest decades" of midcentury. The
soaring glass fa&ccedil;ade prompts the viewer to pay homage to an
Austria-in-Manhattan that might mark a new turn.

<p>
Or at least I would like to see it that way. But in 1944, when I changed
my name from Gabriele (already Anglicized&#8212;or more accurately modeled
on the French form&#8212;by the addition of an <i>l</i>) to Marjorie,
as part of the process of becoming a U.S. citizen, I was wholly unaware
of such cultural niceties. I was a thirteen-year-old eighth grader, who
yearned only to be as American as possible. In my class at the Fieldston
School, which I had just entered on a full scholarship after seven years
of public school in the Bronx, the most popular girl was named Margie;
she also happened to be assigned to be my Big Sister in the new school. I
so much wanted to be like this Margie that I still

<b></b>

make my capital <i>M'</i>s oversize and round like her
"progressive-school" script. I disliked <i>Gabrielle</i> because
classmates and campmates always called me Gabby, a name, I'm afraid,
all too appropriate, as those who know me can attest. Then, too, a
<i>gaby</i> is defined in the dictionary as meaning "fool" or "idiot":
the word is now obsolete but one can find it in Victorian novels in
locutions like "Don't be such a gaby!" As for the name Gabrielle,
the children at my Bronx elementary school had been given to shouting,
"<i>Gayyy-briel,</i>blow your horn!"

<p>
Accordingly, when we took out our citizenship papers, I asked to become
Marjorie, Margie for short. I am surprised that my parents consented,
since they were quite strict and quite insistent on my retaining the
German language and reading German literature, but they did. And so
I took on the name then linked to Herman Wouk's Marjorie Morningstar
and to sitcom characters named Marge. After I turned forty, I found it
inappropriate to be called Margie, as in <i>My Little Margie</i>, and so,
around the time when we moved from Washington to Philadelphia in 1972,
I became Marjorie once and for all. I can now divide my friends into those
I've known long enough to be Margie and those for whom I am Marjorie. But
when I see the name in print even now, together with the name Perloff,
which is not my name but my husband's, there is always a moment where
I wonder who Marjorie Perloff is. It just doesn't look or sound like me.

<p>
When Charles Bernstein found out about my "real" name he wrote the
following poem:


<h3>

Gertrude and Ludwig's Bogus Adventure
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What does it all mean? Ludwig (Wittgenstein) and Gertrude (Stein) make a
seemingly odd couple, but, as I suggest in <i>Wittgenstein's Ladder</i>
and as Charles has noted in

<b></b>

<i>Content's Dream</i> and <i>My Way</i>, they share a concern for
the strangeness of ordinary language, an awareness that the slightest
syntactic shift or the replacement of a single word in a sentence can
change meaning radically.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Then too, both Ludwig and Gertrude were nonpracticing, secularized Jews
 (although Wittgenstein was baptized a Catholic at birth), assimilated
 enough to call into question particular Jewish practices. Both were
 homosexual and chose exile&#8212;he in Cambridge, she in Paris&#8212;at
 least in part so as to avoid scrutiny of their private lives. Both,
 moreover, received in their lifetime "plenty o' flack" (line 19) for
 their radical ideas and seemingly "non-sensical" writings. Theirs,
 like Schoenberg's, was a "notorious novelty" (line 6), one that took
 decades to understand and assimilate.

<p>
It thus makes sense for Gertrude and Ludwig to share an "adventure." But
the "bogus adventure" to which the poem alludes in the first few lines
was obscure to me until Charles himself explained that he had in mind a
Pete Hewitt film called <i>Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey</i> ,
in which the two boy heroes have to battle with cyborg versions of
themselves, created by an evil spirit who wants to destroy their heavy
metal band. In the course of their adventure, Bill and Ted undergo
terrible ordeals but because, as the film's predecessor, <i>Bill &amp;
Ted's Excellent Adventure,</i> details, the two boys know the secret of
the universe ("Be excellent to each other"), they are rewarded in the
end by being turned into "good" Bill and Ted robots who conquer their
evil twins and win the Battle of the Bands.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
I confess that I wouldn't have known these plots had I not looked them up
with my favorite internet search engine Google and then watched a rerun
or two on the cable channels. Science-fiction-film adventure stories
that deal with Martians, cyborgs, and heavy metal are not exactly part
of my discourse radius. And that, of course, probably gave Charles
his rationale. Billy's "bogus adventure" in which the "balloons /
Get marooned on the other side of the / Lunar landscape" immediately
introduces the idea of borders to cross&#8212;and in a "module" that's
"broke" to boot. Everything in this landscape seems out of kilter:
"Sally's joined the Moonies," "the strings are broken on the guitar,"
and although "the sachertorte tasted sweet," "the memory / burned in
the colon"&#8212;an allusion to the lines in John Ashbery's "'They Dream
Only of America,'" "This honey is delicious / though it burns the throat."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 The poem moves from the American pop culture of the sci-fi opening
 and the well-known 1950s ad for Chase &amp; Sanborn coffee ("The
 morning cup will keep that grippe away!") to Vienna, "cold at that
 time of year" (an allusion to the early March weather at the time of
 the <i>Anschluss</i>), and then into a kind of sinister dreamscape,
 in which coffee dissolves in waves of "sand," and the preventable
 grippe modulates into "Get a grip, get a grip, before / The Grippe
 gets you." And then the transformation of "picture" into "pitcher"
 and the "pitcher that pours" into the baseball pitcher, "Throwing the
 Ball, with never a catcher in sight," gives us a premonition of a dark
 future. Even the nursery-rhyme rhythms of the conclusion&#8212;"Never
 a catcher but sometimes a catch, or / A clinch or a clutch or a
 spoon"&#8212;are jarring, leading up, as they do, not to the cow
 jumping over the moon, as one might anticipate, but to what will be
 "plenty o' flack, 'till we meet / On this side of the tune."

<b></b>

<p>
Which side is that? "Gertrude and Ludwig's Bogus Adventure" was
prompted in part by a conversation I had with Charles about my escape,
with my family, from Vienna on the day after the <i>Anschluss</i>
(March 12, 1938). The adventure of Gabriele Mintz, his poem suggests
obliquely&#8212;an adventure that takes Gabriele from the Vienna of
Wittgenstein to the America of Gertrude Stein, had its own "bogus"
dimensions with respect to the pretensions and impersonations of the
cultural milieu in which it was rooted. Indeed, Charles's poem captures
the curious tension that has characterized my own "adventure," which took
me as a small child from the Vienna of <i>Sachertorte</i> and <i>Kaffee
mit Schlag</i> to an America of Chase &amp; Sanborn coffee, Pete Hewitt
adventure films, Moonies, and baseball&#8212;all those trappings of
Americana that my family dismissed as so much lowbrow entertainment for
the untutored masses.

<p>
But, in a further twist, the poem undercuts this image as well. Is the
perception of America as the land of pop and <i>schlock</i> accurate? In
that case, why does the "Bogus Adventure" also encompass the very
different America of a poet strongly influenced by Stein&#8212;namely,
Frank O'Hara, to whose "Memorial Day 1950" (written when O'Hara was only
twenty-four) Charles alludes obliquely in lines 8-10. In this elegiac
poem, which pays homage to Stein and Picasso, Apollinaire, and Rimbaud,
"collages or sprechstimme," O'Hara recalls his alienation from his
parents in the following surreal sequence:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Wasted child! I'll club you on the shins. I
<br />
wasn't surprised when the older people entered
<br />
my cheap hotel room and broke my guitar and my can
<br />
of blue paint.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, in a later turn toward artistic vocation, the poet says, "Look
at my room / Guitar strings hold up pictures. I don't need / a piano
to sing." Just so, we read in Charles's poem, "when / The strings are
broken on the guitar / You can always use it as a coffee table."

<p>
The pragmatism of this "solution" is very congenial to me. "Love," we read
in "Memorial Day 1950," "is first of all / a lesson in utility." But
becoming Marjorie was a complicated process, given that, for my
family, the new American world was indeed "the other side of the lunar
landscape." And the "adventure" I underwent is in one sense "bogus," in
that memory has transformed so much of what "happened" that there is now
no way to recover the "real" past. But, like many &eacute;migr&eacute;s,
I remain fascinated by the cultural, social, and artistic legacy of that
modernist Vienna, so much of whose energy seems to have been expended on
the desire to downplay the Jewish presence that had, ironically, done
so much to make Viennese culture the richly textured, complicated, and
supersubtle culture it was. Indeed, the <i>Kulturdrang</i>, especially
of the interwar years, seems to have gone hand in hand with a collective
desire for <i>passing</i>&#8212;passing as someone or something one
could never quite be&#8212;a desire that tragically ended only with the
acknowledgment of the Holocaust.

<p>
Or has it in fact ended? Even now, as we learn in the Neue Galerie,
nostalgia can be powerful. The <i>Sachertorte</i> was sweet . . .
