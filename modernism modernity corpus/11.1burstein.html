as a present memory. . . . Amongst the doctrines of Tl&#x000F6;n, none has
merited the scandalous reception accorded to materialism."

<p>
Lucas's compelling critique of archaeology's words for itself leads me
to ask two questions: 1. "Is what makes a word a word the fact that it's
being used as a word or the fact that it's shaped like a word?"
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
2. What's time to a pig?
<p>
The second question is the punch line to a joke: Guy walking down
a country road passes a farm. Farmer is standing underneath an apple
tree, holding up a large pig; said pig is eating apples from the tree's
branches. Guy asks the farmer what he's doing. Farmer replies, "My pig
likes apples. I'm giving him some help here." Guy says, "But doesn't
that take a lot of time?" Farmer says, "What's time to a pig?"
<p>
What the farmer means is "My pig has no sense of time. Your question
is therefore a silly one." The joke is a joke because it reorients the
subject of the question from the farmer to the pig&#x02014;we understand
time to be of concern to people, rather than farm animals; but the farmer,
an egalitarian sort, is there to remind us that while pigs are not people
too, they are part of history, and


<b></b>


indeed may be occupying it far more fruitfully, ahem, than
bipeds. Further, the fact that to a pig time means nothing is not only the
point but, insofar as it is (qua punch line) the trump card, a position
to be envied. The ostensible becomes a shell game (pig for farmer),
and the ontological gets to kick the epistemological (knowing about time
is mocked by time meaning nothing). At a further level, the ontological
becomes, as it were, brute fact: this is what the farmer means when he
chooses not to say "When's time to a pig?" The logical absurdity of giving
time shape, according it what-ness, is laid bare by virtue of colloquial
necessity. Humans can only speak to each other by making such mistakes.
<p>
The "'discovery' of prehistory" entailed, Lucas says, "the discovery of a
new method of understanding the past: the analysis of material culture"
. Lucas's central move thus links prehistory to ontology, which
he sees as the fallout of prioritizing "material culture before text"
. However, this form of privileging material culture ("in the
specific context of archaeology, material culture was to have the upper
hand" [111]) evinces the same limitations Lucas sees in the privileging
of history as narrative. Indeed, to apply Lucas's canny observation that
there is no difference between material culture as an object of scrutiny
and as a method (prehistory "blurs the distinction between method and
material" [111]), there is no difference between his understanding of an
object as a shape or a mark, and as a sign. Another way to put this is
to say that Lucas is torn between making plain "the radical project of
modernity" as an "attempt to put material culture on an independent basis
for understanding the past"  on the one hand and "highlight[ing] the
close relationship material culture has with textuality, or discursivity"
 on the other. Lucas does indeed see the relation as close; in fact
he confuses them. Proceeding on the assumption that material culture
involves a form of interpretation distinct from reading while at the
same time failing to distinguish between a mark and a word, he is bound
to both schism and conflation.
<p>
I take Lucas's use of the word "understanding" to mean
"interpreting"&#x02014;and interpreting in a manner distinct from reading,
because you cannot read what is not language. For prehistory to have
its purchase, it is essential that the objects material culture engages
be distinct from words, not only in the case of archaeology conceiving
prehistory as a time before text, but in the case of prehistory "put[ting]
material culture on an independent basis for understanding the past"
. The archaeologist is able, via material culture, to interpret
the object in a manner that does not involve reading it.
<p>
But this is not what the archaeologists are doing. In ceasing to see
a piece of rock as a thunderbolt and beginning to see it as a tool
the archaeologists are giving the objects authors: "These objects were
originally interpreted as 'solidified lightning' and viewed as natural
objects; we now recognize them as stone axes" . They are reading
the objects, ascribing to those objects intention and, coextensive with
that, meaning. It is the archaeologist's job to understand the difference
between a sign and a wonder, to distinguish between words and marks.
<p>
Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels have argued that the line between
"what a text means and what its author intends it to mean" is nonexistent;
the two instances


<b></b>


of meaning are "identical."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Their example was a set of marks washed up on a seashore which resembled
a Wordsworth stanza. The marks looked like poetry, but as Knapp and
Michaels argued, were one to believe that the marks were produced by
chance, rather than an author, the marks could mean nothing, because
they were not language. This argument rests on their contention that
"marks produced by chance are not words at all but only resemble them"
("AT," 732).
<p>
If you assign meaning to a set of marks, you are ascribing to them
intention, and with that comes the transformation of marks to language. If
you ascribe intention, you are reading a language. The limit case is
found in Lucas's advocacy of archaeology as "an engagement with the
unconstituted present" , which finds its perfect articulation in
garbology. Knowing how to read garbage means laying bare "the frequent
incongruity between what people said and thought about their consumption
habits and what they actually did" , dealing with "contexts in
which discursivity is either absent or <i>intentionally suppressed</i>"
(117; emphasis added). The archaeologist who studies garbage is able
to talk trash, to access meaning and intention at a purer&#x02014;because
less pasteurized&#x02014;level. Archaeologists are doomed to be readers.
<p>
Lucas states that were one to be employing material culture as both object
of scrutiny and as methodology "there can be no date or time after which
we might say that this is no longer archaeology" . Inevitably, the
issue becomes identity&#x02014;both in the sense of what archaeology is,
and how archaeology continues through time in a consistent enough fashion
to be understood as a continuous, however modified, entity. Lucas says
that he does not find these questions to be interesting ones: "[S]ome
skeptics might question whether such a project is archaeology. Well,
actually I do not care. And I am not sure many people care that much about
disciplinary purity, which is surely the only reason for engaging in such
debate" . I intend zero slight to Professor Lucas when I suggest
a parallel between his position and the joke's punch line: no slight is
intended because just as the farmer understands the pig to be concerned
not with theory but with apples, Lucas is saying that archaeologists are
more interested in how they spend their time than in what other people
think they are doing with it. This is quite healthy. However, Lucas takes
the notion of "disciplinary purity" as continuous with the practice of
naming, and this need not be. Happily, it is not the case that in order
to call a discipline by its name one must believe that the discipline
is homogenous, autonomous, endogamous, monogamous or in any sense pure.
<p>
This allows me to say that I have a sneaking feeling that an archaeology
concerned with 2004 is something in excess of itself&#x02014;forensic
sociology, anthropological eschatoscopy avant la lettre,
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
or perhaps what Bill Brown will one day call "object relations in an
expanded field."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Like Lucas, this does not trouble me; it fails to trouble me not
because I am attempting to demonstrate that that there is no such thing
as archaeology, but because arguing over the evolution of the word
archaeology is proof that it means something, despite (and because of)
the fact that people feel more or less comfortable with seeing themselves
as informed by, or others as partaking of, its identity. However, I
am ready to be chastised by archaeologists. And in order to facilitate
this, I will end by pushing Lucas's argument beyond the logical extreme:
why not


<b></b>


advocate that archaeology unearth the future? The question of what
archaeology is may most convincingly be answered by those who are doing
it, but it is only verifiable as such by those who one day will have
done something else.

Such foresightedness I owe less to my archaeological capacities
than to the fact that Bill Brown considered this option aloud in my
presence. Brown's work on the relation between things and objects is
highly relevant to the issues I raise here; see his "Thing Theory,"
<i>Critical Inquiry</i> 28, no. 1 (autumn 2001): 1-16; and <i>A Sense of
Things: The Object Matter of American Literature</i> (Chicago: University
