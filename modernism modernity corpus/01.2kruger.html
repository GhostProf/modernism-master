<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Sunday, 3 June 1934, African artists and intellectuals, American Board
Missionaries, liberal whites associated with the Joint European/African
Council, and an educated, predominantly African audience gathered at
the Bantu Men's Social Centre (BMSC) in downtown Johannesburg for an
Emancipation Centenary Celebration, commemorating the abolition of
slavery in the British Empire in 1834.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The Celebration
included speeches by American missionaries and leading Africans, such
as R. V. Selope Thema (editor of <I>Bantu World)</I> and A. B. Xuma
(later President of the African National Congress [ANC]); performances
of Handel's <I>Messiah;</I> hymns composed by Europeans, Africans, and
Americans; and "Negro spirituals." It culminated in a "dramatic display,"
the subject of which was not the emancipation of slaves in the Empire,
but rather the lives of slaves in the United States. Incidental music
was written by Reuben Caluza, known for composing and collecting Zulu
folk-songs, and the text by his cousin Rolfes Dhlomo. The evening's
performances were organized and directed by Herbert Dhlomo, Rolfes's
brother and a dramatist in his own right.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drawing on the variety format of Edwardian pageants and the music hall,
the performance also borrowed freely from the speeches of Lincoln and
Frederick Douglass and the portrayal of the "life of the lowly" in
<I>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</I> The "dramatic display" itself, including a
slave auction, labor in the fields, and the coming of freedom performed by
adults and children in chorus, highlighted the pathos of the

<B></B>

lot
of both slaves and ex-slaves: "the suffering of the American Negroes on
the slave market, in the cotton fields and at home, until the joyful news
of the liberation";
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 and the "feelings of joy and relief, which
the right ending of the struggle for freedom had brought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

Although these reports in <I>Bantu World</I> and <I>Umteteli wa Bantu,</I>
the major African papers, give us no details about the music accompanying
these scenes, it is likely, given Caluza's international reputation
as a composer of nationalist hymns and Zulu folksongs (recorded by His
Master's Voice in London in 1930), that it drew on his "sorrow songs"
about the dispossession of South African blacks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Likewise,
the dramatic interpretations of key speeches such as the Gettysburg
Address, delivered by Griffiths Motsieloa, leader of the minstrel troupe
the Darktown Strutters, and the record company Gallophone's answer to His
Master's Voice, probably resonated with the audience differently from the
praise heaped on British and American emancipators in the African press.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Politically charged as this event certainly was, it had nonetheless no
single political meaning. Permitted by the neocolonial state and applauded
by white liberal paternalists, it was enthusiastically received not
only by the members of the BMSC but also by the more diverse--and more
disaffected--audience at the Eastern Native Township performance. This
occasion thus eludes the familiar dichotomy between white colonial
hegemony and the oppressed black masses (or between high English culture
and clearly identifiable working-class practices), a dichotomy that has
long pervaded South African criticism and underlies key formulations of
current postcolonial theory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In this schema, members of the
New African elite, the small intermediary class of clergymen, teachers,
and other professionals who organized events such as the Emancipation
Celebration, are distinguished above all by their attachment to European
civilization and thus by their alienation from the masses of black
people, whether this alienation is read as the irredeemable result of
their colonial assimilation and distance from popular African cultural
expression
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 or as a measure of the obstacles to their attempts
at representing either African concerns in general or the interests of
an emerging working class in particular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This retrospective
judgment carries some weight in present-day debates about South African
cultural politics but it does not fully acknowledge the fluidity in 1934
of these class and ethnic affiliations, or the volatility of New African
identification with "European civilization." To be sure, the editor
of <I>Bantu World</I> joined the American Board Mission in urging his
readers to beware of the unChristian tactics of the Bolsheviks and to
"honor the great emancipators" such as Livingstone or Lincoln, whose
examples show the way to "rescue [the world] from the thraldom of
nationalist and racial passions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 He did so, however, with
the knowledge that other New Africans were disputing European claims to
represent Christian civilization on the grounds that the South African
state's treatment of most of the population, a century after emancipation,
betrayed Christian ideals and universal rights.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The imperial decorum of the missionary school syllabus, which supplemented
the great tradition of Shakespeare and the post-Romantic poets with the
likes of

<B></B>

Kipling and John Buchan, was in its turn challenged by
American and African American popular culture ranging from abolitionist
melodrama and political rhetoric to a popular mixture of jubilee
singing, ragtime, jazz, and minstrelsy, all of which reached a wide
African audience in venues that ranged from the BMSC to the slumyard and
dance halls frequented by city workers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 New Africans saw in
the metropolitan, modernizing impulse of the New Negro an alternative,
on the one hand, to neocolonial retribalization and the essentially
anti-urban complexion of English culture in the mission schools and, on
the other, to the allegedly degraded forms of jazz and minstrelsy, which
the African elite saw as corrupting the <I>abaphakathi</I> (the people in
between--neither assimilated to "European" modernity nor any longer at
home with indigenous custom).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Even in the 1930s, after the
New Negro star had faded, the distance travelled by African Americans from
slavery to visible (if uneven) participation in American life--as well
as the distance still untravelled--provided a crucial point of reference
for criticizing the curtailment of civil rights for black South Africans.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite their identification with the African American elite, the
"talented tenth," in W. E. B. Dubois's phrase, New Africans were compelled
to acknowledge the appeal of African American popular culture, including
jazz, if only in response to African American assertions of pan-African
affiliation. Thus, musician and critic Mark Radebe uses a Garveyite term,
"Africans in America," to pay homage to African American inflections of
popular American music and to "the enormous influence of Bantu rhythms on
the world's music."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 New African negotiation of these African
American currents thus complicates any received dichotomy between British
imperialism and African resistance, between imported art and indigenous
practice or, indeed, between modernity and its apparently premodern,
"savage" other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New African exploration of the territory marked out by these oppositions
was both contradictory and productive. It involved often passionately
inconsistent appropriation of English cultural artifacts, American
popular entertainments, and indigenous traditions, in which the
transformation (but not the destruction) of "Africanness" through
colonization formed the basis for a thoroughly modern hybridity. In
the performance of hybridity--in drama, pageants, and national
commemorations--any distinction between a degraded missionary literature
"produced under imperial licence"
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 and the irony, parody,
or "sly civility" of postcolonial (post)modern writing is thoroughly
blurred.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Postcolonial criticism, as exemplified by the
influential anthology, <I>The Empire Writes Back,</I> acknowledges this
blur when it uses "the postcolonial to cover all culture affected by
the imperial process from the moment of colonization to the present-day"
(<I>EWB,</I> 2).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 It also admits that the difference between
"licensed missionary writing" and "postcolonial appropriation" is not
simply a matter of the mastery or appropriation of literary form but
rather the effect of the colonial institution of literature, in which a
narrow range of normative models is promoted and in which publication,
patronage, and reception fall under the control of the colonial authority
(<I>EWB,</I> 6). Acknowledging that constraints on cultural production
under colonialism

<B></B>

 or a neocolonial regime such as South Africa's
include the inculcation of European literary norms as though they were
universal does not, however, lead the authors of <I>The Empire Writes
Back</I> to challenge the norm of the "literary" as such, whose central
value as an exemplary form of (post)colonial culture is not self-evident
in societies in which universal literacy was not and still is not
the rule.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The presupposition of literacy, indeed of a highly developed mastery
of English or other European languages, as the necessary condition for
postcolonial culture betrays the metropolitan and literary orientation of
postcolonial criticism. Even if it draws from writers and theorists who
are not metropolitan in origin, it grants pride of place to the knowing
self-reflexive texts of the contemporary cosmopolitan (such as Salman
Rushdie or J. M. Coetzee) and treats the work (textual only in part) of
less mobile, less recent (post)colonial subjects as colonial imitation or
immature approximations of postcolonial hybridity. By using literary norms
to test (and discredit) cultural production from places and periods quite
different from the contemporary metropolis, postcolonial criticism tends
to treat the complexity of hybrid performance practices as insufficiently
sophisticated writing and thus to subordinate local histories, cultures,
and politics to the dictates of a present-day cosmopolitan hegemony.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This postcolonial avantgardism has a contradictory relation to the
history of imperialism (and anti-imperialism) on which it rests. On the
one hand, it acknowledges "the continuity of preoccupations throughout the
historical process of European aggression" (<I>EWB,</I> 2). On the other,
it asserts, rather prematurely, that "the postcolonial world is one in
which the destructive cultural encounter [of colonization] is changing
into an acceptance of difference on equal terms" (<I>EWB,</I> 36). Far
from "dealing with the problem of transmuting time into space," theories
that associate postcoloniality with a mode of reading (<I>EWB,</I> 163)
or even identifiable discursive features (<I>EWB,</I> 193), rather than a
condition defined by the cultural, political, and economic negotiation of
the shifting--but by no means receding--conditions of metropolitan power,
exacerbate the problem. By treating the uneven developments and parallel
but decidedly unequal histories within a particular political terrain
as a spatial relation between center and margin or between different
but equal discourses, postcoloniality threatens to <I>recolonize</I> the
tangled partial and unsynchronized histories of neocolonial culture and
society
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 and, in so doing, to disavow its own roots in this
uneven development.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stepping back from the brink of the beyond, the "trope of the 'post'"
that Homi Bhabha has identified as the sign of our times,
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

or what I would call the abstract finality of the postcolonial, we
ought to begin by looking at how the New Africans came to terms with the
institutions within which they emerged and against which they struggled
to represent themselves as legitimate South African subjects. New
Africans were indeed marked by an "imperial licence" in the form of the
missions and their schools, state surveillance of African newspapers,
and leisure organizations sponsored by European philanthropists, as well
as the more

<B></B>

overt racial discrimination of the self-governing Union
(since 1910), but they were not completely controlled by it. At a moment
when political rights for even elite Africans were curtailed, culture,
whether seen as arts or entertainment, became a crucial site for the
contestation of the legitimacy of African participation in public. As the
Emancipation Celebration and other "pageants" commemorating important
dates in a New African calendar suggest, theatre in the broadest sense
(dramatic representations for an audience) was a primary site of
contestation. Marginalized in a general South African public sphere
defined in racially exclusive terms, New African theatre articulated
what might be called a <I>virtual public sphere,</I> a discursive
and social field within which alternative representations of South
Africa could be entertained without direct exposure to the wrath of
the state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a virtual public sphere, theatre operates in the subjunctive rather
than indicative mood. It skirts the dangerous field of immediate
political action in order to gain a testing ground for competing
representations of the nation. At stake here is the attempt to seize
the idea of modernity--citizenship, emancipation, individual and
collective agency--from its prevailing colonial representation; the
attempt, in other words, to "deploy, deform, and defuse" neocolonial
institutions and formations so as to make "many modernities" out of
colonial modernization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to understand the terms of this virtual public sphere, we should
specify the character of neocolonial domination in South Africa in the
1930s. These were years in which the South African state dramatically
increased restrictions on the economic, political, and cultural mobility
of Africans through legislation such as the Urban Areas Act  and
its amendments in the 1930s: the Slums Act , which allowed for
the clearance of urban slumyards while restricting African access to
property or residence in urban areas, and the Native Representative Act
, which was to eliminate the last Africans from the Common Voters
Roll. It was also a period of political and cultural fluidity among
urban and urbanizing Africans in which different modes of resistance to
and negotiation of this dispensation were played out. Conflicts between
the modernizing drive of the state and its increasingly segregationist
ideology, between chiefs keen to maintain traditional ways and the
"civilizing" ambitions of the missionaries, and between African
nationalist and communist interpretations of the risks and benefits of
modernization for the black majority made for fractious and unstable
allegiances among different dominant and subaltern groups. The partially
transracial class solidarity among industrial workers in the 1920s was
giving way, under pressure from demands for the reservation of skilled
work for "poor [Afrikaans] whites," to class divisions on racial lines,
while the African National Congress, the Communist Party of South Africa,
and other groups that were to galvanize the population in the 1940s and
1950s were not yet mass organizations with effective political force.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beset by internal disputes, African Nationalists struggled in vain to
present a united front against the state. The conservative ascendancy
in the ANC, led by Pixley ka Seme and John Dube (president of the
Zulu-dominated Natal branch), tended to see in the state's program
of "separate development" an opportunity for what might be called
<I>retraditionalization.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Retraditionalization implies
not so much a return to premodern rural life as a reappropriation
of clan authority and custom as the means to a tangible if limited
autonomy, consolidating the power of the chiefs eroded by the emergence
of the New Africans on the one hand, and the mass migration of landless
blacks to the cities on the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It was thus not so much
a rejection of modernity as an attempt to appropriate certain aspects
of modernization, especially vernacular literacy and the technological
reproduction or recording of traditional practices and artifacts, so
as to reinvent habitual tribal affiliation as a "natural" respect for
traditional authority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This retraditionalist tendency collided with the habits and convictions
of New Africans in the cities, especially Johannesburg, who by and large
held to the belief that the benefits of modernization would ultimately
outweigh the disruption of communal life and tribal loyalties caused by
colonization. The editor Selope Thema, for instance, defended African
appropriation of the benefits of European civilization, such as literacy
and individual rights, while acknowledging the value of traditional
communal organization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Revaluating the authority of the
chiefs, in particular the legendary power of the Zulu king Shaka over
a now scattered Zulu nation, Herbert Dhlomo argued that those invoking
Shaka defended the glories of a Zulu past rather than civil rights in the
present and were advocating a "new kind of tribalism...[that] encourages
non-progressive institutions among the people and [makes] the government
the supreme chief and dictator."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 And, in his only published
play, <I>The Girl who Killed to Save</I> , the exhortations of the
Xhosa prophetess Nongqause, who in 1856 urged the Xhosa to kill their
cattle in anticipation of divine wrath being visited on the colonizers,
and the consequent starvation of the clan are ultimately rered and
the deaths redeemed as the price paid for civilization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet an editorial published almost a year before the Emancipation Centenary
Celebration remained sceptical of European intentions to honor the promise
of universal rights: "it is true that Natives can no longer be bought and
sold...but they are still in bondage as a people and there is a determined
stand by Europeans against the grant to them [<I>sic</I>] of that full
liberty to which all men are entitled.... Natives are not slaves, but they
are not freemen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Emphasizing the entrenchment of racial
prejudice despite formal freedoms, the editorial draws on the insights
of W. E. B. Dubois's <I>The Souls of Black Folk</I> to combat the notion
of separate development under segregation accepted by Seme, Dube, and
others influenced by the example of Booker T. Washington.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

Profoundly suspicious of European definitions of the authentically
African that were promulgated by apologists for development along the
"Native's own lines," this and other editorials urged readers to bring
together African and European traditions by participating

<B></B>

 in cultural
institutions such as the BMSC, the Gamma Sigma debating societies, or
the Eisteddfodau, festivals of choral singing and dramatic monologues
loosely based on Welsh (and British imperial) models.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At its most instrumental, culture became a form of social control. Mining
industrialists argued that monitoring their employees after hours
meant a "good business investment" in the "moral and physical health
of the workforce."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Missionaries hoped to curb social and
economic unrest and the "swaggering, sweeping claims of Communism" by
"moralizing the leisure time of the natives";
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Ray Phillips,
author of the assimilationist <I>The Bantu are Coming</I> , for
instance, appealed to the Chamber of Mines to fund activities ranging
from the elite BMSC to Chaplin evenings for mine workers. More subtle,
perhaps, were the aspirations of the African retraditionalists such as
Dube, Caluza, and others who saw in the state's interest in preserving
"native ways" an occasion for reestablishing a coherent ethnic inheritance
from rural practices fractured by colonization. In the space between the
instrumentalization of culture in the production of modernized subjects,
whether among the mine and other industrial workers or in the black
intermediary class, and the evocation of culture as a retraditionalized
refuge from the ravages of modernization, the ambiguous notion of the
disinterestedness of culture offered an escape, at once compelling
and imaginary, from daily humiliations. This relative autonomy could
and did give cultural production an affirmative cast, in Marcuse's
sense of reinforcing the status quo by providing an imaginary refuge
from it,
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 but it also offered at least the framework for a
virtual public sphere, as I have defined it, as a site for the subjunctive
enactment of an African agency.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The variety of theatre by and for Africans in 1930s Johannesburg suggests
the contemporary persistence as well as the limitations of oppositions
between elite and popular, imported and indigenous, literary and oral
culture. <I>She Stoops to Conquer,</I> the Bantu Dramatic Society's
inaugural production , was perhaps closest to the English genteel
culture of the mission schools, but the "tribal sketches" of the Lucky
Stars and the All African Eisteddfodau, which combined European and
African theatrical and musical forms, were also indebted to missionary
education. They in their turn inspired the commercially successful
African "revues" and pageants by the popular Darktown Strutters and their
successors, De Pitch Black Follies, whose leader Griffiths Motsieloa also
participated in the Eisteddfodau. On the other hand, the Bantu People's
Players' 1936 version of <I>The Hairy Ape</I> (which was to have been
the Bantu Dramatic Society's first production) combined the agitprop
skills of Belgian socialist Andre van Gyseghem (then in South Africa as
Director of Pageants for the Empire Exhi-bition) with the local resonance
of Fanagalo, the pidgin used by miners and their bosses, to produce
a more emphatic representation of social and economic injustice. The
Bantu Dramatic and Operatic Society's production of <I>Moshoeshoe,</I>
Herbert Dhlomo's dramatization of the charismatic nineteenth-century
Sotho

<B></B>

leader, attempted to bring together the "tribal sketch," the
history play, and the Eisteddfod recital in a dramatic response to the
ascendancy of segregationist ideology by the end of the decade.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hybrid character of these experiments resides not only in their use of
form but also in the tensions between form and occasion of performance,
especially in the representation of African tradition in the modern
European medium of naturalist drama. The reconstruction of a legitimate
(rather than verifiably authentic) folk culture in this period relies
heavily, as Veit Erlmann has demonstrated in his account of South African
music, on the invention of tradition and a "usable past"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

"out of the disparate remnants of a shattered rural order" (<I>AS,</I>
150). In the creation of an African National Theatre, as in that of an
African music, finding a usable past was not so much an act of pure
discovery as a process of collection, recollection, and invention,
of grafting together African and European material in ways that would
resonate with performers and audiences. The strict correspondence between
actor and embodied character, and the naturalist convention of situating
the actor's expression of interiority in a set designed to represent a
particular exterior or interior environment, both characteristic of the
early twentieth-century metropolitan mainstream, had little in common with
the more fluid and more overtly rhetorical relationship between performer,
character and location in the praise-songs, folktales, and community
dancing characteristic of southern Bantu performance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of language, the hegemony of literary culture and genteel
norms, and the weakness (relative to music) of an African American
mediating term made the development of an African National Theatre more
complicated than its musical counterpart. The central site for this
"invention of tradition" was paradoxically also the crucible for elite
modernization: the mission schools, such as Lovedale, Amanzimtoti--later
Adams--College, or the Ohlange Institute, John Dube's counterpart
to Tuskegee. Institutions such as these had long encouraged school
performances of dramatic sketches, sometimes on English subjects, and
often as "reconstructions of tribal life" (<I>AS</I>, 64).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

These sketches, in combination with exposure to metropolitan literature
and music, provided the inspiration for the Lucky Stars, founded in
1929 by the Mthethwa brothers, who were educated, like the Dhlomos,
at Amanzimtoti College. Their sketches portrayed such subjects as
<I>Ukuqomisa</I> (courting) or <I>Umthakathi</I> (the sorcerer) and often
concluded with a rousing dance finale. Although formed in large part by
an elite place and occasion (mission schools, the BMSC, and the like),
the Lucky Stars were enthusiastically received by black workers and those
on the fringes of the formal economy, especially in less industrialized
Natal, where audiences found these "idealized images of a rural past" a
welcome escape from their double alienation, in racial and class terms,
from "civilization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet claims that the Lucky Stars offered an early but unmistakable
instance of critical or satirical black theatre
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 and
should therefore be seen as forerunners of the anti-apartheid protest
theatre of the 1970s,
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 should be treated with caution. The
origins of the sketches in the folkloric recuperation of the missions
did not

<B></B>

prevent them from being appropriated by a diverse popular
audience, but the ethnic emphasis, even exclusiveness, of the sketches
was problematic; it reflected as much the Zulu pride of the performers,
most of whom came from the Zulu-identified Amanzimtoti College,
as the desire to challenge the social and economic discrimination
against all Africans. Since they were performed in the Zulu language
and in historically reconstructed Zulu costume (rather than the mixed
traditional and modified attire worn in rural Zululand at the time), the
alleged satirical intent of the sketches would have been only partially
recognizable to speakers of other Bantu languages who saw the shows,
whose responses may have been affected as much by the music (itself a
hybridization of urban and rural forms) and the tangible presence of
African actors as by the sketches' authentic details. The account of the
Jewish South African impresario, Bertha Slosberg, who promoted the group
from 1933 through its crowning appearance at the Empire Exhibition in
1936, emphasizes the spectacular as well as the folkloric dimension the
thrilling dancing as well as the need "to salvage from European influence,
the remaining power, the native simplicity, the splendid savage grandeur
of a dying pagan land."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Banishing "Natives" after 8 P.M. and
thus excluding them from "entertainments for Europeans,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

the Exhibition marginalized the urban African who might disturb the
ethnographic entertainment for white audiences. This arrangement fostered
primitivist nostalgia among whites anxious to preserve "images of native
domestic life," but did not prevent the performance from "influenc[ing]
Johannesburg Location productions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Lucky Stars were praised by white spectators of the Empire
Exhibition for their displays of rural life, their successors attempted
to capitalize on the appeal of the sketches for urban black audiences,
while deploying the form to somewhat different ends. Although De Pitch
Black Follies were, like the Lucky Stars, dependent on the benevolence
of white city officials and white capital (including the patronage of
Gallophone), they did not limit their performances to the "coon songs"
<I>(izikhunzi)</I> implied by their minstrel label and popular with
working-class audiences, or to the Zulu folksongs and sketches that formed
the repertoire of many of their mission-educated members such as Motsieloa
(<I>AS,</I> 164, 171), and which appealed more to the sensibilities of the
retraditionalists. A description in <I>Bantu World</I> of De Pitch Black
Follies performing "Africa--a revel pageant" in 1940 suggests an emphasis

views permeating the earlier event. The format of the "revel pageant,"
however, recalls the Empire

Exhibition's presentation of the Lucky
Stars. Like that performance, this one included spectacular displays of
"African traditional dance" as well as comic skits from the minstrel
repertoire. This motley combination of uplift and self-mocking
exaggeration, familiar from the vaudeville revues throughout the
decade, was regarded with some concern by New Africans, who feared,
as one commentator wrote, that excessive exposure to jazz and other
distractions would "deafen our appreciation for art," including the
"greater beauty and entertainment" of drama.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Herbert
Dhlomo, regarded by himself and other New Africans (and some whites) as
a spokesman for an "African tradition grafted onto the European," was
critical not only of the commodification of African tradition as "exotic
crudities"
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 but also of its embalming as "static museum-like
plays."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Like the New Negro who challenged white society's
"sentimental interest" in black traditions and the "double standard" of
the "philanthropic attitude" among white American liberals,
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

the New African was suspicious of those who expressed concern for
"native" traditions while remaining either indifferent or hostile to
black aspirations to transform society as a whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even prominent critics of retraditionalist rhetoric such as Herbert
Dhlomo were nonetheless obliged to recognize its usefulness in addressing
an audience caught up in the contradictions of colonial modernity. In
the period between his first play, <I>The Girl Who Killed to Save</I>
(written in 1934), and the 1939 production of <I>Moshoeshoe,</I> Dhlomo
moved closer to an emphasis on "tribal drama" and traditional forms. An
early version of an essay entitled "The Importance of African Drama"
indicates the prospects and the pitfalls Dhlomo saw in the idea of an
African National Theatre:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Modern drama is not a mere emotional entertainment. It is a source of
ideas, a cultural and educational factor, an agency for propaganda and,
above all, it is literature. What part will the new African play in
modern drama? On its physical                  side, he can contribute
strong, fast rhythm, speedy action, expressive vigorous gesture
and movement, powerful dramatic speech--no small contribution when
modern plays drag so tediously.... We want African playwrights who
will dramatize ...African History. We want dramatic representations of
African Serfdom. Oppression, Exploitation, and Metamorphosis.... The
African dramatist...can expose evil and corruption and not suffer libel
as newspapermen do; he can guide and preach to his people as preachers
cannot do. To do this he must be an artist before a propagandist; a
philosopher before a reformer, a psychologist before a patriot; be true
to his African "self" and not be prey to exotic crudities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dhlomo defends the priority of literary drama, yet he insists that the
strong performative dimension of African oral traditions should inform
any African National Theatre. He calls for the dramatic representation of
social injustice, but also argues that the modern African dramatist should
be artist before propagandist. This inconsistency certainly expresses the
tension between the precepts of

<B></B>

Dhlomo's missionary education (which
defended the timelessness of art against the contingencies of politics)
and the pressures of the historical moment that push him and his peers
towards commitment, but it also speaks for the concept of art, in this
case theatre, as a form of negative critique or virtual public sphere.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appeal to art before propaganda therefore should not be read as
a capitulation to imposed norms of gentility. Rather, it attempts to
use the notion of artistic autonomy to negotiate cultural space for
the contestation of oppression in an environment in which more direct
action (from political mobilization to adversarial journalism) was
increasingly curtailed. Framing the revitalization of tradition in
the generalizing terms of African nationalism, Dhlomo challenges both
white and black separatists when he argues, in a 1939 essay entitled
"Why Study Tribal Dramatic Forms?" that this revitalization should
transform not only African forms but also modern drama as a whole by
"infus[ing] new blood into the weary limbs of the older dramatic forms
of Europe" ("WST," 35). The hint of deference is more than offset by the
critical reference to the "weary limbs...of Europe" or, in the earlier
essay, to the "tedium" of modern (by implication, English) plays. This
disdain for the "acting plays" of the commercial theatre in favor of
"literary drama" ("WST," 39) that might also propagandize for social
change echoes the aspirations of the advocates of the "new social drama"
(G. B. Shaw, John Galsworthy, and their contemporaries) in Britain, but,
like them, stops well short of a radical abolition of aesthetics in the
manner of Brecht's <I>Lehrst&uuml;cke</I> or the proletarian agitprop
in both the United States and Britain during this period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The example of metropolitan social drama, its attempt to be both literary
and engaged, independent of the pressure to make a profit yet able to
draw an audience, exercises a significant but not overwhelming influence
on Dhlomo's reflections on drama and the African. Whereas Dhlomo's
suggested themes may confirm the influence of Shaw or Galsworthy, his
ideal institution of theatre differs from that of the metropolitan
"new drama," whose producers relied on a modified version of the
commercial theatre. Against this commodification of drama, Dhlomo
envisages performance legitimated as an occasion in the social life of a
community. In "The Nature and Variety of Tribal Drama" , he points
to the close relationship between the occasion of performance and the
commemoration of significant events, rites of passage, seasonal festivals,
and the like and argues that traditional African drama shares with the
classical Greek its integration into the social fabric.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 This
evocation of a theatre of ritual power, of "sympathetic magic," does not
entail a nostalgic revival of tribal community, but rather the reverse:
"The African artist cannot delve into the Past unless he has first grasped
the Present. African art can grow and thrive not only by...excavat-ing
archaical art forms, but by grappling with present-day realities" ("WST,"
40). Instead of "static museum-like drama based on primitive tradition and
culture" ("WST," 39), Dhlomo envisaged an African National Theatre that
might appropriate those African performance forms that lent themselves
to a critical engagement between past and present.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While highlighting the public character of these forms, however, he
insists that they be evaluated as "ends in themselves," in aesthetic
as well as functional terms ("NVT," 27). He appropriates the courtly
tradition of <I>izibongo</I> (praises--usually of the king or noble),
rather than the more demotic convention of <I>izinganekwane</I>
(folktales), and suggests a desire to legitimate a tradition of high
culture as universal as Greek tragedy in the European pantheon; but his
appeal to tradition rests on the distinctly modern invention of a term,
<I>izibongelo</I>, to bolster his claim that this panegyric form contains
within it traces of dramatic structure and that its function, like that of
drama, is to "tell the story of the nation" ("NVT," 23, 35).
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These essays thus record the impact of retraditionalist rhetoric. They
appeal to a "sacred inheritance" ("WST," 37) as the "ground on which a
great original African drama can be built" ("NVT," 35), even as they
speak to New African scepticism of the "museum-like" construction of
ethnicity as a display in ethnography's exhibition of discrimination. They
also register the strain in New African faith in modernization through
Europeanization. The ineffectual response of most white liberals to
the disenfranchisement of Africans and enforcement of the pass laws,
the state's indifference to the protests of the All African Convention
(AAC) held in December 1935, and the spectacle of European savagery in
Spain and Ethiopia, undermined the authority of "white civilization" as
such. As D. D. T. Jabavu, convener of the AAC, had it:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
After hearing a great deal for twenty years about the rights of small
nations, self-determination, Christian ideals, the
inviolability of treaties,...the glory of European civilization, and so
forth, the brief history of the last eight months [since the summoning
of the Convention in December 1935] has scratched this European veneer
and revealed the white savage hidden beneath.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Tim Couzens and Martin Orkin have pointed out, Dhlomo's dramatic
writing in this period responds more directly than before to the
contradictory impulses of colonial modernity, if not quite with the
ferocity of Jabavu, then in the more cautious spirit of Selope Thema:
"tribal life is not a peculiarity of the African race; it is a stage
through which the great nations of today have passed ...we have a right
to decide our own destiny and to make our distinctive contribution to
the world's civilizations."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The play most often cited in
this context is <I>Cetshwayo</I> (1936-37). Portraying the betrayal of
the last autonomous Zulu king in the 1870s by Theophilus Shepstone,
Governor of Natal, and his ally John Dunn, "English adventurer"
gone native, <I>Cetshwayo</I> is Dhlomo's most explicit indictment of
segregation and disenfranchisement conducted in the name of civilization
and Empire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 For all the argument for African forms and
conventions, however, the dramaturgy of <I>Cetshwayo</I> is thoroughly
Aristotelian or, more precisely, Schillerian, in that it focuses on a
national hero whose inability to see through the machinations of his
enemies brings about his tragic defeat;

<B></B>

African motifs, especially
<I>izibongo</I> of the king, tend to be subordinated to the forward
drive of the plot. Drawing on the Schillerian history play in its
English derivation as well as the conventions of Victorian melodrama,
especially in its treatment of the "white Zulu" Dunn, <I>Cetshwayo</I>
makes for stirring reading today. We can, however, only speculate on
the contemporary effect of this play, since it was neither published
nor publicly performed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Moshoeshoe</I>, written in the same period, was performed by the
Bantu Dramatic and Operatic Society at the BMSC in May 1939, in honor
of Moshoeshoe Day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Less adversarial than <I>Cetshwayo,
Moshoeshoe</I> portrayed the wisdom of the legendary Sotho statesman,
revered both for his ability to resolve conflicts between his
subjects and refugees from the Difecane (the mass migration caused
by Zulu expansionism in the 1830s), and as a model African leader
whose perspicacity was sadly missed a century later. By placing at
the center of his play a <I>pitso,</I> or people's assembly, Dhlomo
called to mind the current disputes of the ANC and AAC. The play's
emphasis on Moshoeshoe's criticism of ethnically divisive custom and
the temptations of dictatorship highlighted the relative success of the
Basutoland Protectorate's resistance against attempts at incorporation
and retribalization by the South African government.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The significance of <I>Moshoeshoe</I> does not lie solely in an
allegorical representation of a modern African state in embryo,
however. Equally important is the play's attempt to negotiate a new
association of form, content, and occasion of performance. Form, in
particular language, appears to have been the most problematic. Although
the play was praised in the African press for portraying an exemplary
African leader, its evocation of Sotho custom and its entwinement of
"legend and reality, action and philosophy,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 the attempt
to render Sotho praises, proverbs, and dialogue in English received a
mixed response. Whereas the <I>Bantu World</I> reviewer praised the play
as the first indigenous drama combining the efforts of Zulu (Dhlomo and
the composer Caluza) and Sotho (the choreographer, A. P. Khutlang, and
songwriter, Salome Masoleng) and justified the flowery verse and choppy
syntax by claiming that the play's "chief charm lies in the dialogue which
is a literal translation from the language in which it was originally
written,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 his <I>Umteteli</I> counterpart maintained that
"there was too much of the refined" in the dialogue and accused the actors
of not being "typically Masotho." Songs in Sotho rather than English, he
argues, "would have contributed much to making the play a strong living
drama of a significant episode in our national life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 This
dispute reflects the strain in the language of the play between a desire
for idiomatic authenticity and an aspiration to poetic language that would
transcend local specificity and "find the changeless in the changing,
the fundamental in the ephemeral."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 It also suggests that
the question of authenticity was itself subject to dispute and could
not be resolved in terms of form or stable literary value, but rather
in terms of the significance of the occasion of performance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The occasion of the performance was likewise subject to strain. Although
the play was performed at the BMSC and not, for instance, in the setting
dominated

<B></B>

by the mountain Thaba Bosiu, where Moshoeshoe held his
<I>pitso,</I> or its namesake in Pimville, near Johannesburg, where
political meetings were held,
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 its loosely linked scenes--the
<I>pitso</I> at the center, framed by suitors' quarrels and encounters
between the Basotho, a wandering bard, and refugees from the Difecane,
and ending with a harvest festival--suggest a recurrent commemoration
rather than a unique story. The music for the performance, like that
for the Emancipation Centenary, would have at least alluded to melodies
already familiar from Caluza's songs of national sorrow such as "iLand
Act" and "Elamakosi," which lament African dispossession and appeal to
the chiefs for guidance. Dhlomo would have liked to legitimate his play
in the eyes of an African public by drawing on the immediate authority
of the Convention as well as the comparison with numerous Moshoeshoe
Day rallies, but this legitimation was far from secure. While reviewers
picked up the contemporary resonance of the <I>pitso</I> and readers and
audience alike would have made the connection between the <I>pitso</I>
and the rallies, the harvest festival that concludes the play does not
quite bring in the yield. The festival envelops but cannot incorporate
the missionaries who praise Moshoeshoe's genius only to cast doubt
on the enactment of his legacy: "Moshoeshoe...a man consumed by the
smouldering and devastating fire of...great expectations unfulfilled,
of plans and ambitions whose very attainment would give birth to plans
and ambitions never to be attained."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 This ambiguous praise
strikes a cautionary note against the soaring <I>izibongo</I> at the
end; the allusion to the citadel of Thaba Bosiu and to "Moshoeshoe the
man-mountain, the mountain-mind" has the status of tradition but not
the force of historical inevitability.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In dramatizing the discrepancy between the celebration of the African
exemplar and the implied deflection of his legacy while not providing
a resolution, <I>Moshoeshoe</I> represents the historical impasse faced
by the New Africans. In 1934, the Emancipation Centenary Celebration was
still able to sustain the legitimacy of liberal paternalism, bolstered
by the conviction held by the promoters, participants, and many in
the audience of the necessary conjunction of emancipation, modernity,
and European civilization. In 1939, however, this quintessen-tially
New African conviction was evaporating in the white heat of European
savagery at home and abroad. In the decades to follow, a revitalized
African nationalism was to break this impasse and galvanize resistance
to the segregationist state. <I>Moshoeshoe,</I> with its juxtaposition
of incompatible elements and its lack of resolution--in short, its
<I>in</I>authenticity--does not offer a model for the protest literature
that was to accompany (but not necessarily reflect) this resistance
and that was to characterize much black South African writing from the
1940s to the present. The flaws and fissures in the text of the play,
however, and the occasion of its performance speak more truly than any
tragic catharsis or resounding fictional triumph to the pressures of the
historical moment, the aspirations of New Africans, and the fundamental
incoherence of colonial modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aporia at the heart of colonial modernity consists most obviously in
the incommensurability of the promise, on the one hand, of universal
rights and

<B></B>

emancipation--in short, modernity--and, on the
other, the practice of liberal paternalism and limited civilization
under neocolonial tutelage. What is at issue, however, is not simply the
details of a particular South African history, but rather the character
of modernity in general or, more concretely, modernity historically and
presently generalized from the metropole to the margins. New African
interpretation of what Clifford Geertz has called the "dispersions and
discontinuities of modern life" is in part "local knowledge," but it is
also vernacular redeployment of metropolitan knowledge and, as such,
has broad implications for the interpretation of current postcolonial
"dispersions and discontinuities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New African hybridization of the dramatic and critical repertories
disseminated by missionary schools and other neocolonial institutions
may be historically distinct from current postcolonial hybridity but is
nonetheless structurally comparable to the appropriation of metropolitan
discourses in other colonial and postcolonial environments, including
the current one of <I>The Empire Writes Back.</I> The authority of this
text and others like it depends on a paradoxical inheritance: on the one
hand, postcolonial critics draw on metropolitan modes of interpretation
historically disseminated and deformed in local institutions--from mission
schools to universities--which are at best only partially accessible to
colonized subjects like the New Africans or their descendants. On the
other hand, these critics owe the legitimacy of the field to precisely
those local knowledges and particular histories that have so far eluded
appropriation. If postcolonial theory is to take seriously its own
assertion that "the inauthentic, the marginal," rather than practices
legitimated by either traditional or metropolitan authority, "is the
real" of postcolonial writing (<I>EWB,</I> 41), then it must begin by
acknowledging this ambiguous relation to its objects of study and, with
it, the debt of postcolonial (post)modernism to the contradictory legacy
of colonial modernity.

"African" commonly refers to Bantu-speaking people of reputedly
complete African ancestry, whether habitual speakers of English or the
vernaculars. The official government equivalent was "Native" until
the 1950s, when it was replaced by "Bantu." "Black" (as opposed to
the official term "non-European"), used since the 1970s to designate
all those disenfranchised by apartheid, is thus a term of political
rather than simply racial or ethnic identification, since it includes
those of mixed (so-called "Coloured") and Asian descent, who do not
regularly speak Bantu languages. "European," until recently synonymous
with "white," is a sign not so much of origin as political and cultural
hegemony and therefore implicitly intersects with "American" as well as
"English" society and culture.

As historians of leisure in South African cities have indicated,
class distinctions between elite and popular or petit bourgeois and
working class were solidifying in this period; but there were no "class
cultures" as such, as Belinda Bozzoli points out in the introduction
to <I>Town and Countryside in the Transvaal: Capitalist Penetration and
Popular Response</I> (Johannesburg: Ravan, 1983), 40. While those present
at the BMSC version of the Emancipation Celebration, for instance, were
reluctant to be associated with the alleged immorality of the marabi
dance and music culture of the slumyards but may have gone to minstrel
shows, the audience at the Eastern Native Township (not a slumyard) was
more likely to go to a marabi dance than to the Bantu Dramatic Society's
production of <I>She Stoops to Conquer</I> at the BMSC. The classification
of tastes according to class is here further complicated by the fact
that much of the minstrelsy and ragtime that arrived in South Africa in
the form of recorded and sheet music as well as touring companies was
"more 'white' than 'black' in terms of its musical components, but what
mattered was the way in which it was appropriated as an object of black
cultural pride in South Africa" (<I>AS</I>, 18).

<a NAME="FOOT14" HREF="#REF14">14</A>.
The strength of <I>The Empire Writes Back,</I> with its rather
foreshortened focus on those postcolonial texts that also display a
postmodern discursive play, lies in the elucidation of the more recent
writing of the "settler cultures" of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada
(the authors' points of origin and reference). Its comments on South
African writing tend either to be sketchy and one-dimensional, as in the
simple designation of Mofolo's <I>Chaka</I> (published in Sotho in 1910)
as "missionary literature" or elaborately out of time and place, as in
the reading of the exile Lewis Nkosi's <I>Mating Birds</I> , which
proceeds without engaging either the text's anachronism (the version
of apartheid in the novel bears scant relation to its implied time
and place) or its refraction by unmistakable American influences (most
obviously, Amiri Baraka's play, <I>Dutchman</I>). Despite these (and
other) moments of local blindness, or perhaps because of them, the book
has been remarkably influential, especially in metropolitan institutions;
it is for this reason that it is the primary focus of my critique.

Ali Mazrui and M. Tidy coin this term, in <I>Nationalism and
New States in Africa</I> (London: Heinemann, 1984), 282, to describe
a tactical appeal to tradition made by leaders of new African states
in the service of nationalist resistance to international models of
modernization; V. I. Mudimbe redeploys the concept, in <I>The Invention
of Africa</I> (Bloom-ington: Indiana University Press, 1988), 169, to
reflect on the ambiguity of invoking tradition as a weapon in the service
of modernization, albeit locally defined.

While the rhetoric of separate development appealed to chiefs
keen to maintain their ebbing authority and also to rural Africans
wary of living conditions in the cities (despite extreme rural poverty
brought about by the government's legalized land grab--the Land Act
of 1913), there can be no doubt that the government's interest in
segregation, although rationalized by contradictory assertions about
African self-determination and the vulnerability of the "child race,"
was firmly grounded in "European interests," especially in the desire
for a labor reserve uncontaminated by the "usual antagonism of class
war"; see Saul Dubow, "Race, Civilization and Culture: The Elaboration
of Segregationist Discourse in the Inter-war Years," in <I>The Politics
of Race, Class and Nationalism in South Africa,</I> ed. Shula Marks
and Stanley Trapido (London: Longman Publishing Group, 1989), 71-94. In
"Patriotism, Patriarchy, and Purity: Natal and the Politics of Zulu Ethnic
Consciousness," in <I>The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa,</I>
ed. Leroy Vail (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), Shula
Marks notes that ethnic consciousness in South Africa "has been the
product of intense ideological labour by the black intelligentsia and
white ideologues" , as the close ties between the Natal ANC, the
Zulu Cultural Society (founded in 1937), and the Department of Native
Affairs confirm.

In her classic account, <I>Oral Literature in Africa</I>
(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1970), Ruth Finnegan points out that
"while dramatic elements [such as impersonation, props, costume, and
the representation of interaction among characters] enter into several
different categories of artistic activity in Africa..., there are few or
no forms which include all these elements" . She argues that South
Bantu conventions in particular favor the sequential impersonations by
the storyteller or praise poet, rather than the dramatic imitation of
several characters, each by a designated actor.

occasion were thwarted by the South African government's refusal to give
passports to the performers. The contradictions in Slosberg's enthusiasm
for an authentic Zulu show and her willingness to challenge white South
African taboos (ranging from paying African performers a living wage
to socializing with them) become unmistakable in her readiness, after
the Lucky Stars dissolved in frustration in 1937, to devote the same
enthusiasm to a series of dance numbers in a show at the Drury Lane called
"The Sun Never Sets" (on the Empire?) performed mostly by Nigerians and
British blacks she trained (312-20).

The connection between Dhlomo and the "new drama" is not
accidental. Sybil Thorndyke, a major player (she played Desdemona
to Paul Robeson's Othello) at the Old Vic, a key venue for social
drama in 1930s London, visited Johannesburg in 1935. In response to a
performance for the Imperial Press Conference that included mineworkers
doing <I>ingoma</I> (Zulu "war" dancing) and choruses singing hymns
and shebeen songs, she urged white South Africans to learn from the
"black races" ("There was Real Acting at Wemmer," <I>Bantu World,</I>
2 March 1935, 1). For further discussion of tensions between "new" or
"social drama" and agitprop on  metropolitan stages in this period, see

The noun <I>izibongelo</I> appears to be derived from the verb
<I>-bongela</I> (roughly, praise for or directly to someone) and suggests
a performance for a target audience. The target, in this context, appears
to be not so much an individual object of praise as the nation as a whole
(at once audience and subject of the representation).

Moshoeshoe Day is celebrated in the Basutoland Protectorate
on 12 March in honor of the 1862 treaty that made Moshoeshoe subject
to Queen Victoria, the date of commemorations varied in South Africa,
perhaps because celebrations there responded to contemporary debates about
local sovereignty and the South African government's persistent but vain
attempts to annex the protectorates. The same day as the opening night
of <I>Moshoeshoe,</I> a Moshoeshoe Day celebration at Kroonstad praised
the Sotho leader as an "embodiment of democracy" in an "undemocratic
South Africa" ("Moshoeshoe Day, Celebrations in Kroonstad," Umteteli wa

Couzens notes the reference to Thaba Bosiu at the end of the
play and speculates on the connection to its Pimville namesake (Couzens,
<I>The New African,</I> 161-62). The publicity surrounding the Sotho
chief Joel Molapo's speech at Western Native Township on Moshoeshoe Day
(12 March) 1937 confirms the contemporary resonance of the occasion and
the aura of autonomy that it lent to a place (the township) otherwise
dominated by the Dept of Native Affairs.
