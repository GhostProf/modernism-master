<p>Modern science . . . would come upon secrets of Nature, as science had come before in Atlantis upon such secrets, and, spiritually arrogant and ignorant, intoxicated by knowledge, destroy America—the New Atlantis—in a series of holocausts, an end of Time in my life time that would come in fire-blast, as the end of Atlantean Time had come in earthquake and flood.</p>
<div class="attrib">—Robert Duncan, "The Truth and Life of Myth"</div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Plato, "the gods divided the whole earth into lots. . . . Poseidon, then, thus receiving as his lot the isle of Atlantis, settled his sons."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> So begins the rise and fall of Atlantis. Or call it a vision of primal unity and subsequent dispersal: the body of Tiamat, Osiris, Kronos; the polis of Eden, Wagadu, utopia's no place. Found in nearly every culture, the flood myth goes back behind Plato's Atlantis and the Judeo-Christian flood to at least the beginnings of the city (Sumer) and ancient Mesopotamian culture.</p>
<p>If there is such a primal vision of creation and destruction in the writings of San Francisco Renaissance poet Robert Duncan (1919–1988), it is based in the recurring dream he had throughout his life, what the poet called the Atlantis dream. The dream surfaces throughout his poetry and prose. Although no two versions of the dream are the same, each narrative begins in a meadow, where the subject is led forth to a ring of children, then to a cavern under the meadow that is ultimately destroyed by flood. In Duncan's magnum opus, <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>, the dream is and is not biological destiny: "My first mother had died in childbirth, and in some violent memory of that initiation into life, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  she may be the mother-country that had been lost in legend. But for me, the res of the dream remain as if they were not symbolic but primal res themselves of what was being expressed or shown."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>From a biographical perspective, the dream stems from the Pacific tides to which Duncan listened as a child of the Depression, "letting the crash of the surf take over and grow enormous in my mind which dwelt at times like this upon the last days of Atlantis, imagining again the falling of towers, the ruins of cities, the outcry of a populace swept under by the raging elements" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 86). After the death of his mother in childbirth, Duncan was adopted by theosophists, who exposed him to various world myths, including the legend of Atlantis. Prior to adopting Robert Duncan, his parents consulted the astrological charts of the Oakland Hermetic Brotherhood. "One thing predicted," biographer Ekbert Faas notes, "was that their future child had not been reincarnated since Atlantis and would embody the decadence of a civilization to be destroyed during his lifetime."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>From a psychological perspective, the Atlantis dream enacts a symbolic death and rebirth. It is a rite of participation, permission for the singular life to participate in the larger orders of mythopoeia. "Born in 1919 at the close of the War," Duncan relates, "I belonged, I had been told, to an Atlantean generation that would see once more last things and the destruction of a world" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 87). The first vision, then, is a vision of last things: earliest dreams and memories conflate the death of the mother, the mother country, and the end or edge of a continent.</p>
<p>Robert Duncan was born into an age of paradox: a time of modernity on the one hand and war and depression on the other. "The Depression years," Duncan writes, "ended all thought of the 'modern,' and still to come the Permanent War Economy in which the euphoria of the 1920s and the mystique of being 'modern' was swept away in the Age of Anxiety and the Beginning of Rage."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The poet enters into a world in which modernity is belatedness, "nostalgia for a world long gone" ("Self," 219). On a more personal level, the poet enters life as host to memories of personal and transpersonal birth trauma: the death of his mother in childbirth and the death of the "mother country" in Atlantis. In the Atlantis dream, there is recognition of life as derivative, an inheritance from the living and the dead. If Duncan's poetry is "derivative," it is by way of participation in myth: "these things that I did not originate but that came to me as an inheritance of what I was, a gift of life meanings."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Duncan's parents were practicing theosophists, the poet approached their hermetic beliefs "with a divided loyalty and suspicion," reading into its syncretism and utopian wishes the "economic individualism of the nineteenth-century American Protestant ethic and the Self-Cosmos . . . complexly interwoven in their origins" ("Self," 225–26). In a critique of theosophist Madame Blavatsky's ideas, for example, Duncan writes: "It was not a dogma nor was it a magic that I understood for myself in the theosophic world about me, but I understood that the meanings of life would always be, as they were in childhood, hidden away . . . a lasting fascination" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 86).</p>
<p>More than anything, it was theosophy's infusion of neo-platonic ideas that Duncan found problematic: a conflation of Protestant mistrust of image and ritual and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Plato's mistrust of the mythopoeic mind. Where theosophy differed from Protestant mistrust, however, was in the role of the priest. For Duncan's parents, "The myths of priests were true; the myths of poets were deceptively true" ("Truth," 4). Questions regarding the truth and falsehood of the mythopoeic are central to Duncan's ethos, and if, according to Plato, philosophy is "the only antidote to the fictions and illusions of Poetry," it is equally true that "the Dialogues of Plato are also stories, and the truth of a story is not rooted in wisdom but in the sense of the drama of life" (ibid). As in the poet's childhood memories of theosophical meetings, the drama of myth making is itself part of the message. Thus, the sickness of modern man, according to Duncan, lies in this tradition of casting out the poet who traffics in myth: "In a time when only one vision—the vision of an atomic disaster and the end of the species—haunts the world, in religion as well as in science, men labor to exorcize all the old stories. The spiritual and political promise of the day is that nothing will happen" (ibid., 5). The challenge for poetry, then, is to find "a structure that will be the complex story of all the stories felt to be true, a myth in which something like the variety of man's experience of what is real may be contained" (ibid., 6). Such a myth, if it speaks to reality, must be accountable to the origins of the real. For Duncan, that myth manifests itself in his Atlantis dream, which draws on the correspondence between individual trauma and collective catastrophe.</p>
<p>Commenting on Robert Duncan's utopian/dystopian poetic, Nathaniel Mackey argues that "the imagination of an other world is itself a judgment of this one, perhaps punishment as well as judgment, for it is impossible to imagine that other world without wanting to go there."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> "The imagination, the potential intellect," Mackey contends, "is intrinsically apocalyptic, inherently judgmental" (ibid., 212). But the correlation here between "the imagination of another world" and "wanting to go there"—the imagination and apocalypse—is too steeped in Christian eschatology and fails to consider that Duncan's view of the imagination was informed, among other things, by a Freudian agon between Eros (creation) and Thanatos (destruction). For Duncan, the imagination is less apocalyptic than metamorphic. One strand of metamorphosis in Duncan's work may be traced from the Atlantis dream to the poem "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," which recreates the dream not as a fulfillment of its apocalyptic narrative but as a creative vision of knowledge and power repressed within the dramatic narrative of the dream itself.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Atlantis Dream</h1>
<p>The interpretation of dreams runs the risk of over-determination: images stand in as symbols for everything, therefore nothing. And yet a dream image—like ideogram, rebus, or hieroglyph—may be interpreted as a complex of inter-related fields. For Duncan, convinced of psychoanalytic theory early on, the truth of dreams, like the truth of myth and the truth of waking life, is complex and mercurial.</p>
<p>The Atlantis dream is divided into three parts based on the primary images of the meadow, the dance, and the underworld king. This tripartite dream field originates <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in what is at once an actual meadow, the biological mother, the "mother country" of history and myth, and field of all fields—the cosmos itself. Among other things, the dancers may signify culture and community, and the king, authorship and authority. In Duncan's recounting of the dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H.D. Book</span>, the primal and the prophetic intersect: "a prediction of what life will be, now a showing forth of some content of what life is, as in the Orphic mysteries the story of Persephone was shown in scenes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 90). Important here is the Platonic notion that an idea is "a thing seen." An idea "is not something I have," Duncan notes, "but something that comes to me or appears to me" ("Truth," 20). Ideas are manifestations of latent meaning, a "showing forth of some content" that is somehow independent of the poet's volition (ibid.).</p>
<p>The Atlantis dream, part I:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>First there was the upward rise of a hill that filled the whole horizon of what was seen. A field of grass rippled as if by the life of the grass itself, yet I was told there was no wind. When I saw that there was no wind it was a fearful thing, where blade by blade the grass so bowed of its own accord to the West. The grass moved towards the left. The seer or dreamer then was facing north. There may have been flowers—day's eyes—the grass was certainly in flower. The field was alive and, pointing that way, across the rise of the hill to the West, gave a sign.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 89)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The field is all at once a dreamt field ("made up"), "a field of grass," and the cosmos itself. Unlike Dante's "<span style="font-style:italic;">selva oscura</span>" or Charles Olson's "cold hell, in thicket," the subject begins in a clearing. The dream itself is a clearing cultivated and wild, contained and open. But the narrative of the dream is unclear. Who tells the dreamer "there was no wind"? What is the agency behind the apodictic grass, bowing "of its own accord"? The scene is a still life: still and moving, living and dead. A willfulness or intelligence seems to emanate from within the field that "points the way," but if there is life in the field, it is veiled by its very "showing forth" in the sign of the grass itself. Moreover, the field is not only a thing seen but also a seeing thing ("day's eyes") that draws the dreamer away from the east, place of rising and rebirth, and toward west's cardinal point of death.</p>
<p>The field is familiar and yet strangely unfamiliar, imbued with a kind of animism that elicits the dreamer's "fearful" response. The scene is <span style="font-style:italic;">unheimlich</span> in Freud's sense of "that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar things."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Indeed, the dreamer is "fearful" and yet compelled by the grass that points the way. As a complex, the dream image, combining the familiar and the unfamiliar, gets around the censor, allowing for an expression or "showing forth" of a repressed wish. What is the repressed or latent dimension of the field? For Duncan, the dream is a return to a familiar, childhood field, "a place of first permission," as well as an expression of a repressed memory of Atlantis. The unmoved-moving grass triggers a repressed animism, which appears as some vitality submerged under the field. This notion of the return of the excluded or repressed—psychological, historical, mythological, linguistic, and political—is key to Duncan's vision of poetry as revelation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Compare the first scene of the Atlantis dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> to an earlier ver sion from a copy book entry dated July 1, 1962:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>First there was the upward rise of a hill that filled the whole horizon of the scene. A field of grass rippled as if by the life of the grass itself, for there was no wind while each blade bowed to the left or East. The seer or dreamer then was facing north. There may have been flowers, day's eyes—the grass was certainly in flower. The field was alive and, pointing that way, across the rise of the hill to the East gave a sign.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Was it a "scene" or something "seen"? Does the dreamer see there is no wind or is he "told" there is no wind? If told, then by whom? And does the flowering field point the way east or west? Although east-blowing grass reappears in the poem "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," if the dreamer is "facing north," then it stands to reason that the grass bowing to the left would bend to the west, not the east. Out of the weave of contrary testimonies, there may be no "first scene" but that each telling is a revision of a lost, original vision. Origin, then, involves contradiction's talking-againstone's self: a fabrication or making up. What one <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span>, is inextricably linked to fiction.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Led forth by the field, the scene shifts. Part II from <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Then, in a sudden almost blurred act of the play, there was a circle of children—sometimes they are all girls or all boys, sometimes they are boys and girls—dancing in the field. They choose or have chosen someone who is "IT" in the center of the ring, but I see no one there. The Dreamer is in the center, the "I" or Eye of the Dream. And just here, I realize that this "I" is my self and second that I have been "chosen," but also that in dreaming I am the Chosen One, I have been caught in the wrong—a "King" or victim of the children's round dance. Ring a round of roses. Pocket full of posies.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 89–90)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The natural/supernatural landscape yields to a civil/cultural landscape of children, dance, language, and play. In the first "act," the dreamer is chosen de facto by the dream itself: he "finds himself" in a field. Once again, he is chosen "in dreaming." However, the dreamer is also chosen by a singling out or singing out by the children in the ring. In the Atlantis dream, to be chosen is to be chosen for life (the subject suddenly appears on the meadow) and for death (the subject suddenly appears at the center of a ring, later substituted for a throne in the underworld). The "west bent" grass has pointed the dreamer in a counter- or sinister direction, and he is now "caught in the wrong."</p>
<p>The ambiguity in both scenes seems to emanate from a breakdown between cause and effect. In the first part of the dream, there is an effect (the grass moving by itself) without a cause; in the second part, there is a cause without an effect ("The children choose or have chosen someone who is 'IT' in the center of the ring, but I see no one there"). "IT" turns out to be the dreaming subject, so that his initial presence in the scene is a kind of blind "Eye of the Dream." The ambiguity of the moving grass appears to resolve itself, displaced onto the image of the round dance, but this only creates further ambiguity: there is "no one there" in the center of the ring. The dreamer's self-recognition ("this 'I' is my self"), in turn, may be the dream's attempt to resolve the ambiguity of the complex field-dance image. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The children's round dance amplifies a spatial conration of concentric rings latent in the first and final acts. In the first section, the dreamer stands in a kind of natural ring ("a hill that filled the whole horizon"), but the orientation implies that the dreamer is passive or detached from the field, because the action of the scene moves laterally and at a distance, as if projected onto a screen ("The grass moved towards the left"). Now, the dreamer (It/King) seems to enter the scene in earnest, standing within a series of concentric circles: a ring of children within a ring of field within a dream that is, in turn, inscribed within the world outside the dream. In other words, if the first scene is natural, projective, and linear—a showing forth or forward—then the second scene is culturally constructed, contained, and centripetal. The first scene connotes natural permission, whereas the second scene denotes a public choosing or pre-ordaining in which the subject plays no part. At the same time, it is in this second scene where the subject first refers to himself: a self-proposing, as it were, that would counter the children's singling-out.</p>
<p>The dreamer moves (or is moved) from the natural field of the meadow to the made-up field of the children's round dance, a turn and counter-turn within the larger round of the field itself. <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture</span> means "to turn," and this turning round the speaker proposes the dreamer not only as the subject of a natural scene but also the object of a culturally constructed scene. The dream-subject splits into degraded object ("IT") and exulted subject ("King"): "The Dreamer is in the center, the 'I' or Eye of the Dream. And just here, I realize that this 'I' is my self and second that I have been 'chosen,' but also that in dreaming I am the Chosen One." Circle dances reward community and punish individuality. The community is embodied in the dance, which in turn is the embodiment of the meadow and the song. To be singled out is to be "caught in the wrong," caught outside the song, and discovered by the meadow's covering song. To be "caught" is to be caught up in the fabric of the song and dance. As <span style="font-style:italic;">catch</span> can, it may "possess," "lay hold of" (<span style="font-style:italic;">hand's</span> "apprehend," <span style="font-style:italic;">mind's</span> "comprehend"), "ensnare," "charm," and "fascinate."</p>
<p>In both versions of the Atlantis dream, there is a split between first-person narration ("I") and dream imagery, on the one hand, and third-person narration ("The seer or dreamer," "someone," "Eye of the Dream") and dream thought, on the other. Duncan's approach to the dream-work as a language event operates as a verbal displacement also common in dreams: daisies become "day's eyes," "I" becomes "Eye of the Dream," and so on. As Freud notes, "a change of expression . . . assists dream-condensation even more directly, by finding a form of words which, owing to its ambiguity, is able to give expression to more than one of the dream-thoughts."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Of course, this sort of displacement and condensation appears in dream imagery as well, and in Duncan's dream, a unity of contraries appears in the shift from the meadow scene to the dance scene, where the secreted sentience or life force of the meadow is revealed in the composite image of children dancing on the meadow. Indeed, dreaming is itself a kind of doubling and division of the self into subject (the one who dreams) and object (the one who is dreamt). From a psychoanalytic perspective, both the prescribed and self-prescribed double identities of the dreamer allow him "to treat the rest of the ego like an object."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Self-recognition may also serve as a counter-spell of sorts to the children's spell, allow ing the dreamer to recast himself as "I" just as he is cast as IT/King.</p>
<p>In this second section of the dream, the act of being chosen destabilizes the dreaming subject: he is at once "I," "IT," and "King." In the dream-work of <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>, Duncan turns toward the ambiguity of the dream-language to present a deeper reading: "Pocket full of posies. Or is it poses? for I had been proposed or I had posed as King, posed myself there. Ashes, ashes. All fall down!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 90). The scene itself is play or make-believe: mimicking the round field in the round dance, the children transform into flowers, "a round of rosies," and the dreamer is transformed into "IT" and "King." Likewise, the ring shrinks in rhyme to a pocket full of posies, then disperses: "Ashes, ashes. All fall down!" The communal space forces displacement and condensation of the self as a transformation and a singling-out. In the rhyme of the ring, to "pose" is to propose destruction.</p>
<p>The dreamer is both more (King) and less (IT) himself. Likewise, the children's rhyme and round dance invite both creative multiplicity (e.g., metaphor: ring = rosies = children; metonymy: ring = pocketful of posies) and destructive exclusion (e.g., the dream-subject is singled out; all things have gone wrong). Here, Duncan uses the drift and play of language to present a complex of narrative associations: posies, poses, proposed. The dream's determination is a willful act, and the counter-spell of the children's play of posies is the profound consequence of being singled out. But even the proposal betrays a fictive, playful dimension: the dreamer stands in for the King; he poses. To come out of nature (the field) and into a community (the dancers) is to come belated to a made-up scene in which one is already "chosen." But the dream is also an act of selection, narration, ordaining. The ambivalence seems to stem in part from having come belated to the scene of the children's game. He arrives in a world already made, a community already "at play" in the making. Has the dreamer "proposed" himself as King or "posed" as King? The dreamer doubles as "Chosen One," or body double of the King.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> To be chosen is to be sacrificed, and in the ring and rhyme of posies, poses, proposed, one also hears intimations of the posed one's dark deposing.</p>
<p>From the <span style="font-style:italic;">Copy Book Entries</span>, here is the earlier version of the second scene of the Atlantis dream:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Then in a sudden, almost blurred, act of the play, there was a ring of children—sometimes they are all girls, sometimes there are boys and girls—dancing in the field. They have chosen someone who is "it" in the center, but no one appears there. The Dreamer is in the Center, the "I"—and first here I realize first that this "I" is myself and second that I am a king or victim, and that in dreaming that I am the king or victim with the circle of dancing children.</p>
<p>Ring around of roses</p>

<p>All fall down . . .</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CBE</span>, unpaginated) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The differences between the two versions of this section of the dream are based less on puns and contrary images than an attempt in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> to locate agency in the dreamer, as well as to draw out a more complex sense of cause and effect: "choose or have chosen" vs. "They have chosen"; "I see no one there" vs. "no one appears there"; "the 'I' or Eye of the Dream" vs. "the 'I'"; "I am the Chosen One, I have been caught in the wrong" vs. "I am a king or victim," and so on.</p>
<p>The final section of the Atlantis dream, from <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>In the third part—but it is the second section of the dream, for the Field and Its Dancers are two parts belonging to the one section—I am shown a cavern underground. A throne room? There is a stone chair on a dais. Seeing it is the King's chair or, even, in some dreamings of this dream, finding myself a lonely King in that chair, there is no one rightly there. A wave of fear seizes me. All things have gone wrong and I am in the wrong. Great doors break from their bars and hinges, and, under pressure, a wall of water floods the cavern.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 90)</div>

<p class="continued">And as it appears in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Copy Book Entries</span>:</p>

<p class="continued">From open meadow to closed underworld, there is a downward projection, an introjection, though it is unclear who or what leads the subject down toward what is shown. An off-stage character also res in the first scene, though conspicuously absent from the middle or "eye" of the dream, where the children are present. Also worth noting is that this unseen character leads the subject toward a revelation about the chthonic underside of the field and the central absence of agency (e.g., no wind, an empty throne).</p>
<p>This final section of the dream reveals the bowing grass in the first scene and the dancers in the second scene as leading the dreamer toward his own death and presumably the destruction of the meadow. The ring of the field and the ring of children act as fates, singling out the one who would father forth last things. But the King is a sacrificial king. He is inverted and fathers forth nothing. If there is symbolic rebirth, it is only through total destruction. The sacrifice of the king and the sacrifice of the underworld kingdom (the flooding of Atlantis) return, or turn back, to the first law of nature. The grass and round dance act as agents showing forth a primal or first law latent in the composite of images.</p>
<p>In one sense, the dream is a showing forth of the subject within the primary or archetypal contexts of nature, culture, and death, and it is possible, of course, to map onto these mother, peers/siblings, and father. It is also possible to conceive of the three scenes as ages of the dreamer: childhood, adulthood, and old age. But if the dream is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  primarily narcissistic, it is worth noting the ambiguity (and in some cases, absence) of agency or centering image in each scene, which elicits a fearful or foreboding tone: the invisible, chthonic force that moves the grass; the absent Chosen One at the center of the ring; the vacant King's chair. For Duncan, the center of the dream and the center of the poem are not comprised of narcissistic images but an elusive otherness that both the dreamer and the poet must realize:</p>

<p>It is in the dream itself that we seem entirely creatures, without imagination, as if moved by a plot or myth told by a story-teller who is not ourselves. Wandering and wondering in a foreign land or struggling in the meshes of a nightmare, we cannot escape the compelling terms of the dream unless we wake, anymore than we can escape the terms of our living reality unless we die.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 89)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">To escape is to wake is to die. Duncan infers a fascinating distinction here between the ontology of the dreaming subject and the ontology of the waking subject. If the poet must have "a likeness to the dreamer of the dream and to the creator of our living reality," then the poem must heed the realities of both life and death (ibid.).</p>
<p>What is most revealing about the dream remains concealed or revealed only in absentia: the mother. Although she is absent from the above narrative, her re is central in subsequent poems that re-vision the Atlantis dream. In Duncan's commentary following the narrative of the Atlantis dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>, the scenes reveal not only an ambivalent and doomed patriarch but also a matriarchal voice of prophecy:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The restless dead, the impending past life, what had been cast away—a seed—sprouts and in the vital impulse would speak to us. The head of a giant woman rises from the ground. "<span style="font-style:italic;">I have seen Kore</span>," the initiate Heracles says: "<span style="font-style:italic;">What face more terrible?" "I am initiate, prepared for Hades</span>." Wonder and terror seem to be signs of the rite. But in my life dream, I have not seen the Maiden, for I stand in her place or in her way.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 90; italics in the original)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">In her place or in her way: repressed, occulted, "wandering in quest of something known in the unknown," the poet is led forth into "wonder and terror" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 103). From birth to initiation, so begin first obstructions and first permissions.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Eleusis</h1>
<p>Duncan's dream analysis in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> grafts a myth of resurrection—the Eleusinian Mysteries—onto the apocalyptic narrative of the Atlantis dream, suggesting that the "wonder and terror" of the dream have to do most with what is not seen: the <span style="font-style:italic;">visio beatifica</span> of the Kore. Although both the rape of Persephone (Kore) in the Eleusinian Mysteries and the destruction of the city in the Atlantis myth originate in transgression, the theme of revival, or at least partial revival, occurs only in the former. Revision is revival: the dream-work is to the dream as Eleusis is to Atlantis. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In the dream-work, Duncan contrasts his failed vision with the heroic re of Heracles who has "seen the face of Kore." But the poet is mercurial here: this is the Heracles of the Milan Papyrus, which reverses the chronology of the Greek hero's initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries and descent into Hades. Having already seen the face of the Kore, what need is there for dramatic revision? From the "Speech of Herakles": "I was initiated long ago [or: elsewhere]. Lock up Eleusis, [Hierophant,] and put the fire out . . . Deny me the holy night! I have already been initiated into more authentic mysteries. . . . [I have beheld] the fire, whence [. . . and] I have seen the Kore."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Heracles makes a crucial distinction here between "authentic" vision (descent into the underworld) and dramatic revision (the Eleusinian rituals). Is there an authentic vision of the Kore in Duncan's dream? Unless we correlate authenticity with substitutive images, there is no authentic vision. What is seen: terrestrial veils of a meadow, a round dance, and a king. What is seen is blindness, the authorial veil of the seeing "I." If there is a vision in the dream-work, it is tantamount to the torch-bright belatedness of the Eleusinian "holy night": derivative, dramatic, fictive.</p>
<p>No one knows what the Eleusinian Mysteries revealed, though we know the cult at Eleusis was devoted to worshipping Demeter, goddess of grain and agriculture, and her daughter, Persephone. Such worship of vegetation goddesses goes back to the roots of agrarian culture in the Neolithic period. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Homeric Hymn to Demeter</span> tells us that the Eleusinian Mysteries were based on Plouton's (Hades) rape of Persephone and Demeter's subsequent wandering in search of her daughter: transgression, counter-transgression (searching), and restoration. There are various interpretations, though most common is the belief that the myth recounts relationships between the eternal cycle of nature and the historical origins of culture (cultivation). The Eleusinian myth, of course, posits cultural origins not only in nature but also in divine nature, and the rituals at Eleusis were most likely a reenactment of Persephone's descent into and ascent from the underworld. Perhaps most important to both the Eleusinian Mysteries and Duncan's Atlantis dream, is that they center on a vision that is feminine. As Kerényi stresses in his analysis of the myth, the Eleusinian Mysteries "opened up a vision of the <span style="font-style:italic;">feminine source of life</span>. . . just as the ear of grain had opened up a vision into the 'abyss of the seed'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 147, emphasis in original).</p>
<p>There are numerous parallels between Duncan's Atlantis dream and the myth of Demeter/Persephone, so much so that the poet could very well have called it the Eleusinian dream. Both narratives begin in a flowering field alive with chthonic powers. In his analysis of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Homeric Hymn to Demeter</span>, Kerényi states that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nysion pedion</span>, the Nysan Plain, was a meadow: "the divine marriage of Plouton and Kore was celebrated on 'the Meadow,' and the underworld deities were worshipped in a nearby cave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 34). "Flowery meadows," N.J. Richardson observes in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Homeric Hymn to Demeter</span>, "play a prominent part in underworld topography."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> In his catalog of flowers as gateways to the underworld, Richardson singles out the narcissus: "It is a miraculous flower . . . and when [Persephone] reaches out her hands to pick it, the earth gapes and Hades leaps forth. This suggests that the flower is a kind of 'Open Sesame,' a common motif in folk-stories, in which the magic flower is the key that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  opens the earth, revealing the underworld and its hidden treasures" (ibid., 144). Not unlike the "day's eyes" of daisies in Duncan's dream meadow, for the ancient Greeks, the "golden color [of the narcissus] aptly symbolized the underworld" (ibid.). There are other parallels between the myth and the dream, including the fact that both involve wandering (exile) or being led forth, and both have an intermediary chorus leading the subject into the underworld.</p>
<p>In the Atlantis dream, the subject seems to assume both the role of Persephone, the one who descends, and the role of Demeter, the one who wanders. A biographical reading of the dream would reveal at least a partial inversion of the myth, whereby the dream subject takes on the role of the mother (Demeter) in search of her lost child (Persephone). In other words, the subject is both mother and child. Such a reading might then posit the subject's blindness as a way of partially blocking this inversion, which is complicated all the more by the fact that Duncan's mother died in childbirth.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Myesis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Epopteia</span>
</h1>
<p>Mircea Eliade cites several Orphic (i.e., later) hypotheses on the content of the Great Mysteries. Foucart, for example, working off the Orphic testimony, "considered that the rituals . . . involved a peregrination in darkness, various terrifying apparitions, and the sudden entrance of the mystes into a lighted meadow."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedo</span>, Plato suggests that the Orphic Mysteries go back to Egyptian funerary customs. According to Kerényi, the drama at Eleusis was divided into the Lesser Mysteries (<span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span>) and the Great Mysteries (<span style="font-style:italic;">epopteia</span>). The Lesser Mysteries:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Myesis</span> can be rendered by the Latin word <span style="font-style:italic;">initia</span>, "beginnings," or its derivative <span style="font-style:italic;">initiatio</span>, or initiation, signifying introduction into the secret. For <span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span> comes from the verb <span style="font-style:italic;">myeo</span> . . . which denotes the action. The simpler verb <span style="font-style:italic;">myo</span> . . . , from which the noun derives, implies the element of secrecy. It means nothing other than "to close," as the eyes do after seeing. The self-evident first object of this verb is the subject itself: he closes himself after the manner of a flower. But a second object is also possible, which must be very close to the subject, his very own possession. Such an object is the secret. In German this close connection between the secret and the beholder of the secret is expressed by the derivation of the noun <span style="font-style:italic;">Geheimnis</span> (secret) and the adjective <span style="font-style:italic;">heimlich</span> (secret) from <span style="font-style:italic;">Heim</span> (home), the most private precinct.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 46)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">According to this etymology, the occult vision of initiation is paradoxical: seeing is not-seeing, opening is closing, possession is dispossession, and so on. Duncan's dream-work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> can be thought of as <span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span>, a self-reflexive closure that discloses what is not shown in the actual dream. As noted earlier, the scenes of the Atlantis dream are both familiar and unfamiliar, a "wonder and terror" that resonates with Freud's notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">das unheimlich</span> as both <span style="font-style:italic;">vernaculus</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">occultus</span>, "familiar" and "concealed."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">As the eyes do . . . after the manner of a flower</span>: the disclosure of otherness begins with the closure of the self. The dream initiates an open secret, what Kerényi calls the "second object." The <span style="font-style:italic;">volta face</span> of Duncan's dream-work, turning back toward <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the dream, is a sort of doubling closure, showing forth the absent re of the dream (the secret/Kore) who is concealed both in the dream narrative ("I have not seen the Maiden") and as the dreaming narrator ("I stand in her place or in her way").</p>
<p>In the subterranean chamber of the Atlantis dream, a king, a king's symbol of power ("the King's chair"), and finally, in some versions of the narrative, the dreaming/seeing subject ("myself a lonely King in that chair") substitute for the Kore. The king is final avatar of the Kore, or more accurately, avatar in absentia along a chain of substitutions. To stand "in her place or in her way" implies that the speaker's own presence in the dream has blocked the narrative from developing into the second stage of initiation, <span style="font-style:italic;">epopteia</span>, "the state of 'having seen.'" According to Duncan's dream-work, if the absent re of the Kore is "[t]he restless dead, the impending past life, what had been cast away," then what is occluded in the dream is a vision of "the vital impulse" of the dead.</p>
<p>The Atlantis dream is an incomplete initiation, a partial "showing forth" that is blocked by the seeing subject. Indeed, the very fact of the dream's repetition implies a lack of resolution and revelation—the full disclosure of "the state of 'having seen.'" And yet, if the dreaming subject stands in the place of the Kore (symbolic substitution) or in her way (literal obstruction), then Duncan is shown himself <span style="font-style:italic;">as Kore</span>. In other words, he is both the subject and the object of the dream, the secret and the beholder of the secret. But the dream-work reveals that each revelation in the dream, each avatar of the Kore, is a substitution in a chain of substitutions that ends in terror and destruction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the dream-work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> serves as an intermediary vision of the Kore between the Atlantis dream as initiation (<span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span>, or "introduction into the secret") and the poet's initiation into poetry as revelation (<span style="font-style:italic;">epopteia</span>, or "the state of having seen"). Taken together, the Atlantis dream, the dream-work, and the poem "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow" operate as a rite of participation in which repressed realities are shown forth. And for the Freudian poet, what is important is not only what is revealed in the dream but what remains concealed. Unlike the Heracles of the Milan Papyrus, drama is not merely derivation but <span style="font-style:italic;">dromenon</span>, deed, "a thing done." The drama of poetry: authentic vision as total composition in which the imagination participates in a complex of what is personal and transpersonal, "made" and "made-up."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow"</h1>
<p>Although the Atlantis dream surfaces in several of Robert Duncan's poems, the fullest treatment of the dream appears in "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," the opening poem in what many consider to be the poet's first mature book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Opening of the Field</span>.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Like the Atlantis dream, the poem opens with a vision of a meadow. Unlike the dream-work, the poem isn't merely a recounting of the dream or its latent ideas. As Michael Davidson points out, "the poem as field does not imitate but enacts natural and cosmic orders: it does not seek to 'contain' meaning but to discover immanent <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  meanings."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, as the earlier dream-work illustrates, each discovery is also a re-covering of meaning. There are, most certainly, both contained meanings and immanent meanings in the poem, and it is the interplay between covering and re-covering that is most vital.</p>
<p>The first meadow opens as a poem and shuts as a door. As it appears in a letter from London to the poet Helen Adam (1 February 1956):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Often I am permitted to return to a meadow<br>that is not mine, but is a made place<br>—as if the mind made it up—a poem.</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Two days later, Duncan is reading Ezra Pound's <span style="font-style:italic;">Rock Drill</span> Cantos as both a "prayer for compassion" and "a falsification." "Yes, a falsification," he writes to the poet Denise Levertov. "It is only when the voice in writing lifts into the language itself speaking that the truth of the made-thing presides. The feeling of what is false for me is the evident <span style="font-style:italic;">use</span> of language to persuade."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Duncan's trouble with Pound's falsifications reveals to him a falsification in his own work. As in the Atlantis dream and dream-work, there is a primary connection made between the evident and the false. Similar to Heracles's distinction between urge and demiurge, act and reenactment, truthfulness resides in "language itself speaking" versus the subject's "<span style="font-style:italic;">use</span> of language to persuade." To press forward by persuasion is to remain unmoved. Two years later, Duncan and Levertov are engaged in a long exchange concerning vision and revision:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I've found myself sweating over extensive rehaulings on the opening poem ["Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow"] of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Field</span> . . . I mistrust the rationalizing mind that comes to the fore, and must suffer thru—like I did when I was just beginning twenty years ago—draft after draft to exhaust the likely and reach the tone in myself where intuition begins to move. It comes sure enuf then, the hand's feel that "this" is what must be done. But I spent two days struggling with "Sometimes I am Permitted . . ." (with all the irony of the reference in the poem to the grace of the writing at all).</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>, 131)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Sometimes/Often: these "rehaulings" call into question the authenticity of original vision. Revision implies division, diminution, lost integrity. What is at stake here is what <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Duncan calls the "moral urgency" of poetry (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>, 131). The "evident use of language to persuade" is not only uninspired; it is immoral. "In the full enchantment of art," he writes, "fiction has the depth and lastingness as a real experience that actuality has only in events of like creative participation. Yet in the failure of that creative immediacy, we will come to feel that the story is not true to itself" ("Truth," 13–14). Arguably, in the Atlantis dream there is no such "creative participation"; instead, the subject of the dream stands in the way. If to "exhaust the likely" is to achieve integrity in the poem, then Duncan's revision of "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow" is also a radical revision of the Atlantis dream as imbued with the virtue of first things.</p>
<p>The first few stanzas as they appear in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Opening of the Field</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<h1 class="sec-headA">Often I am Permitted to Return to a Meadow</h1>
<div class="verse-group"><p>as if it were a scene made-up by the mind,<br>that is not mine, but is a made place,</p></div>

<div class="verse-group"><p>that is a made place, created by light<br>wherefrom the shadows that are forms fall.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">As revision of a primal scene, the poem returns to the dream's antediluvian meadow: a "made" coherence that precedes both the poem's remaking and the flood's unmaking of the field. An enabling conceit lies couched in the humility of the title. As a permitted act, the poem is both an invocation of an original scene (Atlantis dream) and a provocation of the speech act as derivation—a drama "made-up by the mind" that allows the poet to reenter the field of the dream as the field of the poem. In the opening tercet of the draft to Helen Adam, the meadow image recedes behind twin artifices of the maker's "mind" and "poem." As such, it repeats the rational operative of the dream-work: Kore is to meadow as mind/poem is to meadow. Whereas the first draft of the meadow poem attempts to resolve this ambivalence by overtly substituting the poem for the meadow, the revised poem returns the meadow to its original ambivalence as both a "made" and a "made-up" place. The self-conscious correlation between meadow and poem drops out.</p>
<p>"Made-up" and "made," the meadow is all at once derivative and primary. It is "mine" and "not mine," "as if . . . made-up by the mind" and "a made place // . . . near to the heart." A homophonic pun registers below the surface of the meadow as "maid place" of the Kore. The "made place" is engendered female and opposite what is "made-up": the pretend place of the male subject whose return would remake the meadow in his own image. The spatial conration of the maid below the meadow in the Atlantis dream takes on a more temporal aspect as antecedent to the poem. In the dream, the "maiden" is unseen but intimated in the rippling field of grass pointing toward the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  underworld. The return in the dream to a made/maid place is derivative, implying falsification and subterfuge: "all things have gone wrong."</p>
<p>The overt correlation between meadow and poem in the first draft is subtly intimated with a stanza break in the revision. Instead of returning to the refrain ("Often I am permitted"), the stanza break between couplet and tercet emphasizes the difficulty in locating the meadow "that is not mine, but is a made place // that is mine, it is so near to the heart." As Duncan states in his preface to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ground Work: Before the War</span>, caesuras are "not just an articulation of phrasings but a phrase itself of silence. Space between stanzas becomes a stanza-verse of silence: in which the beat continues."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> In other words, the absence of language is not the absence of measure; instead, the caesural turn registers as possession within language (a phrase of silence) and dispossession outside of language (a silent phrasing).</p>
<p>It is impossible to say for certain where speaker and meadow exist in relation to one another. As "a scene made-up by the mind," "near to the heart," and "an eternal pasture," the meadow (i.e., poem) is all at once inside and outside the speaker. If <span style="font-style:italic;">permitted</span> means "sent forth" and <span style="font-style:italic;">return</span> "sent back," then permission to return implies a paradoxical motion of being sent back and forth all at once. A return by definition is displacement from an original time or place. To return, then, is to participate in a fabricated or "made-up" origin. The field is folded upon contrary propositions, imitating the folding of the field itself. But the permission of the title implies that the poem's return to a meadow is motivated not by the speech act per se but by someone (or something) whose permission precedes the poem. Permission to return to a meadow, therefore, participates in a scene prior to the beginning of the poem and the movement of language itself.</p>
<p>In Duncan's Atlantis poem, off rhymes (mind/mine, made/place, thought/hall, and so on), homophonic puns (seen/scene, made/maid), and assonance and alliteration (made-up/mind/mine; heart/hall; forms/fall, and so on) imitate the peristaltic motion of "going forth" and "turning back." To listen to the poem is to hear all at once the shuttle of likeness (permission) and difference (retraction). For example, the consonant chain "made-up," "mind," "mine," and "made": each rhyme and off rhyme acts as a kind of acoustic turn (difference of vowels) and return (likeness of consonants). Likewise, clausal enjambments run interference between declaratives, enfolding each image in its contrary, "as if it were a scene made-up by the mind / that is not mine, but is a made place // that is mine, it is so near to the heart." The contrary movement of language and images tends to assert, erase, then reassert relationships between subject and object, speaker and meadow, re and field.</p>
<p>The next several stanzas extend the folded topography of the meadow to include not only the speaker's body but an interior, constructed space ("a hall therein") that contrasts with the natural, "made" surface of the meadow. Making (remaking?) the meadow posits a complex relationship between interiors and exteriors, origins and derivations, the speaker and the "First Beloved":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Wherefrom fall all architectures I am<br>I say are likenesses of the First Beloved<br>whose flowers are flames lit to the Lady. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>She it is Queen Under The Hill<br>whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words<br>that is a field folded.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">("Often," 7)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">It is tempting to say that one image telescopes into another, but each image actually falls away like scaffolding in order to reveal a deeper image. The meadow, "created by light," casts the speaker in relief as "shadows that are forms," which are, in turn, "all architectures I am." These "architectures" are "likenesses of the First Beloved" and correspond with the "hall" of the second stanza. The First Beloved appears to surface here, but the image is convoluted. The meadow, "folded in all thought," proposes an interior that is artificial, constructed in concentricities of likeness.</p>
<p>Cary Nelson notes that the meadow "seems almost an imaginary <span style="font-style:italic;">hortus conclusus</span>, an enclosed garden protected from the outside world."<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Indeed, the mental ("mind") aspect of the meadow seems to portray this place as hermetic, interior, and convoluted, implying a topography contrary to the projective connotation of an opening of the field. But Duncan is a Freudian poet, and equating "enclosed" with "protected" evades the complexities of repressed realities that surface dynamically within the poem. This is, after all, not an enclosing of the field but an opening of the field. Nelson's <span style="font-style:italic;">hortus conclusus</span> holds true only if we restrict the spatial economy of the meadow to a latitudinal model. What is repressed inside/under the meadow is not "protected from the outside" but disclosed by what is concealed in the speaker's "mind": the "made place" of the poem, the subterranean, "words within words," "return" as temporal transgression (e.g., memory, history), and so on. Indeed, both "permission" and "return" imply less of a <span style="font-style:italic;">conclusus</span> than an <span style="font-style:italic;">inclusus</span>, a folding-in or folding-back on what is exterior and anterior to the place and time of the meadow.</p>
<p>Duncan's dream-work recalls that in the Atlantis dream, "there was the upward rise of a hill that filled the whole horizon of what was seen" (HD, 89). Etymological substrata turn up "concealment" and "possession" in the roots of <span style="font-style:italic;">upward, hill</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">horizon. Healdan</span> is "to hold, retain." A horizon (<span style="font-style:italic;">horos</span>) is a boundary. A child's perspective? There is something grotesquely disproportionate about the hill filling "the whole horizon of what was seen," as if the spatial ratios of re (hill) and field (sky) were transposed. But from a mythological or psychological perspective, ratio and scale are proportionate, the field tumescent with what life force lies concealed or repressed within it. This weird topography reappears in the poem not as an upward rise but as folding and stratification into surface and interior. At the same time, the topography lends a sense of latitude and circularity to the meadow, which is picked up later in the children's "ring a round of roses."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Each line of the poem moves forward by circling backward. The "fall" of "shadows"/"forms" picks up in the fourth stanza as "architectures" that are "likenesses of the First Beloved," just as the preceding "shadows" are likenesses of "a made place, created by light." Qualifying conjunctions ("that") between noun clauses move the imagery forward, at the same time mysteriously enfolding the labyrinthine logic of each scene back on itself. The speaker equates "all architectures I am" with "likenesses of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the First Beloved," whose lit flowers, like Dante's anti-images, foreground the re of the Lady, illuminating her brighter image.</p>
<p>Kore, <span style="font-style:italic;">Kardia, cor</span>: as <span style="font-style:italic;">catches</span> they are charms, guerdons, cordials "so near to the heart," they do not repel death but impel the meadow that gives birth not only to life (First Beloved) but also to death (Queen Under The Hill). Taken as a dream's dark flowers, they are posies posed "as King." Given as a poem's bright cordial, they are "flames lit to the Lady." In "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," poses propose permission, the original proposition that places the speaker in the meadow of the poem. Indeed, in all of Duncan's poetry there are leads in misleadings, hearings in mishearings, so that like the Gnostic, mistrust becomes a force as generative as trust.</p>
<p>At the middle line of the middle stanza, we seem to pass into the interior of the meadow and the meadow poem. A kind of outrider, it is the longest line of the poem. If we think of the meadow as a language event, then these "words within words" are also our deepest penetralia into the made meadow itself. The formal and visual awkwardness of the line demonstrates "a disturbance of words" that resists containment. The flower-flames link the "First Beloved" to "the Lady," who is also "Queen Under The Hill." The field is enfolded in "a disturbance of words within words," not unlike the poem itself which resonates with a surplus of meaning in alliterations, off-rhymes, and puns.</p>
<p>The third movement of the poem returns to the surface of the meadow, retracting the metaphorical and chthonic dimensions:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>It is only a dream of the grass blowing<br>east against the source of the sun<br>in an hour before the sun's going down</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>whose secret we see in a children's game<br>of ring a round of roses told.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">("Often," 7)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">It: the meadow? the poem? We are once again on the meadow or in the dream of a meadow versus under it, the "words within words" of a folded field rered as "only a dream of the grass blowing." It is a simple thing, a play of surfaces like "a children's game / of ring a round of roses told." The phrasing is reminiscent of the familial voice, reassuring the waking child that "it is only a dream." However, the tone here is not soothing but sinister. What do we "wake from"? If a "return to a meadow" is a return to the Atlantis dream, then to assert that the meadow is "only a dream" isn't to "unfold" but instead fold it once more back into itself—a kind of dream within a dream, a double-dream. The unfamiliar (dream) and the familiar (meadow scene) strangely transpose, as if the speaker were calling to us to wake from the speech act into the "dream of the grass blowing / east against the source of the sun." To wake is to die.</p>
<p>Although the speaker's tone and diction imply a diminution of the meadow, the image superimposes the meadow and the round dance that appear as separate scenes in the Atlantis dream. The round dance turns within (under?) a terrestrial circle (the meadow) inscribed within a solar circle. The children's game seems to counter the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  east-to-west solar movement, their round dance returning like the grass that turns "against the source of the sun." In the Atlantis dream, the grass "bowed of its own accord to the West." Here, the grass isn't bowed to the West but blowing to the East, "the source of the sun." One hears, too, "the source of the <span style="font-style:italic;">son</span>" symbolically red in the East as origin: a "first place," a mothering meadow. If there is a "secret" in the round dance, its orientation is sinister. Indeed, the vision is oriented to the ancient notion of the sun's subterranean return from its death in the West to rise once more in the East. As "a return to a meadow" implies, the poem bears such sinister orientation. Although there is no explicit relationship between fold and circle, both patterns complicate the topographical metaphor of "returning," since folding ("words within words") and circling ("round of roses told") retrace the prescribed field.</p>
<p>Who are these children whose round game holds the secret to the "dream of the grass"? As hosts imitating the moving grass, they are to the meadow as "a disturbance of words" is to The Queen Under The Hill. The word <span style="font-style:italic;">host</span> itself contains a host of contrary meanings: "guest" and "keeper of guests"; as parasite (<span style="font-style:italic;">parasitos</span>), "one who sits at the table (body) of another." Of course, the host is also spiritual parasite of the body (e.g., victim, sacrifice, recompense), and in the body politic, the belly of a wooden horse swarming with the <span style="font-style:italic;">parasitos</span> of Greek soldiers smuggled into Troy: a gift, a guest, a harbinger of death. By all accounts, <span style="font-style:italic;">host</span> signifies a blurring of boundaries between inside and outside, interior and surface. In Duncan's meadow poem, "words within words" are "hosts" to the Queen: a "field folded" and maid of words.</p>
<p>Like the spell and counter-spell of the children's round dance, the poem returns to the fact of first lines, first permissions and propositions, signaling a return to the beginning of the poem. The children's round dance, turning and returning at the surface of the field, correlates with the "disturbance of words within words," turning and turning up the denotative surface of language. The very turning of the round dance signifies both the permission of the poem and the secrecy of the dream enfolded in the meadow. Although the children's round dance seems to turn contrary to the "forward moving" sun, it also turns the poem forward as catalyst or chorus. Turning forward and backward, the reader is asked to hold in mind each preceding image. The "secret we see" reveals the meadow in miniature as "a children's game." That is, the "made-up" circle of the round dance inscribed within the "made" circle of the meadow. The "secret" is also a foretelling of the destruction of Atlantis in the children's rhyme of "ring a round of roses": <span style="font-style:italic;">Ashes, ashes, all fall down</span>. If there is anxiety in the dance and the dream, it is red just here in the rhyme that builds, round and round, toward its own falling down. To dance is to draw out, and in the Atlantis dream the dance draws out the subject as "Chosen One," ushering in the destruction of the meadow. If the children's round dance imitates or reenacts the creation of the meadow, then in both the Atlantis dream and the meadow poem, the dance acts as a kind of demiurge: artistry is derivative, made-up, fallen. And in the Gnostic tradition, the demiurge is evil: artistry is counter-turn (return) against the original turn of creation. Likewise, the "disturbance of words within words" may imply not only a turning-up of buried or repressed meanings within the host of each word, but also the notion that each construction contains within itself the seed of its own destruction. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Unlike the Atlantis dream, however, the poem's round dance returns us to the meadow:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Often I am permitted to return to a meadow<br>as if it were a given property of the mind<br>that certain bounds hold against chaos,</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>that is a place of first permission,<br>everlasting omen of what is.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(ibid.)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The refrain links a formal return in the poem to a kind of magical repossession of the meadow vision as "bound" within both the poem and the speaker, "a given property of the mind" that would "hold against chaos." In this sense, the meadow-as-artifice encloses. Ideas are images—properties of the phenomenal world. But permission and property pull the poem in opposite directions. Do "certain bounds hold against chaos" because of the permission bestowed upon the speaker? Are these "certain bounds" the mind, the mind's image of the meadow, or the meadow itself? And does <span style="font-style:italic;">certain</span> mean "particular," "fixed," or "true"? The poem's oscillating motion seems to arrest itself here in the declarative of an origin in omen, not only of the meadow but also of the poem itself as "everlasting omen of what is." But an omen does not reveal "what is"; it reveals what has yet to be. Ultimately, this "place of first permission" and "everlasting omen of what is" isn't explicitly revealed. This "given property," then, may be thought of as permission's liberating constraint. Mind/mined: a pun joins the mental and the physical, the labor of the mind given over to what is mined: a mental georgic, a labor in and of the field.</p>
<p>Between "certain bounds" and "chaos," "everlasting omen" and "what is," Robert Duncan's "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow" proposes that we do not progress in dream or poem but ceaselessly evolve within a matrix of creation and destruction, history and prophecy. For the Heracles of the Eleusinian mysteries, dramatic enactment was "less authentic." For Duncan, authenticity and authority in the dramatic creation of poetry stem from not only the author's authenticity but also the authority of myth. Indeed, the poem is simultaneously a remembering of the Kore and a dismembering of the speaker's ego that would, as king, depose her. And if she res as words, then to remember the Kore is permission for the poem to stand in the place of the poet's ego, marking a passage between the vision of a dream and the revision of a poem.</p>

The high horizon line seems to fold the field back on the viewer as it mounts the sky. Duncan wanted his partner Jess to decorate the cover of the book.

The field in Jess's mixed-media rendition is more linear and flat than the cover photograph, but the letter-festooned tree and sky, as well as the photograph of children dancing in a circle, lend a sense of playfulness to the collage, which of course is central to Duncan's vision of the field. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
