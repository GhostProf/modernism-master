<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When is power foreign? Is it only so in colonies, penal or otherwise,
or is it always somehow the case? Do we accept authority more readily
when its foundations evade our comprehension, when something other than
reason encourages us to submit? And if, indeed, it is the Law's startling
senselessness that compels us to accept official meanings, does not this
dimension also open the way to unexpected appropriations? The failure of
sense may well lead to the making of sense--and yet, could this failure
not provide a point of convergence that would lead not to subjection
but to the reproduction of alternative social worlds?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Franz Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" invites such speculation. A traveler,
an explorer from a distant land, visits a penal colony where he is invited
to witness an execution. The officer in charge of the maintenance and
enforcement of judicial matters shows him the lethal apparatus, which
inscribes the violated commandment on the condemned man's flesh. A
soldier, the only other person in attendance, straps the condemned man
to the apparatus. The execution is about to begin, when the condemned man
vomits, sickened perhaps by the sweets fed to him by the new commander's
ladies, perhaps by the repulsive felt stump placed in his mouth to prevent
him from screaming. The mishap drives the officer to a tirade in which he
begs the traveler to help him defend this system of justice. The traveler
refuses; although he is touched by the officer's devotion, he finds the
procedure inhumane; if anything, the officer's appeal persuades him that
he has the influence to intervene. The traveler's unwillingness to

<B></B>

defend the apparatus compels the officer to make a fateful
decision. Having freed the prisoner and readjusted the machine to
inscribe his own judgment--"Be just"--the officer removes his clothing;
the condemned man and the soldier strap him down; and the machine silently
starts working. But then, quite literally, things fall apart, and the
exquisite torture the officer desired is reduced to "full-blown murder."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  After burying the officer and visiting the Old Commandant's grave,
  the traveler leaves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story suggests--even insists upon--the foreign character of
power. Agents of justice are recognized as possessing qualities that place
them at a remove from local politics, from the realm of comprehensible
meanings, from conscious thought, from life itself. Take the protagonist,
"a great researcher of Western Civilization" (at least to some) whose
refusal to endorse the officer's position leads directly to the latter's
self-righteous self-condemnation. He is a foreigner of a classically
anthropological, even imperial sort: he visits, he observes, he refrains
from intervening. Assuming neutrality gives him all the more authority to
transform local practices. He is not unlike the high colonial reformers
of the period, who stood in judgment of the humanity of native customs
that their predecessors had preserved or, more commonly, invented.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Even the most soft-spoken commentary will provide ammunition for those
  who wish to defend the traditional system or consign it to the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Then there is the system itself and the apparatus that instantiates
it, the work of the dead commander. Where the traveler is foreign in
relation to the penal colony as a whole, the judicial system is foreign
in relation to the condemned. The condemned man has not had a chance
to defend himself; he does not even know that he has been accused. The
officer explains the procedure in French, a language the condemned man
"presumably" does not understand ("IPC" 194). An encounter with a foreign
tongue always foregrounds the problematically material character of
social discourse--the qualities that make language something more (and
less) than a vehicle for communicating ideas. The apparatus that is used
to carry out the sentence also brings these material qualities to the
fore. The apparatus is textual in multiple senses. It works by writing
an elaborated script that can only be "read" through the body. Beginning
with the skin--an intimate interface between an interior and the outside
world--the condemned man's flesh is the focus of the justice served. One
also gauges the effects of the procedure by reading a surface: the
"glow" that radiates from the dying man's face. Through writing,
the apparatus accomplishes a work of abstraction, extending a process
across multiple contexts. It functions in the same fashion every time,
following a schedule that runs from inscription to enlightenment at that
sixth hour when "even the stupidest man" deciphers the command ("IPC"
205). But at the same time that the machine leaves traces on bodies,
bodies leave traces on the machine. Numerous details evoke what is
missing--from the cane chairs that surround the apparatus to the felt
stump, rank with the saliva of dying men.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Presumably neither the soldier nor the condemned man understood French,"
Kafka writes. "It was therefore all the more striking that the condemned
man nevertheless made an effort to follow the officer's explanations"
("IPC" 194). On the levels of citizenship, language, and textuality,
"In the Penal Colony" presents the alien character of

<B></B>

power as a source of fascination and force. But the narrative
simultaneously reveals how this might be translated as a source of
vulnerability. It is this aspect of Kafka's story that I wish to bring
to bear on a particular postcolonial setting. First, however, I want to
create a context for my analysis by reflecting on one influential effort
to use Kafka's corpus to shed light on ideology and the Law.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

A Singular Apparatus
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka exaggerates nothing. So asserts Slavoj Zizek midway
through "How did Marx Invent the Symptom," an essay that explores the
implications for the analysis of ideology of a peculiar convergence of
psychoanalysis and Marxist thought. Starting with the Lacanian observation
that Marx invented the symptom, Zizek explores the ways in
which ideology works on the level of practice as an "unconscious illusion"
that structures "our real, effective relationship to reality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  What Kafka shows us is not a "fantasy image of social reality,"
  but, on the contrary, the "<I>mise en scene</I> of the fantasy
  which is at work in the midst of social reality itself" ("HDM"
  36).  Zizek continues, "we all know very well that the
  bureaucracy is not all-powerful, but our 'effective' conduct in the
  presence of bureaucratic machinery is already regulated by a belief
  in its almightiness" (ibid.). However we may comment on our actions,
  in the rituals of everyday life we act as if certain beliefs about
  value and authority were true.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Zizek uses Kafka's writings to illustrate Pascal's dictum
 on the "automatism" of belief: "Custom is the whole of equity for the
 sole reason that it is accepted" ("HDM" 37). According to his account,
 the circular assertion reveals the "constitutively senseless character of
 the Law" (ibid.). We obey the Law not because it is good or beneficial,
 but simply because it is the Law; rather than its virtues leading to
 obedience, obedience brings its virtues to light. The incomprehensible,
 traumatic character of the Law is what sustains its authority. But
 Zizek does not simply make Kafka into an illustrator
 of Pascal's theory of belief; he also marshals him as a critic of
 Althusser. According to this reading, Althusser failed to integrate
 his portrait of the materiality of ideology with his account of the
 interpellation of subjects. In the "little theoretical theater" used
 to showcase the workings of "ideological state apparatuses," Althusser
 failed to pay heed, as it were, to what happens in the split second
 between when the policeman yells and the subject turns around.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Althusser speaks only of the process of ideological interpellation,
through which the symbolic machine of ideology is "internalized"
into the ideological experience of Meaning and Truth: but we learn
from Pascal that this "internalization," by structural necessity,
never fully succeeds, that there is always a residue, a leftover,
a stain of traumatic irrationality and senselessness sticking to it,
and that <I>this leftover, far from hindering the full submission of
the subject to the ideological command, is the very condition of it.</I>
["HDM" 43-4; emphasis in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka develops a "kind of criticism of Althusser <I>avant la lettre</I>
in letting us see that which is constitutive of the gap between the
'machine' and its 'internalization'" ("HDM" 44). 

<B></B>

Kafka's novels begin with a hailing of sorts, in which the
protagonist is called by a "mysterious bureaucratic entity." The result of
the summons is not subjectivation; try as they might, Kafka's characters
can find nothing in the Other with which to identify, for the meaning of
the call remains obscure. Kafka thus offers a vision of a constitutive
moment in the working of ideology. In everyday life, the experience of
the apparatus as alien paradoxically leads to an identification with
it. A form of transference results, with the "supposition of a Truth,
of a Meaning behind the stupid, traumatic, inconsistent fact of the Law"
("HOM" 38). Ideology allows us to escape the traumatic dimension of
the Law by offering us social reality as an alternative. We come to see
ourselves in its terms in order to domesticate the shock with which the
ideological Other confronts us.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Zizek does not mention "In the Penal Colony" in his
discussions of Kafka. Still, it is possible to read the story through
the lens that he provides. Elsewhere he shows how two sections of <I>The
Trial</I> can be read as transformations of one another. In the first,
the priest's parable of the doorkeeper who stands "before the law,"
the Law is inaccessible; the subject only glimpses its radiance as
he is dying. In the second, which describes the protagonist's arrival
for his first interrogation by the Court, the Law is all too present
"in the guise of various obscene, nauseous phenomena."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  In fact, Zizek contends, the two perspectives implicate
  one another: "in so far as the law is not grounded in truth, it
  is impregnated with enjoyment" ("OOP" 151). "In the Penal Colony"
  stages two similar perspectives. The officer's explanation of the
  apparatus, like the priest's parable, describes a carefully calibrated
  passage toward the deathly moment when the Law is briefly revealed. In
  Zizek's model, the Law is senseless here because it remains
  incomplete; its truth, like the Old Commandant's, is missing. But the
  Law is equally senseless where it is inconsistent; it appears as a
  "bricolage," "smeared with an obscene vitality" ("OOP" 149). For
  the condemned man and soldier, the apparatus is a site of unseemly
  pleasure. While the officer is petitioning the traveler to advocate
  for his procedure, the soldier and the condemned man are devouring rice
  porridge. After the officer takes the formerly condemned man's place,
  the condemned man puts on filthy, torn clothing and entertains the
  soldier by cavorting around. The two men proceed to t over the
  ladies' handkerchiefs, chase the gears from the apparatus, and amuse
  themselves with the detritus from the machine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sympathizing with the officer--in whose place he claims he "would
have acted no differently"--the traveler is "annoyed" by the sight of
the recently released condemned man happily mimicking the officer's
explanation of the apparatus ("IPC" 224). In his aversion, one finds not
only a typical colonial disdain for native imitation, but one also sees
evidence of how the traveler's intervention fails.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Recall the elements that the officer had unsuccessfully tried to
  eliminate from his predecessor's judicial system: the lies of the
  accused, the sweets from the ladies, fingerprints on the drawings,
  vomit in the works. In his intervention, the traveler himself
  tries to eliminate similar contingencies on behalf of "humanity" as
  an ideal. It is as if the plot were designed to teach the traveler
  Pascal's dictum. He wishes to make the legal system more rational;
  and yet his influences simply reproduces its pleasures and restages
  its mysteries, without providing

<B></B>

the enlightenment that both he and the officer desired. The inscription
on the Old Commandant's tomb seems to capture a sense of this enduring
dilemma. The Old Commandant <I>will</I> always be resurrected: in the
form of the constitutive senselessness of the Law. From this perspective,
the traveler's harried departure follows the logic Zizek
outlines: he flees the traumatic <I>mise en sc&egrave;ne,</I> like
someone waking from a dream.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This reading of "In the Penal Colony" is compelling. Yet it fails to take
fully into account certain possibilities opened by Zizek's
observations on the alien character of the Law. If one carefully
follows  Zizek's argument that the Law's efficacy does not
rest on the communication of a singular truth, it becomes possible to
imagine a setting in which more than one form of transference could
result from the trauma of an encounter with the apparatus of the Penal
Colony. To get a sense of the instability of this situation, it is worth
reconsidering the traveler's reactions to those characters who "presumably
do not speak French." A crucial dimension of the story consists in the
traveler's effort to interpret the condemned man's own interpretation
of the situation. Assumptions about what the condemned man does not know
motivate his decision to intervene. Yet his interpretations are fraught
with uncertainty. The narrative tells us only what the other characters
appear to say or think; the prose is scattered with the expressions,
"seems" and "as if." The faces of the other characters often refract
a peculiar knowledge, as when the condemned man's stare seems to
ask the traveler "whether he approved of the described procedure"
("IPC" 198). This uncertainty intensifies after the soldier and the
traveler exchange words at the end of the narrative. After reading
the inscription, the traveler rises to look at the faces of the men
who frequent the teahouse. They are described as "smiling as if they
had read the inscription with him, had found it ridiculous, and were
asking him to concur in their opinion" ("IPC" 228). But is this the only
possibility that the traveler "pretends not to notice" when he heads for
the port? Among those who frequent the teahouse are said to be the Old
Commandant's anonymous supporters; in the teahouse the soldier and the
condemned man have both found acquaintances; could there be something
more than obscenity--some inscrutable meaning--that the traveler feels
compelled to flee? We can read "In the Penal Colony" as an illustration
of  Zizek's observations. But are we looking for the Law
when we should be looking for laws? Kafka's story shows us how power's
very alterity can lead to its subversion; the apparatus may not be so
"singular" after all. I would now like to turn to an ethnographic
situation where the possibilities hinted at in the story come more
clearly into view.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The province of Irian Jaya has long occupied a problematic place in the
vast island nation-state of Indonesia. Comprising the western half of
the island of New Guinea, which was claimed by the Netherlands Indies
in 1848, the territory lay for many years just beyond the limits of
effective colonial rule. For complicated reasons, when the rest of the
Indies gained independence, the Netherlands retained western New Guinea
as a separate colony, ostensibly to prepare its primitive inhabitants
for self-rule. Justified 

<B></B>

by the racial and cultural differences that supposedly divided New Guinea's
 "Papuans" from the rest of the Indies' natives, this post-war colonial
 adventure ended in 1963, when first the United Nations, and then
 Indonesia took control of the territory. In 1969, with the military
 suppressing all dissent, one thousand carefully selected tribal leaders
 unsurprisingly chose integration into Indonesia over independence. So
 western New Guinea became the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, and
 the Papuans became the Irianese.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A Papuan nationalist movement waxed and waned under the so-called New
Order regime, whose leader, President Suharto, ruled Indonesia from 1965
to 1998 through a combination of patronage, terror, and manufactured
consent. To suppress the separatists, the military engaged in horrific
acts of violence. But by the early 1990s, the government was shifting
away from the "security" approach, with the launching of projects
designed to develop the "backward" Irianese. In the off-shore regency
of Biak-Numfor, where I did fieldwork, the new strategy seemed to be
working. State-sponsored schools educated the islands' inhabitants in the
national curriculum and language, in which rates of literacy had long been
high. Village and city dwellers dealt with and worked for the military and
civil service, and were fluent in official rhetorics of rule. Those with
access to television consumed the same state-sponsored fare as viewers a
thousand miles away. In the near future, Biak would become increasingly
accessible to outsiders, with the opening of a resort that would take
advantage of the islands' position on the flight path between Los Angeles
and Bali. Although the regency had been the site of resistance in earlier
times, the relatively well-educated, cosmopolitan population seemed ready,
even eager, to enter the ranks of Indonesian citizens. One sign of the
regime's confidence was the very fact of my research in a province where
anthropologists unaffiliated with the government or missions had been
unable to do fieldwork for nearly thirty years.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But there may have been more to the islanders' submission than met the
eye. Through a dynamic I have elsewhere called the fetishization of the
foreign, the very practices through which Biaks signaled their acceptance
of New Order identities prove legible from a different point of view.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  This dynamic resided on various levels, beginning with the vocabulary
  with which people discussed successful persons. Parents spoke of
  their efforts to turn their children into "foreigners"--a Biak word,
  <I>amber,</I> which covered a field of reference including non-Irianese
  Indonesians, Westerners, Biak civil servants and respected persons
  more generally. One became a foreigner by virtue of one's origins
  or experience in the Land of the Foreigners, an imagined space that
  included sites as disparate as the provincial bureaucracy, the local
  port and market, Jakarta, the Netherlands, and Japan. Local foreigners
  provided evidence of their privileged access to such spaces through
  practices ranging from the exchanges that accompanied marriage,
  to the speeches given by local historians, to the songs sung by
  expert composers. These genres of social action both presupposed and
  reproduced a representation of the Land of the Foreigners as the source
  of pleasurable surprises, inexpressible meanings, and inexhaustible
  goods. When families participated in wedding processions that treated
  the market as a source of foreign booty, when ministers gave 

<B></B>

sermons that treated the Bible as a source of unfathomable truths, the very
effort to capture foreignness served to recreate it in the fetishistic
fashion inherent in the fact that to name the alien is to domesticate
it as such. Applied in settings associated with the Indonesian state,
this logic enabled Biaks to participate in national rituals without
accepting the identities they would seem to promote.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For an example of this deflection of national identity, consider the
trip to Jakarta I took with fifteen Biak singers in 1993.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  As part of the effort to promote tourism in Irian Jaya, the government
  was working to domesticate the threatening differences that once
  justified western New Guinea's separation from Indonesia. The goal
  was to incorporate Irian Jaya into the collection of equivalent
  cultural units to which the national slogan, "Unity in Diversity,"
  referred. Through official programs designed to identify and salvage
  "appropriate" local traditions, Irian Jaya would develop its own
  provincial house, wedding costume, and welcome dance. It was in this
  spirit that the Biak singers, aging experts in a once popular song
  form called <I>wor,</I> received an invitation to participate in a
  national festival of oral traditions. Including visits to monuments
  and a theme park, "Beautiful Indonesia in Miniature," the trip took the
  form of a national pilgrimage. Not least of all, the festival gave the
  singers a chance to present Irian Jaya's share of "Unity in Diversity"
  in the newspapers and on television, as well as on stage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was ironic that <I>wor</I> was selected for the honor, given the
form's history. Suppressed by the missionaries who settled on Biak
in the early twentieth century, <I>wor</I> was performed during the
millennial uprisings that occurred on Biak during the colonial period,
and by the Papuan separatists who took shelter in Biak's forests during
the 1970s. While the authorities seemed oblivious to the political
associations of the genre, the singers I knew viewed it as a potent
and dangerous tool. Then there was the matter of its form. <I>Wor</I>
songs provided a paradigmatic example of how Biak performers registered
the foreignness of experiences that might otherwise have seemed banal. I
was told that every song originated with a surprise; something startling
happened to a composer and a song simply popped into his or her head. The
composer repeated the surprise in the riddling structure of the lyrics,
with the first half of the song missing words that the second half
filled in. The <I>wor</I> experts I knew were very well acquainted with
airplanes, American tourists, and visiting officials. Nevertheless, their
songs on these topics had the effect of presenting everyday encounters
as unprecedented: as experiences that came as a shock.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given these factors, <I>wor</I>'s appearance at the festival seemed
like a victory for the forces of national integration. It was as if the
festival suddenly revealed to Biaks an element of Indonesianness within
themselves. The troupe that traveled to Jakarta was selected on the
basis of recordings made by an American ethnomusicologist. People on
Biak made much of the fact that outsiders had suddenly recognized the
virtue of this neglected aspect of their traditional ways. The call to
participate provided the first step in the process of interpellation;
the singers experienced the shock of finding themselves exposed to the
Other. In the next step, the shock should have faded, putting the men and
women in the position of some Indonesians who felt right at home in their

<B></B>

New Order identities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Yet there is evidence that the singers deployed a different mode
  of domestication in response to this encounter: one that engaged
  a symbolic order in which national spaces appeared as dangerous and
  seductive sources of power and value. In other words, there is evidence
  that Jakarta remained a place to raid.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Take, for instance, the stories the singers and their families told in the
weeks leading up to our departure. From the perspective of bureaucrats in
Jakarta, Irian Jaya was a frightening, Stone Age place. But as the singers
and their families saw it, it was the rest of Indonesia that was filled
with danger; the Javanese would "walk up and stab you without uttering
a word." While this perspective might be expected from people who had
suffered at the hands of Javanese soldiers, what was less predictable
was the accompanying image of distant cities as a site for intimate
encounters. Our voyage featured surprising moments of tenderness as the
singers discovered Biaks living abroad, or as they made new acquaintances
who reminded them of loved ones back home. Jakarta may have been the
land of dangerous strangers, but it was also the home of long lost kin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What the singers posited by way of narratives they performed by way
of <I>wor.</I> As I was warned before we left, the expert singers
had trouble keeping their mind on the repertoire of songs they were
supposed to be singing. New songs kept coming to them. From compositions
expressing amazement at the ship we had boarded to a ditty on a perfume
seller's breasts, the singers' songs affirmed the strangeness of what
they experienced. The theme park, "Beautiful Indonesia in Miniature,"
was perhaps the clearest example of the kind of "machine" through which
the New Order produced docile national-cultural subjects. But as they
toured the Irian Jaya pavilion, the singers signaled in conventional
ways that they were not at home. It was the theme park's foreignness,
not its familiarity, that their actions registered when they responded
to the visit by singing <I>wor</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the face of it there was nothing terribly subversive in the singers'
activities. On stage they played their role as tokens of Indonesian
national culture quite adequately. Yet their practices also served in
the production of another social reality, at odds with the order that
arrayed Indonesia's citizens on a national-cultural grid. These two
orders intersected in the state apparatuses that produced Indonesian
national-cultural subjects. Instead of internalizing a perspective that
would have defined them in official terms, the singers, like the condemned
man and the soldier in Kafka's story, derived a peculiar pleasure from the
encounter. Domestication in this case consists in reproducing the shock of
interpellation, not in finding meaning behind the Law's meaningless force.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To grasp this dynamic one must attend to the interpenetration of
ideologies. The Biaks I knew tended to emphasize characteristics of words
and things that other actors downplay in order to convey the impression
of commensurate values, orderly routines, and transparent, transmissible
meanings. Their practices employed the potential for alienation inherent
in every social gesture--every instance of exchange--whether thought or
speech. This is not to say that these individuals somehow possessed a
more truthful understanding of their practices; simply that they faced
different contradictions

<B></B>

than those who claimed to express their innermost cultural selves. For
their performances to succeed at attracting and entertaining an audience
of Biak listeners, <I>wor</I> singers had to present their songs as
evidence of something other than their own intentions, and yet they
had to be able to take credit for composing them. They had to adhere
to expectations regarding authoritative action that required that the
seat of agency appear as displaced. At the same time, in their quest for
recognition from a local audience, they had to obscure a force that was
omnipresent in the regency, in the form of institutions and apparatuses
that encouraged them to see themselves through different eyes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is with this interpenetration in mind that we must consider the
revival of Biak tradition that followed the festival in Jakarta. Less
than a year after the event, <I>wor</I> was resurrected as an official
emblem of Biak ethnicity. Although I was appalled at the time by the
speed with which people adopted the standardized version of the song
form, it is worth exploring whether something more complicated was
going on. Biak's colonial era uprisings erupted at moments resembling
that which preceded the revival of the song form. The largest outbreak
occurred at the beginning of World War II, after the mission began
promoting <I>wor</I> singing in church. In the movement that followed,
participants sang and danced and waited for the utopia that would begin
with the arrival of the ancestor who created foreign power. The revival
of <I>wor</I> was not as dramatic as the World War II uprising, but
it did contain utopian elements. Officials and villagers predicted an
influx of foreign tourists and a flood of invitations for local troupes
to perform abroad. Taking up the millennial strain always present in
official rhetoric on the "development" of postcolonial nation-states
like Indonesia, this response projected the islanders' "subjectivation"
across an eschatological horizon. The foreign would be revealed as a
local creation; the nation-state would appear as omnipresent force,
but only at the millennial moment when Biaks would startle the world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the context of early 1990s Biak, one might wonder whether this subtle
form of subversion mattered. In the year 2000 its implications became
clear. With the resignation of President Suharto and the fall of the New
Order, the province has seen a resurgence of Papuan nationalism. While the
fetishization of the foreign cannot account for why this has occurred,
it sheds light on the speed with which many Biaks have shifted their
allegiances. Actions that seemed to indicate an internalization of the
New Order's "truth" may well have sheltered a very different relationship
to the regime.

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When is power foreign? The answer may be always, but not always in
precisely the same way. In New Order Biak, as in the penal colony, the
alien character of authority is stressed. Yet instead of constituting
the "unconscious illusion" that ensures the efficacy of ideology,
foreignness was the product and precondition of practices that took it
as an explicit attribute of power. This does not mean that there was no
fantasy structuring social reality in Biak; only that it did not take
a predictable form. To make sense of situations like the one I have
described, we must attend to particular variants of broader

dilemmas as they reproduce themselves across different contexts of
social action. The gap between the machine and its internalization may be
essential to the process of subject formation. The same apparatus can,
however, act as an interface between social orders that both diverge
and overlap.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By juxtaposing my anthropological analysis with my reading of "In the
Penal Colony," I suggest that the alterity of power opens a space for its
subversion. The inscrutable faces and illegible texts of Kafka's story
do more than just register the Law's inconsistency; they also comprise
an intersection between multiple points of view. Much like the Biaks,
who use a local category, <I>amber,</I> to designate the foreign, Kafka's
narrative can only evoke the alien character of the Law by using res
that, of necessity, open onto wider worlds of meaning. The condemned
man and the soldier cannot partake in the apparatus as a senseless
site of enjoyment without gesturing towards other narratives, other
ways of making sense. My ethnographic writings focus on a situation in
which an encounter with state power similarly gives rise to something
other than the reproduction of official identities. I approach this
situation from a perspective that "In the Penal Colony" at once signals
and leaves obscure; my work on Biak is an exercise in imagining a social
order that undercuts the projects of officials and reformers alike. In
specifying this order's logic and contradictions, my findings offer
a caveat against too reductive a reading of Kafka's classic: neither
fiction nor ethnography can represent foreignness <I>as such</I>, though
both do sometimes capture its effects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For this reason, one must analyze the res one finds in
Kafka's fiction--and my fieldwork--with an eye to their historical
specificity. One must not underestimate the colonial character of both
settings. Like the condemned man and the soldier, Biaks were given no
choice but to join the political unit to which their islands now belong
at the time of western New Guinea's transfer to Indonesia. The New Order
may not have offered the form of punishment described in Kafka's story,
but its strategies for dealing with opponents included abduction, torture,
and summary execution--procedures no more transparent to those who came
up against the state's lethal force. The fact that Biaks experienced
encounters with the state as a source of pleasure as well as terror
poses a quandary for anyone who would assume the position of a Kafkan
traveler. Does it disqualify one's critique of an oppressive regime when
its victims' responses do not take the form one might expect? One of the
virtues of Kafka's story is that it refuses to offer a simple response
to the political questions it raises. In an age of U.N. peacekeepers
and international tribunals, it is worth considering the desires and
pleasures at work in the selective enforcement of universal standards
of justice and truth.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Admittedly, the world of Biak is far from that of Kafka. But I hope that
this effort to move between them has not been in vain. The ethnographer,
like the traveler--and any reader of Kafka's works--invariably finds
herself in that uncertain position that "In the Penal Colony" conjures
so well. This is a position in which the interpretive project founders
on moments that block understanding, on that traumatic left-over with
which analysis begins and ends. But describing this predicament is not
the same thing as overcoming it. At the very least, this reminds us of
the importance of remaining sensitive to differences that add to each
other without quite adding up.
