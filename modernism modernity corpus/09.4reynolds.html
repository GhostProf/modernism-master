<p>
On 1 August 1915, thousands of citizens and uniformed Irish Volunteer,
Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), and Irish Citizen Army (ICA)
members gathered at Dublin's Glasnevin Cemetary around the grave of
Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, a Fenian hero who had been accused by the
English of plotting rebellion in 1865, sentenced to penal servitude,
and then lived the remainder of his life in exile in the United
States. Patrick Pearse delivered a graveside oration claiming that the
dead body of O'Donovan Rossa revealed the truth of English oppression,
a speech that he hoped would unite public opinion in accordance with his
revolutionary ideals. Like other Irish nationalists, Pearse understood
that the emotional affect generated by the funeral of a hero might be
harnessed into political action, that collective mourning, focused
through the construction and veneration of a national martyr, might
construct a national community.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 According to Pearse, the spectacle of O'Donovan Rossa's funeral not only
 exposed the ways in which the English persecuted the Irish, but also
 galvanized the Irish public against their colonizers: "The Defenders of
 this Realm have worked well in secret and in the open. They think that
 they have pacified Ireland. They think that they have purchased half
 of us and intimidated the other half . . . but the fools, the fools,
 the fools!&#8212;they have left us our Fenian dead."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
If Pearse spoke for O'Donovan Rossa and defined the role of the "Fenian
dead" for the Irish public, it was Terence MacSwiney, the poet-playwright
and Lord Mayor of Cork, who created and then disseminated the fiction of
how O'Donovan Rossa represented the ideal Irish hero worthy of this role.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 In 1915,

<b></b>

MacSwiney wrote a memorial pamphlet commemorating O'Donovan Rossa. In it,
he makes no mention of O'Donovan Rossa's condemnation of the Catholic
Church, and there is no acknowledgment of the rumors that before his
death O'Donovan Rossa had reconciled with the British and condemned the
Germans. Instead, MacSwiney's Rossa is a forthright champion of Irish
nationalism, a hero whose demeanor reveals internal virtue. MacSwiney
recounts, "I, myself, saw Rossa in his old age going to his Easter
Duty in the Cathedral at Cork; and the picture I have in mind of him. . . makes for me a perfect picture of the consistent life."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Likewise, MacSwiney's Rossa speaks forthrightly, a characteristic
 supported by the real-life O'Donovan Rossa, who famously defended
 himself against treason at his English trial simply by asserting,
 "I believe in God, but I defy the Devil" ("R," 14). MacSwiney
 champions this defense by insisting, "If we all have as pure a faith
 as Rossa's and act up to it with as fine a constancy, Ireland shall
 have no need to despair" (ibid.). The abstract values of "faith" and
 "constancy" become material and visible when MacSwiney locates them
 in the body of a specific individual. Those who celebrated O'Donovan
 Rossa's death could read his words as "literal truth" because of his
 well-established constancy, the torture he endured at the hands of
 the English, and his final assertion that certain clear terms must
 remain in place&#8212;love God, hate the Devil; love the Irish nation,
 hate English tyranny. When MacSwiney insisted that "we all" can share
 in O'Donovan Rossa's faith and "act up to it," he presented Irish
 citizens with a means of salvation for the nation. The public body
 of the dead hero, as described by MacSwiney, provided the Irish "we"
 with a model of reliable moral behavior.

<p>
In his five-act drama <i>The Revolutionist</i> , written one year
before O'Donovan Rossa's funeral, MacSwiney set forth a similar message:
the Irish public could be consolidated and inspired by the funeral of a
hero who had displayed his authenticity to a public. The play's central
character, Hugh O'Neill, is a revolutionary hero who offers the Irish
public his straightforward brand of nationalism in an attempt to rescue
them from the secret political societies that pervade Ireland following
the institution of Home Rule.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Hugh refuses to align himself with his revolutionary colleagues who
 long for secret societies because he believes Irish nationalists
 must keep "the t straight and consistent" (<i>RAP,</i> 11). He
 fears that secrecy will divide the Irish public and encourage them
 to t among themselves, rather than to work together against
 the English. According to MacSwiney's characterization of Hugh, the
 Irish hero must maintain a consistent private self, which he can then
 display in order to keep the terms of the battle between the Irish
 and the English visible. Throughout the play Hugh searches for a way
 to reconcile the increasingly fragmented Irish publics and expose the
 "truth" (a term MacSwiney never clarifies) to them; in doing so, he
 realizes the fantasy of death may be the best means by which to unite
 the Irish. He insists that Robert Emmet, the executed Irish hero of
 the 1798 rebellion, had the proper notion of how to draw the public
 together. Referring to the speech Emmet delivered immediately before
 the British executed him for treason, Hugh claims that "Emmet's last
 words move us more than any possible oration he might have delivered
 as first president of the Irish Republic" (<i>RAP,</i> 92). In this
 speech, Emmet represented himself as "the sacrifice," a

<b></b>

hero who inspired the Irish through his martyrdom and his famous final
words: "Let no man write my epitaph . . . until other times and other
men can do justice to my character."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 While the political rhetoric of the living Emmet may have failed to
 inspire his audiences, Hugh insists that "Men standing by a premature
 grave are apt to reconsider their hasty judgments and indolent lives"
 (<i>RAP,</i> 92). Again, MacSwiney celebrates the notion that "other
 men" can perform Emmet's brand of Irish heroism, particularly if they
 are inspired by a communal celebration of heroic martyrdom&#8212;a truth
 made evident when Hugh dies in the service of the nation. Through his
 self-sacrifice, Hugh publicly verifies his true private nature as an
 embodiment of the heroic ideal to "be faithful forever" (<i>RAP,</i>
 136). By viewing his corpse at a national funeral, MacSwiney claims,
 the Irish public will see the merit of Hugh's "open" and "straight"
 nationalism and therefore will subscribe to his beliefs.

<p>
In both <i>The Revolutionist</i> and his pamphlet for O'Donovan Rossa,
MacSwiney forcefully argued that the public display of the heroic
martyred body was the most effective means by which to consolidate
a national citizenship. Through self-sacrifice, he insisted, <i>The
Revolutionist</i>'s fictional hero and the real-life O'Donovan Rossa
both used their bodies to announce their heroism, which was revealed
through the display of their congruent public and private integrity in
the face of English deception. But MacSwiney did more than simply renovate
literary and historical tropes of heroic death for a contemporary reading
public. During the Anglo-Irish War, he took on and lived out the heroic
role he had created for Hugh O'Neill and ascribed to O'Donovan Rossa. On
12 August 1920, soon after he had assumed his duties as Lord Mayor of
Cork and Commandant of the First Cork Brigade of the Irish Volunteers,
MacSwiney was arrested by British authorities during their raid of a
Volunteer meeting at the Cork City Hall.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 To protest his arrest he began a highly publicized hunger strike
 that culminated in his death in London's Brixton Prison seventy-four
 days later. By modeling and then reworking the long history of heroic
 martyrdom across cultures and religions, he offered his own emaciated
 body to the mass public as a means of displaying the moral superiority
 of the Irish to the English. The international press obsessively
 reported on each new development in his hunger strike, which MacSwiney
 and his compatriots represented as a purifying ritual that would shed
 the light of truth on British oppression and thus motivate the Irish
 and international publics to support the revolutionary cause.

<p>
I describe MacSwiney as a modernist martyr because the discourse
surrounding his death&#8212;a discourse he helped to create&#8212;reveals
that Irish nationalism, while deeply invested in traditional modes of
thought, was also committed to the deployment of modern practices to
free Ireland and to construct a cohesive national identity for its
people. Although MacSwiney celebrated traditional modes of heroism,
his use of his own body as a text through which to manipulate public
opinion marks him as a savvy manipulator of modern, mass cultural modes of
expression. Theorists of modernity and embodiment from Walter Benjamin
to Allen Feldman have noted that with the advent of mass culture,
images of the body become ubiquitous&#8212;as Michael Warner claims,
to be public in the West is to have an "iconicity," or a body whose
image can be displayed to the masses through print and visual media.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Through mass culture the

<b></b>

body becomes a text upon which messages can be inscribed, literally
or ratively, and then disseminated to the public. Like many of
the res involved in the Irish Literary Revival, MacSwiney merged
tradition and modernity when, by displaying his iconic body through
press statements made by family and acquaintances, he offered his model
of heroic subjectivity as a "style of publicity" available to a modern,
international public.

<p>
In many ways, MacSwiney's self-sacrifice appears to be an act lodged
firmly in the historic and mythic past. He based his style of Irish
heroism on traditional models of subjectivity, drawing from examples
provided both by religious and political martyrs and by the self-unified
Enlightenment public subject.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 By choosing self-sacrifice as his weapon, he invoked the long political,
 religious, and cultural legacy of the hunger strike to t the
 colonial government. His self-sacrifice resonated loudly with events
 in the Gaelic history and literature celebrated by the Irish Literary
 Revival, it evoked Catholic and Protestant iconography, and it pointed
 to a long legacy of Irish rebellions. Thus, his martyrdom powerfully
 engaged with a broad spectrum of tropes that defined Irish nationalist
 culture, which relied heavily on the past to represent the Irish as
 primitive and spiritual in contrast to the modern and corrupted English.

<p>
Yet the discourse surrounding MacSwiney's death reveals that his intended
audience differed radically from the audience sought by the historical
martyrs to whom he was likened. In particular, his choice of the hunger
strike foregrounded the differences between historical martyrdoms and
his own modernist version. Throughout history, individuals had fasted in
order to gain the attention of an autonomous higher authority, to demand
favor from a monarch or from God. In the mythos of ancient pre-Christian
Ireland, the code of law&#8212;the <i>Senchas M&aacute;r</i>&#8212;allowed
that an aggrieved person could starve on the doorstep of his oppressor
to redress an injustice, an edict Yeats dramatized in <i>The King's
Threshold</i> . The oppressor was required either to feed the
injured party or, if the starving individual died, to pay compensation to
the victim's family. In Christian tradition, Christ and various saints
had engaged in prolonged fasts for a variety of reasons, most often
to gain God's favor. With the advent of modernity, however, it becomes
clear that the intended audience of the fast had changed. MacSwiney's
hunger strike was represented as an appeal for intervention directed
neither toward God nor the English government, but toward two audiences
of his peers: the national public, who in modern times articulate their
opinions through the press and shape policy through the electorate,
and an international public, who helped to fund and publicize the Irish
quest for freedom. As his brother Peter MacSwiney insisted, "He is dying
to bring all these atrocities before the people of the world."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
MacSwiney was well aware that the suffering Irish body might be displayed
before Irish and English publics for political efficacy; it seems he
might also have been aware that the mass circulation of accounts of
his body's sufferings might influence the world's perception of the
Irish community. By scripting his own pure death and then successfully
following that script to the letter, he provided the mass public a more
disciplined and less contentious sacrificial model than was offered by
the rebels of the Easter Rising.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 His hunger strike also resonated with the infamous strikes staged a
 decade earlier by the English and Irish suffragists. By affiliating
 himself with these women,

<b></b>

who had aggressively publicized their sufferings under the English
constabulary, MacSwiney reinforced the perception of the English
government as oppressing innocent (and starving) victims ting for
their political rights. In addition, his hunger strike reminded the public
of the government's enforcement against the suffragists of the duplicitous
"Temporary Discharge of Ill Health Act" (the "Cat and Mouse Act"),
thus reinforcing the perception of the English government as tricksters
practicing the "English lie" ("R," 3). He thus engaged the sentiment of
those moved by these renowned injustices while simultaneously reinforcing
the image of the Irish as passive victims of English abuse. His intensely
visible body, whose masculinity was insisted upon at every turn, provided
a public text on which contesting messages could enrich rather than
deplete each other. He was both religious icon and secular, political
martyr; the passive, feminine victim, but also the active, masculine hero.

<p>
MacSwiney's hunger strike also offered a revision of the Irish
revolutionary Thomas Ashe's famous hunger strike, which had been staged
three years earlier. Ashe's death from force-feeding by the British
was regarded by the Irish as a murder, and his funeral presaged a new
wave of Irish militancy, which the English responded to by sending the
notoriously brutal Auxiliary forces and the Black and Tans to Ireland.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Both the English and the Irish press closely covered the atrocities
 these forces wrought; that coverage, in conjunction with the lingering
 resentment from the Easter Rising and the English desire for peace
 following World War I, meant that by the time of MacSwiney's death
 public opinion had undergone a tremendous change.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Worldwide public opinion was now largely in favor of a truce between
 the Irish and English. In many ways MacSwiney's death, which fell
 during the bloodiest phase of the Anglo-Irish War, can be regarded
 as a canny public relations move that responded to and helped create
 this shift in public opinion by offering a widely circulated image of
 Irish death as a "bloodless conquest."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Because his death was clean and direct, his body could be understood
 as a hieroglyph of passive resistance and nonviolent force against
 the English. His only weapons were his body and his sheer force of will.

<p>
Above all, his martyrdom must be understood as a promise to the mass
public that the Irish hero was a role any citizen could perform, a
promise that offered diverse individuals equal access to his valorous
persona. Many early-twentieth-century politicians and writers affiliated
with the Irish Literary Revival had argued that "Irishness" was predicated
on an authentic Celtic or Gaelic racial identity; they represented Irish
national identity to their audiences as an imperishable essence embedded
only in Irish citizens.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 In contrast, modernist thought, according to theorists like Stuart Hall,
 represents cultural identity as "free floating . . . disembedded from
 specific times, places, histories and traditions."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 MacSwiney's martyrdom worked to reconcile the essentialist ideology
 of identity offered by revivalism and this "free floating" ideology
 of identity offered by modernism. On the one hand, he propounded a
 revivalist sensibility that declared wholly congruent selfhood&#8212;a
 private, authentic nobility that registered publicly&#8212;to be
 a crucial aspect of authentic Irish heroism. Both O'Donovan Rossa
 and <i>The Revolutionist</i>'s Hugh are described by MacSwiney as
 self-unified men whose self-sacrifice further reveals their inherent
 heroism&#8212;thus their bodies can serve as

<b></b>

symbols of Irish national spirit. In an essay entitled "The Secret of
Strength," MacSwiney insisted upon this brand of congruent Irish heroism
when he asserted, "You cannot take up such a [heroic] character like
a garment to suit the occasion: it must be developed in private and
public by all those daily acts that declare a man's attitude, register
his convictions, and form his mind."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 However, he simultaneously insisted that heroic martyrdom achieved
 through self-sacrifice was a role any Irishman could perform through
 appropriate public and private action&#8212;a "fiction" of heroism
 that the "non-fictional" accounts of his own hunger strike and death
 then supported. This is the key to MacSwiney's modernist martyrdom:
 on the one hand, the martyr offers an essentialist mode of heroism
 located in the distant mythic time that preceded colonization, and
 through his self-unity publicly bears the marks of a heroic subjectivity
 specific to the religious and political tenets of Irish nationalism;
 on the other hand, this mode of heroism serves as a garment that can
 be worn as the Irish "style of publicity" by those who follow the
 terms so clearly described by MacSwiney's "brand."

<p>
Because it successfully negotiated the tensions between these opposing
models of identity, the Irish public could identify with MacSwiney's
particular mode of political agency. The real power of his martyrdom
rested on the notion that he had constructed and performed a traditional
heroic role available to modern citizens. Ireland's nationalist
press, literary res, and politicians colluded in representing
MacSwiney's sacrifice as a role available to all citizens. As <i>The
Irish Independent</i> reported following the death of the "Patriot of
Plain Men," MacSwiney "set the standard for the generality of men. For
though but one man in a generation&#8212;and it seems even as if he must
be foreordained for it&#8212;may aspire to be a Pearse, it is in all of
us to become a MacSwiney, dare we but put away as he did all self-seeking
and insincerity."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Similarly, in his autobiographical account of being a young
 "rank-and-filer" for the IRA, Sean O'Faolain recalled guarding
 MacSwiney's body during the Cork lying-in-state. For O'Faolain, the
 real power of MacSwiney's death was the way in which it asserted that
 "There was only one thing that every one of us knew he could do well,
 and must do well if called on to do it, the least active rank-and-filer,
 the humblest citizen. If arrested and condemned for any or no reason,
 each man knew that he could die&#8212;'For Ireland!'"
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 In America, the Irish politician Eamon De Valera praised MacSwiney's
 hunger strike in a speech worth note because, although De Valera was
 well-fed and traveling freely throughout the States, he could claim that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
my role here to-day is that of one speaking for a man who is dying,
but who, like the great champions of American liberty in their day, had
decent respect for the opinions of mankind, and who, when he is ready
to die for these principles, wants, at least, that the world should
understand the motive which is prompting him to give up his life. I am
speaking here to-night as I would like, if I were in MacSwiney's place
that someone would speak for me.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
MacSwiney is no longer a single embodied referent in the material world;
instead, his abstraction by the public and the press allows anyone to
ventriloquize him. Here, De Valera "speaks" for the imprisoned MacSwiney
so that "the world" might better understand

<b></b>

his motives. Just as MacSwiney scripted and then performed Hugh's
sacrifice for the nation, now De Valera, the Irish populace, and even
Americans could assume that same role and help to publicize MacSwiney's
political principles.

<p>
By consistently describing MacSwiney's struggle as a kind of theater,
press accounts of the hunger strike reinforced the notion that his heroism
was a dramatic role any citizen could perform before an audience; in doing
so, these accounts stressed that public display was a crucial component
of modern self-sacrifice. <i>The London Times</i> titled one account of
his death "A Political Tragedy," while the New York <i>Central News</i>
insisted of his sacrifice, "Call it folly, call it madness, there it
is just the same&#8212;a gesture of deep tragedy on a stage where all
mankind looks on."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<i>The Irish Independent</i> stated on the day of his death that "The
last act of the Brixton tragedy was enacted yesterday morning with the
death of the heroic prisoner."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Of course, the invocation of theatrical metaphors to describe
 MacSwiney's martyrdom threatens the essentialism upon which Irish
 national identity rests; with it arises the anxiety that somehow
 there will be inauthenticity and deception, the putting on of Irish
 identity as a costume. Thus, Irish press accounts of MacSwiney's
 heroism aggressively compensate for the ambiguity that accompanies his
 martyrdom by stressing his self-unity&#8212;the same strategy that
 MacSwiney deployed in his own constructions of Irish martyrdom. For
 instance, an account of MacSwiney's final days that appeared in <i>The
 Freeman's Journal,</i> remarkably entitled "The Drama of Brixton,"
 invokes theatrical metaphors to describe his sacrifice, but at the
 same time insists that his invisible spirit will triumph, that his
 real victory cannot be seen:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
strength and comfort come to him in ways not seen of the objective eye,
for as the body dies the spirit approaches to the world of the spirit,
drawing sustenance from its native element, till the doubts and fears and
hesitations born of the clay vanish in clouds of roseate hope. . . . [T]he
torture of the body is forgotten in a great, ineffable peace of the soul.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While such accounts may invoke theatrical metaphors, they simultaneously
stress the congruence between MacSwiney's private and public selves,
his honesty, and his love of Ireland. These truths were supported by
the wide circulation of his last words: "I want you to bear witness to
the fact that I die a soldier of the Irish Republic. God save Ireland."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
In his assessment of his recently martyred friend, Daniel Corkery
summarized what made MacSwiney so powerful to the Irish:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Any great movement towards a spiritual end, such as Ireland's present
push for freedom, obviously endows itself with creative power, as if
otherwise it could not progress; it takes the most diverse types and
unifies them, as all who to-day walk the streets of Ireland must openly
acknowledge. The explanation is that in such movements men like Terence
MacSwiney act out the desires of their souls, express those desires in
living matter, the dearest that is, flesh and blood. Such men we speak
of as master-spirits, master minds, outstanding res, commanding
personalities&#8212;all good words, if none be quite the right word.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Corkery insists on the capacity not just of MacSwiney himself, but also
of "men <i>like</i> Terence MacSwiney," to "<i>act</i> out the desires
of their soul." The power of those who take on the role that MacSwiney
imagined and performed is that they display in "flesh and blood" the
"spiritual end" that seeks freedom for Ireland. By using mass culture
and by letting mass culture use him, the modernist martyr displays his
integrated self to the international public; he "takes the most diverse
types and unifies them."

Burying MacSwiney, Birthing Ireland: 
<br />
Celebrating the Modernist Martyr's
Death
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Thus far, I've argued that the iconic body of the Irish martyr held a
tremendous amount of political potential because of its capacity both
to offer citizens a widely available and readily inhabitable heroic
subjectivity and to present the modern mass public with a traditional
model of citizenship that enfolds them in the "imagined community"
of Ireland. Often, however, theorists represent these modern publics as
bodiless phantasmagorias. Warner claims that "the mass subject cannot have
a body except the body it witnesses," and Benedict Anderson describes his
"imagined communities" as limited, sovereign political nationalities where
only "in the minds of each [citizen] lives the image of their communion."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 The funerals of MacSwiney&#8212;which gathered together hundreds of
 thousands of mourners in Ireland and across the globe&#8212;allow us to
 ask an important question about modern communities: What happens when
 these national abstractions and imaginings appear as audiences that
 come together in a shared space and time? To answer this question,
 I will examine the three major funeral processions that celebrated
 MacSwiney's sacrifice: the funeral procession and lying-in-state in
 London; the corpseless funeral procession in Dublin; and the funeral
 procession, lying-in-state, and burial in Cork.

<p>
From Thursday, 28 October to Sunday, 31 October 1920, the citizens of the
British Isles were described as a homogeneous public. In accounts of each
of these three funeral processions, observers seem astounded by the ways
in which diverse audiences came together peacefully in shared public grief
for this Irish hero. During the London mass held in St. George's Cathedral
in Southwark, for instance, the mourners were described as representing
"all classes and conditions of Irish people in London . . . [along with]
large numbers of persons who could lay no claim to Irish birth or descent,
but . . . who preferred death to the abandonment of a great principle."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 During MacSwiney's Dublin funeral celebration, the press described a
 public united in what <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> labeled "a day of
 universal sadness and mourning" in which, <i>The New York Times</i>
 asserted, "The inhabitants turned out virtually as a whole for the
 occasion."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 During MacSwiney's funeral and burial in his native Cork, a similarly
 diverse community formed. <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> described the
 mood: "It was as if the whole community was spellbound in a single
 calamity. The entire population of the city, swelled by crowds of
 mourners from beyond its limits, knelt at the graveside of Terence
 MacSwiney and there dedicated themselves to the hero-martyr and pledged
 his name and fame and sacrifice to immortality."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Just as MacSwiney had imagined in <i>The Revolutionist</i> and his
pamphlet on O'Donovan Rossa, the display of his corpse did in fact
consolidate the Irish. At the Cork lying-in-state, for instance, <i>The
Freeman's Journal</i> expressed astonishment at both the diversity of the
public and its unified response to the body. It extolled the immediate,
face-to-face encounter between mourner and corpse offered by traditional
funeral rituals when it remarked, "the wonder was where the people, men,
women, children, old and young, well-to-do and poor, clergy and laymen,
came from to make up the inexhaustible stream that ever circled and flowed
round the coffin holding the body of the chief magistrate, without fear,
without reproach."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Strikingly, another report illustrated how MacSwiney's body had become
 a mass article through the wide circulation of his image, when it
 celebrated the way in which his lying-in-state allowed the public to
 "gaze once more straight into the features, now, alas, sadly familiar
 to millions of Irish eyes."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 This account acknowledges that mass culture has disseminated MacSwiney's
 "features" to "millions of Irish eyes," suggesting that these "Irish
 eyes" might reside in bodies located outside of Ireland. While <i>The
 Freeman's Journal</i> described the oscillation between the real and
 imagined Irish community, another press account noted the slippage
 between the "real" MacSwiney and his fictions of heroism. As the
 commentator "Jacques" wrote in <i>The Irish Independent,</i> the
 intimate encounter between mourner and corpse in Cork resembled
 the model of heroic martyrdom MacSwiney celebrated in <i>The
 Revolutionist</i>: "In one fleeting moment I recalled the death of
 Hugh, the Hero of MacSwiney's historical drama 'The Revolutionist.' I
 remembered how, in the final tragedy of the troubled career of that
 indomitable re, the author pictured Hugh in his last sleep, just
 as now I saw Hugh's creator&#8212;fearless and calm with the look of
 the conqueror."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 MacSwiney's martyrdom provided an iconic body that served as a
 palimpsest for models of heroic protest, traditional and modern,
 real and fictional. It also provided a device to consolidate a public
 that was both traditional in its capacity to gather people together in
 shared time and space and modern in its capacity to shape an imagined,
 international community in the "millions."

<p>
Ironically, despite the thousands who gathered, MacSwiney's funerals
appeared to generate little immediate political action. By offering
the public myriad points of identification, the display of his corpse
allowed ostensibly antagonistic citizens in England and Ireland
access to a shared feeling of Irishness and of loss&#8212;even as
these citizens directly encountered other individuals who bore the
markers of radically different political, social, religious, and gender
categories. A close study of the funerals staged in London, Dublin, and
Cork reveals that the press, literature, religious ritual, and a variety
of institutions&#8212;traditional and modern&#8212;explicitly worked
to repress the revolutionary power that might have erupted during the
public celebrations of his martyrdom. The accounts of these funerals also
establish that the technologies of mass culture turned their attention
from MacSwiney's iconic body, which during his hunger strike had come
to represent revolutionary defiance, to the bodies of the Irish public
who mourned him. By doing so, mass culture served both the English and
the Irish causes. It defused the funeral of its potential to generate
immediate violent retribution against the English while also representing
the Irish as a cohesive and well-behaved national community.

<br />
The Mourning Masses on Stage
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Press accounts of the London funeral celebration staged on 28 October
suggested that a funeral by definition can not only draw together
the Irish public, but can also link that public with their sworn
enemy. Repeatedly, these accounts insisted that the Irish and English
publics, rather than being divided by national or political affiliations,
formed a community bound by shared sentiment. Such assessments appear to
support the claim that Joseph Roach makes in his reading of Afrocentric
funeral rites in Louisiana, in which he utopically announces, "Such a
performance event opens up, with its formal repetitions, a space for
play. Its genius resides in the very expandability of the procession:
marchers with very different connections to the deceased (or perhaps no
connections at all) join together on the occasion to make connections
with one another."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 By looking closely at MacSwiney's funeral in London, we can discover
 the particular conditions that allowed for the glossy and fantastical
 union between the English and the Irish publics. First, the funeral
 was consistently recounted in ways that acknowledge its power as a
 ritual embedded in a religious and folk tradition; this ritual not
 only requires a demonstration of respect for the deceased, but also
 generates authentic bonds of feeling among its celebrants. As <i>The
 Irish Times</i> noted, even English policemen were observed "wearing
 black gloves as a mark of respect to the dead, standing at attention
 when a coffin, covered with a flag they would call rebel passed by."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Second, the communal mourning in the London streets was attributed
 to the familiar and abiding sense of grief that characterized England
 during the interwar years. Having lost six million young men in World
 War I, the English were familiar with bereavement and well accustomed
 to granting death its public and ceremonial recognition.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 These two conditions encouraged the Irish and English publics to regard
 themselves as in accord against an unsympathetic English government. As
 <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> reported, "The English people, recognising
 how callous and shocking was the final torture inflicted upon the
 victim, felt ashamed of their government and angry with it that it
 should have persisted in the blood-sacrifice and should have thrown
 away the last hopes of a better feeling between two neighboring peoples
 to gratify the self-esteem of petty and posturing politicians."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps this unanimity is best explained by accounts that represented the
funeral as a spectacle in a world rendered ocularcentic by technologies
ranging from print and film to the telescope, a performance (not
unlike MacSwiney's heroic sacrifice) in which all individuals might
participate. Consistently, Irish journalists invoked visual metaphors
to describe the funeral as, for instance, "a remarkable spectacle [that]
created a profound impression in the English capital. Rich and poor and
different creeds and classes united in the tribute of respect."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 The funeral elicited an inherent sense of community among diverse
 peoples and created a "profound impression" largely because it was
 a striking visual scene. The distinctly modernist Wyndham Lewis, who
 was residing in London at the time, described MacSwiney's funeral in
 terms similarly focused on spectacle:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
During the martyrdom of the Lord Mayor of Cork I had several opportunities
of seeing considerable numbers of irish [sic] people demonstrating
among the London crowds. I was never able to distinguish which were
Irish and which were English, however. They looked to me exactly the
same. With the best will in the world to discriminate the orderly groups
of demonstrators from the orderly groups of spectators, and to satisfy
the romantic proprieties on such an occasion, my eyes refused to effect
the necessary separation, that the principle of 'celtism' demanded,
into chalk and cheese. I should have supposed that they were a lot of
romantic english-people pretending to be irish people, and demonstrating
with the assistance of a few priests and pipers, if it had not been that
they all looked extremely depressed, and english-people when they are
giving romance the rein are always very elated.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Lewis describes the mourners as a single community because these
individuals "all looked extremely depressed" so that in a crowd, they
"looked . . . exactly the same." He removes himself from the affect of
this scene, allowing himself&#8212;if not the London crowds&#8212;the
relief of "necessary separation" from mourning. While fascinating for
many reasons, this narrative signals a peculiarity that recurs in other
accounts of the London funeral celebration. Lewis attributes his inability
to distinguish between the English and the Irish in part to the fact
that the mourners "were a lot of romantic english-people pretending
to be irish people." I have argued that this "pretending" is one of
the pleasures afforded by the ambiguity that characterizes MacSwiney's
martyrdom. Here, we see the ways in which the public sought to identify
with this heroic subjectivity without having to endure its particular
suffering. The English and Irish mourners pretended to be not the heroic
martyr himself, but rather a romanticized version of the antimodern Irish
folk. In Lewis's account, this "pretending"&#8212;the way in which both
English and Irish people perform an idealized version of Irishness, along
with a supporting cast of priests and pipers to enhance the authenticity
of the scene&#8212;seems a fairly harmless moment in which the public can
imagine itself taking on the identity of romantic Ireland, dead and gone.

<p>
The coverage of the funeral by <i>The London Times</i> exposes how
these theatrical terms can be used, not simply to encourage unity
among a heterogeneous public but also to defuse the threat to the crown
represented by these crowds. Faced with MacSwiney's revolutionary body,
the English depicted the bodies of the Irish public according to distorted
cultural stereotypes. In one account, the <i>Times</i> described the
crowd attending the procession thus:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In one respect, however, both men and women were wonderfully alike. Both
presented a great variety of Irish types. The Irish peasant was there,
with broad face and uptilted nose; the lantern-jawed, mystical Irishman;
the swarthy, dark-eyed Irishman, own brother to the Spaniard. These and
others could be recognized from their prototypes in Irish story, drama,
and art. Even the Irishman who is said to exist only in the Englishman's
imagination was to be discovered without much search.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Obviously, the particular physical "types" described here limit the
availability of the abstracted heroic Irish identity. Instead, these
descriptions reassert that the Irish community,

<b></b>

while homogeneous, is assembled from the demeaning comic types found
in the English popular theater. Just as in MacSwiney's fictions of
the heroic Irishman, Irish identity can be constructed and then filled
by real individuals. However, according to this account the English,
not the Irish, determine the fictions and realities that define the
Irish public. In doing so, they emphasize the physical characteristics
of these types, disparaging rather than celebrating the bodies found
among the Irish public.

<p>
Press accounts of the London funeral procession revealed the logic
that allows for harmony among this cosmopolitan mourning public. It
could occur because Irish and English observers were able to rewrite the
procession as wholly unthreatening. This was done by theatricalizing the
crowds, but also by describing only those bodies that lacked political
power. Irish press accounts focused not on the virile young Irishmen
who marched in this procession, but instead on "the immense amount of
women who participated in its ranks" and the "extreme youth of the men
taking part in the proceedings, apart from the priests."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Not surprisingly, <i>The London Times</i>'s description of the funeral
 most egregiously represented the mourners as distinctly apolitical,
 stressing the crowd's "aloofness from all political feeling."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
This account also feminizes the mourning public, further distancing the
marchers from the heroic man they grieve:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Now and then came a woman of good physique who held her head high, as
with defiance. But near her might be a poor old grey-haired creature in
shawl and bonnet, obviously and sadly battered by the stress of life,
and hardly able to go on putting one foot before the other. A band of
girls whose smiles said that politics had not banished other interests
from their heads, would restore the balance a little. [ibid.]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, the female mourners clearly embody and display the weak nature
and easily distracted attention of the Irish.

<p>
The same account reveals that the English represented this political
spectacle as nonthreatening by focusing on the bodies of the Irish
public rather than on the martyred body of MacSwiney. In an interesting
twist, the English press described the marchers' bodies in parts,
remarking that "The mouths that smiled ever so faintly were, however,
rare. Most were hard set, and not a few were writhen" (ibid.). This is
a battle of expression, where a "hard set" or "writhen" face becomes
a weapon&#8212;but not a powerful or threatening one&#8212;in the war
between the English and the Irish. This same account did eventually
turn its attention to the male mourners in the procession, reporting
that the Irish men wore their hats in a similar fashion and therefore
"might have been called uniformed" (ibid.). Thus, while acknowledging the
effort to subvert the English ban on Republican uniforms, this report
simultaneously stresses the nonthreatening nature of the "uniform,"
which consists of "soft" hats worn "over the eyes." Consistently,
the mourners are described as weak and struggling, a description that
reflects the accounts of MacSwiney's body during his final days. In their
identification with this martyr and his withered corpse, the Irish public
represented their struggle as one that culminated in a national public
"sadly battered by the stress of life" and ultimately without a voice
or the energy to do battle&#8212;much like MacSwiney himself.

Dublin: 
<br />
The Corpseless Funeral and the Irish Spirit
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In the Dublin funeral procession held the next day, 29 October, the
struggle to define the iconic body of MacSwiney and the bodies of
those who mourned him continued. From London, MacSwiney's remains and
the mourning party were to travel together to Holyhead, Wales, then
on to Dublin, where Sinn F&eacute;in had planned an extensive funeral
celebration. As the corpse and the family arrived in Holyhead, however,
a surprise decree from the English government announced that MacSwiney's
corpse was to be shipped not to Dublin but directly to Cobh, a port
downriver from Cork. According to a letter hand-delivered to MacSwiney's
family at the docks, English authorities feared that "the landing and
funeral of the Lord Mayor in Dublin may lead to a demonstration in a
political nature."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The Irish mourners tried to resist this change of plan, with MacSwiney's
 sisters crying in defiance, "You have murdered our brother and you
 are not going to arrest his body."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 But English railway officials and policemen roughly pushed the mourners
 aside; the body was then seized by Black and Tans, placed by harbor
 crane on the English steamer Rathmore, and transported directly to
 Cork accompanied by a cadre of English soldiers.

<p>
The battle over the corpse in Holyhead, which was photographed and
reported in detail by the international press, suggests that at this
moment MacSwiney's body provided the public with a super-charged political
sign. The Irish and English struggled to define the social and political
messages that MacSwiney's corpse would exhibit to the mass public. For
the Irish, it displayed evidence that the English government was so
excessively brutal and corrupt that, in the words of <i>The Freeman's
Journal,</i> "Poor Terence MacSwiney was indeed being harassed, even in
the casket enclosing all that was left of him."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 Meanwhile, the English government, by wrapping the coffin in sackcloth
 and surrounding it with Black and Tans, hoped to label this hunger
 striker a criminal and thus prevent his corpse from becoming an
 illustration of Irish heroism. In an effort to wrest back the power
 to define the meaning of MacSwiney's body, Sinn F&eacute;in proceeded
 as planned with MacSwiney's Dublin funeral on Friday, 29 October,
 the day the corpse was shipped to Cork. The corpseless funeral in
 Dublin revealed the ways in which, following their loss in the battle
 over the body at Holyhead, these Irish mourners reasserted their moral
 superiority over the English and thereby created an ideal Irish public
 whose representations could be circulated across the globe.

<p>
While the accounts of the London funeral relied on theatrical stereotypes
to defuse the power of the Irish mourners, the Dublin accounts employed
a different stereotype of Irishness, that of the spirit&#8212;an ideal
consistently deployed by authors and politicians during the early years
of the Irish Literary Revival. As the contemporary critic Terence Brown
points out, spiritualism was important to the revivalists because it
provided "an image of a universal principle in the Irish world . . . the
manifestation of an objective, communal reality."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 In part, the revivalists imagined this poetic and religious abstraction
 might help to unite diverse Irish individuals into a homogeneous
 national public. For instance, following MacSwiney's death, De Valera
 asserted before yet another American audience the ease with which the
 Irish public could inhabit

<b></b>

MacSwiney's heroic role. He insisted that the Irish could identify with
the iconic body of MacSwiney because all Irish share the same essential
spirit. As he claimed, "Terence MacSwiney did not die to put spirit in
his own people. He knew that they had spirit; that they were waiting
to make sacrifices as he did. . . . There are thousands ready to follow
him that the conscience of the world may be aroused."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
The nation of the spirit offered a salient rallying point because the
pure Irish spirit was consistently represented as the antidote to the
rational, mechanized, urban, and contaminated modern world, a world that
was often coded as English. By invoking this spirit as the ideal, Irish
nationalists could reimagine every loss as a triumph that would supersede
any material victory in life. MacSwiney himself invoked this logic in his
pamphlet on O'Donovan Rossa when he imagined that Rossa had joined other
Irish heroes who had fallen in battle. He called on readers to "think of. . . the noble spirits of the earlier years&#8212;the martyrs of many
a persecution, and the heroes of many a field&#8212;we can imagine them
gathering together to await the issue of the last t. Why, then,
pray either to stand or fall, when either way we are happy?" ("R,"
16). This seems in many ways to be a fatalistic way of imagining the
nation&#8212;Ireland may achieve independence, but real triumph can be
found only in the spiritual afterworld. MacSwiney propounded this belief
throughout <i>Battle-Cries</i> , his collection of poetry. In
poem after poem he insisted that each defeat at the hands of the English
actually signaled ultimate victory for the Irish. As he wrote in his paean
"To the Dead at Eastertide ":


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
'Twas God broke the plan, letting the spirit have sway.
<br />
Ah, how the spirit rose on its wings, and its flight
<br />
Gleamed in the dark, and challenged, and put to affright
<br />
The power material, holding our land in its chains,
<br />
Till the voice of the many, who trembled, that power disdains.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While the Easter Rising revolutionaries may appear to have failed in their
endeavor to free Ireland, according to MacSwiney they succeeded because
their legacy inspired "the many" to revile the English. The real payoff
of sacrifice was not a military or political victory, but the inspiration
offered to the public when the spirit was released from the body.

<p>
In Irish accounts of MacSwiney's death, the spirit was repeatedly invoked
to represent his starvation as a victory that transcended the ability
of the English to capture and imprison him, to determine the route his
corpse must take, and to control the mourners. England might win a battle
of bodies and guns, they might have the material resources to seize
an Irish martyr's corpse and transport it as they wish, but the Irish
could retaliate by insisting on their spiritual superiority and their
belief in MacSwiney's tenet of "no compromise." De Valera assessed the
impact of MacSwiney's hunger strike by claiming, "It is the only field
of battle where we are England's match. It is the spiritual field, and
England's brute force may manacle MacSwiney's body, and they may torture
it, but MacSwiney's spirit will triumph in the ultimate victory of the

<b></b>

cause for which he is dying."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 After death, the body is mere detritus and, without the body to shackle
 it, the spirit can t more effectively for freedom&#8212;an important
 message to convey as the English sailed with MacSwiney's body across
 the Irish Sea. Following MacSwiney's death, one Irish nationalist
 paper included this quotation from a Spanish paper:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
England cannot even say that she has at least one enemy less. For this
enemy&#8212;apart from the spiritual life beyond the grave&#8212;lives
henceforth in the memory of his fellow-citizens, with a life more active,
more effectual, and far more to be feared than his personal life which
has closed. The corpse of MacSwiney, mummified by his seventy-four days'
fast, will be for England an adversary more terrible than an army of
robust and well-armed athletes.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In this passage, the sacrificial removal of MacSwiney's body from
the community gives spiritual life to the community&#8212;a life that
exists in the bodies of those who wish to t England. And the mass
publicity of this body, of the corpse that signifies the spirit's new
life, transforms MacSwiney into a more powerful force than even the live
bodies of "robust and well-armed athletes."

<p>
This invocation of the spirit suggests that the corpse holds revolutionary
potential primarily because it is an indexical sign that MacSwiney's
triumphant spirit has been released. However, when this spiritual ideal
was deployed in Dublin, it appears only to have repressed the energy
generated when the Irish mourners and the English authorities came
into conflict while in Wales. The revolutionary energy that this press
report suggests his "fellow-citizens" might distill from MacSwiney's
spirit&#8212;the spirit that would endow them with "a life more active,
more effectual, and far more to be feared"&#8212;in fact revealed itself
through the widespread harmony among the mourners. Rather than rise
in protest, the public appears here to have embraced the revivalist
sense of the spirit as a tool that can unite and pacify an otherwise
fractured community. The Irish nationalist paper <i>Young Ireland</i>
insisted upon the primacy of this kind of spirit in the following passage:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The empty hearse passing through the City of Dublin was even more symbolic
of the heroic spirit of Ireland's dead than anything else could have
been. In the empty hearse, Dublin and Ireland visualised the spirit
of Irish nationality&#8212;his mortal remains were in charge of the
English forces, but his spirit was in the hearts of the Irish people,
beyond the touch of English defaming hands.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
With the loss of the body, it seems, the Irish gained a nonviolent means
of demonstrating their animus toward the English.

<p>
Only the English press stressed the absence of MacSwiney's body in the
Dublin procession, insisting that "All the arrangements which had been
made for the reception of the body were carried out punctiliously. Only
the central re was absent."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 For the English, the absence of MacSwiney's body mattered in a way
 it appears not to have mattered to the Irish. There are subtle signs,
 however, that his body did in fact

<b></b>

hold an important role in the Irish imagination since, as seen at
Holyhead, it was the very device that displayed the injustice of the
English government. While the shell of MacSwiney's soul was not the
only component that could gather a live public, its trace in the form
of a hearse or the sight of the mourning family could bring Dubliners
into the streets. <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> described the crowds as
though they had assumed the body of their suffering hero:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Dublin remained one quivering nerve of pain and horrified, though
courageous, emotion. The great spirit of the people seemed somehow to
have gone out to keep vigil over the ashes of their dead patriot and
to have left behind it a want, an absence, a strangeness. One felt a
tension brooding over all too deep a source and too long suffering to
display in outward grief.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Like MacSwiney himself, in this account the Dublin mourning public suffers
pain and horror, its spirit flying out of its body. While in London the
Irish public was described as embodying a theatrical mourning public
on display, in Dublin their suffering was described by the Irish press
as too intense "to display in outward grief." The Irish papers engaged
the rhetoric of spectacle not to create a homogeneous mourning public,
but to indicate the difference between the Irish and the English. The
<i>Irish Independent</i> recounted how MacSwiney's family was treated
during the Dublin funeral mass by noting, "An English crowd would have
gawked. It would have watched its every movement. Afterwards it would
have a tale to tell. Grief even is not sacred from the profane eyes of
such people. But Ireland knows sorrow and respects suffering."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 In this account, the English merely watch suffering and sorrow in order
 (like Wyndham Lewis) to produce a tale, while the Irish are able to
 use spectacle as a means to engage authentic emotion.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Cork: 
<br />
Discipline and Mourning
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In <i>The Revolutionist,</i> MacSwiney constructed a narrative in which
Hugh's funeral unites the Irish public and exposes to them the truth
that Home Rule conceals ongoing English oppression. In the early acts,
however, Hugh does not immediately recognize that the nation requires
the public sacrifice of a hero to inspire its citizens. Instead, he is
convinced that oratory will persuade the public to support his political
tenets. Armed with this belief, he embarks on a public speaking tour of
Ireland, apparently presuming that his audiences will be inspired by his
political doctrine if he regresses to a theatrical model of political
display. In doing so, he relies on the feudal mode of publicity that
J&uuml;rgen Habermas describes as "the public sphere as publicity of
representation," a space wherein the virtue and authority of the state
were displayed through the body of the nobleman.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 But this older model of representation fails to unite the modern Irish
 public, and Hugh's travels result only in ravaging his body, the medium
 by which his political stance is conveyed to the audience. Hugh's
 friend Fan insists he stop this campaign of political display because
 his efforts effect little change

<b></b>

among his audiences. Upon his entrance, she insists, Hugh's audiences
"immediately become restive and after a while the usual trouble begins"
(<i>RAP,</i> 117). Hugh disregards Fan's advice and travels to Cork
so that he might inspire another politically enervated audience. When
he returns home, he immediately dies of exhaustion. He unintentionally
sacrifices his life to a fantasy public that he believes can be swayed
by theatrical display, when in fact it becomes clear that the audience
will immediately disperse and not use the energy generated by his public
oration in any meaningful way.

<p>
MacSwiney then posits that the death of the Irish hero and the display of
his body can reveal the "truth" of nationalism to the public and therefore
can unite them in struggle toward a common goal. Hugh's bereaved wife Nora
insists that when all look upon the "beautiful" visage of his corpse, they
will see "the look of the conqueror" and subsequently understand "'Tis we
who are troubled and frightened. There is no fear on his face. . . . Those
who doubted must come and see him dead" (<i>RAP,</i> 135). The fears that,
according to Hugh, were provoked be secret revolutionary societies and
the Catholic church are not visible on the face of the single dead hero;
consequently, it is possible for his corpse to inspire the public to
behave with a similar type of bravery. As Nora insists, "We must leave
him uncovered that everyone may look on his face, that men may wish to
be like him in death&#8212;" (<i>RAP,</i> 135). The mourning public
relates to Hugh's dead body in a very different way from the public
that attended his speaking engagements. Rather than creating "the usual
trouble" as they did at Hugh's speeches, the audience can now identify
with his ideals and retain "his memory always beautiful" (<i>RAP,</i>
136). In MacSwiney's fantasy of death, the display of a corpse unites
Irish citizens in a more permanent and powerful way than the display of
a living political body. The permanent "wish to be like him in death"
engendered in the mourners presents a stark contrast to the transient
friction the audiences experienced when they were exposed to his mortal,
speaking body.

<p>
The funeral celebrations and burial of MacSwiney in his native Cork,
which were held on Sunday, 31 October, initially seem to support the
notion that funereal display can magically unite an otherwise fragmented
public. Accounts of the Cork funeral described the same peaceful formation
of community that attended the rituals in London and Dublin&#8212;with
one notable exception. The <i>London Times</i> mentioned the arrival of
MacSwiney's body in Cork late Saturday afternoon, suggesting that the
corpse would somehow engender rebellious activity among the mourners by
noting that an "air of apprehension throughout the city over what may
happen on the day of the funeral of Lord Mayor MacSwiney seemed to have
superseded the restrained attitude with which the populace received word
of the incident at Holyhead."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
 The mood in Cork was tense, and when low tides meant that the delivery
 of the body might be delayed, according to <i>The Irish Times,</i>
 "People then began to speculate unkindly about the movements of
 the ship."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 But any tension was thwarted at this particular moment by the church's
 capacity to channel political energy into the passive ritual of
 prayer. As this report continued, "Speculation was checked, however,
 with the call to general prayer, when the churches were unable to hold
 their congregation anxious to join in

<b></b>

supplication for the repose of the soul of their first citizen. On all
sides business was suspended, and the city assumed a solemn Sabbath air"
(ibid.).

<p>
This moment at the dock, wherein public conflict is suppressed in the
interest of prayer, is important because it foregrounds the way in
which the church actively participated in the disciplining of the Irish
public. Anger over the treatment of MacSwiney's corpse was channeled into
prayer for the dead hero's soul. This type of ecclesiastical discipline
was evident throughout the events surrounding MacSwiney's death. At the
moment of his death, MacSwiney's chaplain, Father Dominic, immediately
sent a telegram to the Deputy Lord Mayor of Cork. He advised the city's
citizens to "maintain the same calm, dignified, and noble bearing which
they exhibited on the assassination of [the previous Lord Mayor] Thomas
MacCurtain."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Notably, Father Dominic alluded to the murder of MacCurtain and his
 peaceful funeral, rather than to the death of Ashe, which as noted
 earlier, prered great violence in Ireland. The <i>Irish Times</i>
 reprinted this letter from Father Cohalan, a Roman Catholic Bishop of
 Cork, which similarly stated that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
for the moment it might appear that the Lord Mayor had died in
defeat. This might be conceded if there were questions merely of
the individual, but it is not true where the issue of the nation is
concerned. We are the weaker nation in combat. Sometimes we tire of
the conflict. Anyhow, the questions of Land, of Local Government, of
Housing, of Education, for a time engage our attention. But periodically
the memory of the martyr's death will remind a young generation of the
freedom of Ireland.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This letter asserts once more that MacSwiney and the nation are conflated
in the national imagination, but in a way that gives emphasis to the
frailty of Ireland and resonates with the London newspapers' earlier
insistence on the weakness of the women and children who composed
the Irish public. Memory here is merely to "remind" the public of
freedom&#8212;not to inspire that public to t for freedom.

<p>
MacSwiney's fantasy, that the mere display of a heroic corpse would
somehow organically unite a fragmented public, revealed itself in Cork
to be only part of the story. In fact, not only the Catholic church
but a variety of institutions consciously worked to manage the behavior
of the public during the funeral celebrations. The most evident source
of discipline was, of course, that of the English military forces. As
discussed, the English government decreed where the body could and could
not go. The government also forced the family to accept the body on their
terms when "A threat by Government officials to take charge of the body. . . and bury it in the barracks yard here led to the family finally
accepting delivery of the remains after they had lain for several hours
on the Customs House dock here tonight."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 In addition, <i>The London Times</i> reported that the English
 government sought to control the bodies of those who mourned MacSwiney,
 noting that "the competent military authority will take steps to ensure
 that no military display is made, such as the wearing of uniforms
 or Republican armlets or badges, or movement in form of bodies, or
 drilling of any kind. . . . [The funeral] procession must be kept
 down to a reasonable length&#8212;not longer, it is suggested, than
 a quarter of a mile."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Even more powerfully than the colonial military

<b></b>

forces, the tradition of the bourgeois funeral served as a disciplinary
device that superseded religious, racial, and political affiliations and
that called for the formation of a homogeneous mourning community. In
one of the many press accounts of respectful mourning, <i>The Freeman's
Journal</i> reported that when MacSwiney's remains passed through the
city, the Black and Tans and the police saluted in deference to the dead.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>

<p>
It is not particularly surprising to discover that the Catholic church,
the English government, and middle-class mores worked to discipline
the mourners. More remarkable is the fact that Irish nationalists also
helped to pacify the Irish public. Irish nationalists faced legitimate
anxieties regarding the impact of bad behavior on the celebration of
MacSwiney's death, anxieties that were realized at Holyhead. In London
immediately following his brother's death, for instance, Peter MacSwiney
had expressed fears that Republican demonstrations might prevent the
English from allowing the corpse to return to Ireland at all, only to find
those fears almost realized. But even when the Republicans had the body
in tow, they continued to insist that the Irish mourning public behave
in an orderly and peaceful fashion. Members of both the Irish Parliament
and Sinn F&eacute;in asked the public to refrain from violence, while
voicing a concern that "the younger element" or the IRB might disregard
these orders.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 The nationalist press also colluded in enforcing this kind of
 discipline. <i>The Cork Examiner</i> insisted that "Good-citizenship
 connotes amenability to discipline and order, and respect for the dead
 for whom the community mourns ordains that the last solemn rites shall
 be conducted in a manner befitting the man and the country for which
 he died."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>

<p>
The international press represented the mourning public as homogeneous in
their respect, but there were in fact disruptions: against English orders,
a number of Volunteers mourned in uniform; after the London funeral,
MacSwiney's brown habit was replaced with his Republican uniform; a Gaelic
inscription on the coffin bore a staunchly political message, claiming
MacSwiney was "Murdered by the Foreigner"; and across Ireland, civilians
were arrested for displays of Republicanism. But these ruptures were
small and few. Consistently, descriptions of quiet and orderly behavior
attended the vast crowds who watched the processions staged in London,
Dublin, and Cork. While the Irish and English had overtly restrained
these crowds, clearly MacSwiney's iconic body, a text inscribed with
self-discipline and a refusal to compromise with the English, had become a
point of identification for the Irish public. The Irish saw themselves in
his martyred corpse and exploited that identification to their political
benefit. The mass circulation of the images and accounts of the orderly
Irish public at the funerals challenged one of the powerful binaries
by which the English justified their occupation of Ireland. No longer
could the English government claim it was obligated to enforce order in
a land troubled by the deviant behavior of the "Wild Irish."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
 On the contrary, the Irish public was represented as civilized and
 restrained in the face of England's barbarity.

<p>
Throughout MacSwiney's funeral celebration the Irish were portrayed not
as an unruly mob, but as a well-behaved community. In his widely read
1901 essay, "The Battle of Two Civilizations," the Irish journalist
D. P. Moran cited one of the great

<b></b>

anxieties of the Englishman as a concern over manners. He claimed, "it is
difficult to get the Englishman to admit that there is any civilization
in the world other than British. . . . When he talks of morality, he
thinks only of the British variety, of liberty, progress, good taste, and
so on; he shows somewhat more intelligence on the question of manners,
for here he allows himself to be haunted by the suspicion that his may
after all be only second rate."
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
 The funeral allowed the Irish to display their good behavior before an
 international public and therefore to exacerbate these anxieties. The
 funerals also allowed for a display of manners that spoke well of
 Ireland's capacity to govern itself. The good behavior of the crowds
 could be attributed not only to the innate self-control and respect of
 the civilized Irish people, but&#8212;perhaps more distressing to the
 English&#8212;this behavior could also be attributed to the discipline
 and order enforced by the Irish Volunteers. <i>The Irish Independent</i>
 claimed that "the vast crowds were kept back by cordons of Volunteers,
 who maintained splendid order throughout."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
It is crucial to note, however, that the English were accomplices in
creating MacSwiney's cohesive mourning public. They had cleverly used
the funeral to defuse the revolutionary energy generated by the events
that followed the Easter Rising. When the English government executed
the men involved and then prohibited any funeral celebrations for them,
the Irish public&#8212;who had initially been somewhat frustrated by the
dramatic and futile rebellion&#8212;transformed these poet-rebels into
martyrs and their futile resistance into heroic rebellion. The moment
MacSwiney died, a reporter for <i>The London Times</i> recalled that "the
Republican 'heroes' of 1916 have become already landmarks in Nationalist
Ireland's struggle for freedom"; thus, the correspondent announced,
"I understand that [in MacSwiney's case] the executive authority are
disposed to allow legitimate scope for the expression of public sympathy."
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
 By allowing the Irish public to mourn, the British correctly sensed
 that they could stifle further revolutionary sentiment and political
 insurrection. They may also have been responding to the dangers
 presented by the mass cultural dissemination of MacSwiney's modernist
 martyrdom since, as <i>The Cork Examiner</i> noted, "interference with
 the funeral arrangements would have done them no good with the English
 public, and would have outraged the opinion of every civilised country."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
The widespread celebration of MacSwiney's funerals may have offered the
English an even subtler, but equally pernicious, means of reinforcing
their power over the Irish. At his burial, the nationalist and elegiac
rhetorics surrounding his martyrdom asked the Irish public to identify
further with MacSwiney, to recognize that each of them might be called
to sacrifice for Mother Ireland. Like MacSwiney, with whose heroism
they had explicitly been asked to identify, each Irish citizen would
eventually become a corpse that, as the eulogy proclaimed, "reposes in
the Irish earth of his Motherland."
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
 For all of the changes that modernity had wrought, there remained one
 inescapable truth in the religious promise, "Ashes to ashes, dust to
 dust." Perhaps it was the pervasive display of this inescapable truth
 that most potently repressed significant revolutionary action among the
 Irish during the funeral. Rather than promising a radical break from
 the past, MacSwiney's iconic body, his mass-circulated heroic corpse,
 may have signaled that there can be little change in certain essential
 truths. If

<b></b>

the Irish had deeply internalized their subjection at the hands of
the English&#8212;a subjection enforced over centuries&#8212;then
perhaps MacSwiney's martyred body served to display once more that
the inevitable march of progress&#8212;be it biological, industrial,
or imperial&#8212;could not be stemmed.

<p>
What then was the final revolutionary outcome of the messages MacSwiney's
iconic body wore before the mass public? By internationally distributing
images and written accounts of his death and burial, mass culture
presented his sacrifice as evidence of Irish victimization at the hands
of the English. As MacSwiney had imagined in <i>The Revolutionist</i>
and in his panegyric for O'Donovan Rossa, the Irish heroic corpse
not only exposed English oppression, but also consolidated the Irish
public. Through their identification with MacSwiney's self-disciplined
body, citizens of Ireland, England, and even the United States came
together both as an "imagined community" and as a real audience of
mourners in shared time and space, even if only for a few days. His
martyrdom preceded the English execution of the young Irishman Kevin
Barry, the events of Bloody Sunday, the IRA's flying column attacks
on the Auxiliaries, and the burning of Cork by British forces. These
violent events, all of which occurred in the days and months following
MacSwiney's death, drove the English to the bargaining table, so that
by December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty mandated the creation of an
Irish Free State of twenty-six counties. In the midst of the violence
of the Anglo-Irish War, the accounts of his martyrdom offered the Irish
and international public an alternative mode of revolutionary action. By
presenting Irish bodies as registers of self-discipline in the face of
English oppression, a new form of heroism was established. MacSwiney's
modernist martyrdom meant that his self-inflicted death could be
interpreted not just as another in a transhistorical legacy of sacrifice
for a noble principle, but also as a public relations coup bringing the
Irish closer to independence.

This fantasy was in no way original to MacSwiney or the Irish
nationalists. In their analysis of death rituals, the anthropologists
Peter Metcalfe and Richard Huntington insist that any death unites a
community, but that historically the death of a royal person&#8212;or
here, the Irish nationalist hero&#8212;fuses a community even more
strongly because the funeral may be regarded as "part of a political
drama in which many people have a stake." See Peter Metcalfe and Richard
Huntington, <i>Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary
Ritual</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 134. If, as
Lauren Berlant argues, the living body of a celebrity urges individuals
to shed their own bodies (see note 8), then a royal funeral takes
this one step further because, according to Metcalfe and Huntington,
"a royal funeral, ef, or corpse becomes a highly condensed set of
symbols directly representing every one of the deaths of all the people
of the realm" .

Like many nationalists in early twentieth-century Ireland, MacSwiney's
political and literary careers were intertwined. He was one of the
founders of the Cork branch of the Irish Volunteers, and he was to have
been second in command of the Easter Rising in Cork and Kerry. When
Thomas MacCurtain was killed by British soldiers in March 1920,
MacSwiney took his place, both as Lord Mayor of Cork and as the head
of the Cork Brigade of the IRA. As a literary re, he helped form
both the Celtic Literary Society in Cork and the Cork Dramatic Society;
he authored <i>Battle-Cries</i> , a book of poems dedicated to
the "Dead at Eastertide"; and he published four plays. Furthermore,
MacSwiney's work in <i>Fianna Fail,</i> the revolutionary newspaper he
edited, reflected his commitment to Ireland's cultural and political
life. Biographies recounting his martyrdom and the political career
that preceded it reveal his striking investment in the body as a
means through which to display revolutionary political ideals before
a live public. See Moirin Chavasse, <i>Terence MacSwiney</i> (Dublin:
Clonmore and Reynolds, 1961); Francis Costello, <i>Enduring the Most:

Terence MacSwiney, <i>The Revolutionist: A Play in Five Acts</i> (Dublin:

though published in 1914, was first performed after MacSwiney's death,
in February 1921, at the Abbey Theater. Upon publication, it received a
lukewarm reception in the <i>Irish Citizen,</i> which claimed the play
would "keep the puzzled reader in a mood of dissatisfaction and needless
obscurity." See L. C., review of <i>The Revolutionist,Irish Citizen,</i>
29 August 1914, 115. Likewise, following MacSwiney's death, Yeats bluntly
labeled <i>The Revolutionist</i> "not a good play," but went on to insist
that the Abbey should stage it because "the last pages will greatly move
the audience who will see the Mayor in the play's hero." See Letter #34,

and the Emergence of the Irish Free State 1918-1939: Living in the
Explosion</i> (Troy, N.Y.: Whiston, 1981), 23. Krimm offers an excellent

Yeats's decision to rewrite the conclusion to <i>The King's Threshold</i>

MacSwiney was charged with a variety of crimes, including the possession

to decode British messages and documents (pledging allegiance to

Majesty." See Chavasse, <i>Terence MacSwiney,</i> 145. He was tried on

Oliver MacDonagh has argued that Irish political culture is defined by its
efforts to conflate the past and the present, by its allegiance to "the
contemporaneity of the past." See Oliver MacDonagh, <i>States of Mind: A
Study of the Anglo-Irish Conflict 1780-1980</i> (London: Allen and Unwin,
1983), 9. Similarly, Terry Eagleton argues that Irish political culture
blends "the archaic with the absolutely contemporary." See Terry Eagleton,
<i>Heathcliff and the Great Hunger: Studies in Irish Culture</i> (London:
Verso, 1995), 279. In his discussion of Irish modernization, Luke Gibbons
argues that "idealizations of rural existence, the longing for community
and primitive simplicity are the product of an urban sensibility" and thus
mask the real modernizing influences in nostalgia. See Luke Gibbons, "The
Myth of Modernization in Irish Culture," in <i>Transformations in Irish
Culture</i> (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1996), 85.

"Peter MacSwiney's Views," <i>The New York Times,</i> 26 October 1920,
7. During the early twentieth century fasting had become a tool for modern
mass political purposes and was a particularly salient one for MacSwiney
in light of the long shadow cast by the Irish Famine of the mid-nineteenth
century. According to Joseph Lee, this famine was the moment in which
the Irish recognized themselves not as powerless objects of God's will,
but as modern political subjects oppressed by the English who could exert
influence over the government through their vote. Evidence that the modern
public perceived hunger strikes as efficacious acts of resistance may
be found in the series of well-publicized strikes staged in England and
Ireland during the early twentieth century. This revisionist depiction
of the hunger strike&#8212;as an action directed toward the mass public
in order to elicit agency from them&#8212;was so powerful and pervasive
that the nationalist paper <i>The Watchword</i> announced, "From the
earliest times the hunger strike has been made use of for the purpose
of bringing public opinion or odium to bear on cases of injustice." See
"The Hunger Strike in History," <i>The Watchword,</i> 23 October 1920, 3.

Patrick Pearse and the other rebels of 1916 offered the public a

Davis). For helpful accounts of the Easter Rising, see <i>Revising the

In 1917, Sinn F&eacute;in strengthened the link between nascent political
consciousness and hunger by celebrating the death of Ashe, the president
of the IRB who was imprisoned for his involvement in the Easter Rising and
died at Mountjoy Prison. Ashe's funeral procession drew over 40,000 people
and successfully turned their attention from the failure of the Easter
Rising and Sinn F&eacute;in's lack of an articulate national policy
to English oppression. His funeral was imagined as a covert display
of native military presence, an opportunity for the IRB to demonstrate
that they were a military force to be reckoned with, a message conveyed
through the succinct eulogy that Michael Collins offered after a volley
of gunshot was fired at Ashe's graveside: "Nothing additional remains to
be said. That volley which we have just heard is the only speech which it
is proper to make over the grave of a dead Fenian." See Ulick O'Connor,

For a discussion of ways in which British stereotypes represented
the Irish as dirty, violent, and subhuman, see L. Perry Curtis, Jr.,
<i>Anglo-Saxons and Celts: A Study of Anti-Irish Prejudice in Victorian
England</i> (Bridgeport, Conn.: Conference on British Studies, 1968) and
<i>Apes and Angels: The Irishman in Victorian Caricature</i> (Washington,
D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1971). In his recent collection of
essays, R. F. Foster argues that Curtis fails to account in his study
of <i>Punch</i> for the equally acerbic and demeaning caricatures of the
English in this publication. He also notes that Curtis limits his focus
to simple racial prejudice, failing to acknowledge the role of class and
religion in English prejudice. See R. F. Foster, "Paddy and Mr. Punch,"
in <i>Paddy and Mr. Punch: Connections in Irish and English History</i>
(London: Allen Lane, 1993).
