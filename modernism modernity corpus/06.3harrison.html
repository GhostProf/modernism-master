<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This paper was written in response to two different and in their
ways equally vivid experiences. The first was an encounter with
a monotype by Degas in the Art Institute of Chicago, a work from
the mid-1880s, measuring approximately eight by sixteen inches (<A
HREF="6.3harrison_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 To make a monotype the artist normally draws in printing ink directly
 onto an unabsorbent surface, such as an unmarked engraving plate. The
 plate is then put through a press, transferring a single clear image
 directly onto paper. Since the image is unfixed, this process effectively
 erases it, though sometimes a sufficient residue of ink is left on
 the plate to permit a second and fainter impression to be made. Where
 Degas recovered a second impression in this manner he would frequently
 work over it in pastel, developing the motif substantially as he did
 so, sometimes adding paper to extend its margins and thus to enlarge
 the original pictorial space. He was to do just that with a second
 proof of the monotype from Chicago, adding strips of paper at top and
 bottom to make a nearly square overall image, in the process locating
 the represented re at a more conventional distance from the picture
 plane, and thus transforming the effect of the composition. It is with
 the first and unaltered impression that I am principally concerned,
 however, since its very containment and darkness are crucial to its
 individuality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this case Degas worked in negative, covering the entire plate with a
film of ink, then scraping, wiping and dabbing at the oily surface to
produce an image. This image takes a moment to discern, as if we had
to adjust our eyes to the darkness before it will come clear. What it
shows is the nude body of a woman, reclining on a couch with her right
elbow and forearm

<B></B>

 close up to the picture plane at its lower edge, her raised left
knee breaking the picture's upper edge, and her legs extending into the
deepest part of the pictorial space at the top right-hand corner. At
the lower left corner a circular area has been wiped clean of ink to
signify a table lamp. This forms the picture's only light source. The
re's head is particularly difficult to make out. This difficulty may
be partly accounted for by the dazzling effect of the lamp, but there
is also a suggestion that the head is as it were too close--too nearly
identified with the picture plane itself--to bring properly into focus. It
was this suggestion in particular that brought me up short when I first
saw the monotype a few years ago. When combined with the literal and
rative darkness of the image, the effect was of something analogous
to a failure or deprivation of the sense of sight. My first motive for
this paper, then, was to explore and to explain that sense of failure
or deprivation. I shall take a long way round in the attempt to do so,
but I shall come back to the monotype in the end.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is one last point I should make in introducing the image in
question. As if to underline the uniqueness of the impression, the artist
marked it not simply with a signature but with a dedication, "Degas
&agrave; Burty." Philippe Burty was a writer sympathetic to the work of
the Impressionists and a major collector of modern prints, Degas' very
much included. This was not a work conceived for exhibition, then. It was
a gift to a male friend, as were three other related monotypes showing
nude female res, each of which is named for a different recipient.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In the climate of art history and art criticism that now surrounds the
 work of Degas there is an uncomfortable implication to be drawn from
 these dedications. It is best that

<B></B>

we face it squarely. It concerns the meaning of the work's privacy. The
almost inescapable suggestion is that images such as this circulated
outside any public view precisely because their combination of artistry
with indecency destined them for the secluded enjoyment of men of a
certain sophistication. In other words, the intended function of the
monotype was to supply an expensive taste for erotica. I mean in the
end to argue against this view, but its apparent plausibility should
nevertheless be faced when we consider how the effects of the image are
in fact produced. If left unacknowledged, assumptions about the functions
of works of art are all the more likely to inflect inquiries into their
composition. Possessed of an unexamined certainty that a given work was
designed to serve the interests of fantasy, we are less likely to look
for the kinds of effect that might produce a realistic self-consciousness
in the spectator.

This takes me to the second experience by which this paper
was prompted--in this case the effect produced by a body of
interpretation. Over the course of the past twenty years or so, Degas'
pictures of women have been subject to extensive re-examination in the
light of a wider feminist re-reading of modern art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 It is through the initiative of feminist art historians in particular
 that the viewer's psychoanalysable response to the individual work of art
 has come to be accorded a deciding role in inquiries into its meaning
 and even into its value. And since it is a fundamental assumption
 of psychoanalysis that we must respond differently according to the
 differences in our gendering, it follows that considerations of the
 relativities of gender must play a large part in such inquiries. So
 long as differences of gender were <I>not</I> held to be of any
 account in the interpretation of art, it could be assumed that it was
 differences of opportunity or disposition alone that stood in the way
 of an equal enjoyment of images such as Degas' pictures of bathers
 (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 2</A>). To analyze an artistic
 composition was traditionally to show how these differences might be
 overcome in principle; that is to say, it was to elucidate a structure
 of effects that were conceived of as aesthetic, and thus as potentially
 open to experience by all. In the memorable words of Clive Bell, "To
 appreciate fully a work of art we require nothing but sensibility. To
 those that can hear Art speaks for itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 As so often, however, it transpired that the illusion of universal
 agreement was simply a consequence of women's voices being silenced or
 going unheard. Nowadays, where the analysis of effects is at issue, a
 vigilant feminism encourages us to ask "effects upon whom?" And once
 that question has been asked we can no longer take it for granted that
 the pleasures art has to offer <I>are</I> potentially pleasures for
 all. Claims for objectivity in aesthetic judgement have of course been
 troubled since the nineteenth century by reflections on the effects of
 cultural difference and by the findings of class analysis. But it is
 one thing to acknowledge the significance of cultural familiarity or
 the relative advantages of education, class, money and leisure when it
 comes to the appreciation of art; it is quite another to say of a work
 of art that its responding spectator is <I>necessarily</I> male.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This point has been well rehearsed in readings of late-nineteenth century
French painting. It takes an emphatic form in the recent literature on
Degas' bathers, occasioned

<B></B>

 as this has been by a series of major exhibitions in which these works
 have featured.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Heather Dawkins, for instance, describes one of her several papers on
 the artist as "a study that negotiates my displeasure in studying an
 artistically heterosexual drive."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In the view of a second writer this drive is both prurient and
 punitive. What Anthea Callen regards as the artist's "tortured twisting
 and dislocation of female anatomy," suggests to her "not only the pain
 of shame but its punishment." The shame is the shame occasioned by
 men's prostitution of women, the punishment women's reward for serving
 as the objects of men's desire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Griselda Pollock proceeds further along similar lines. "As a woman
 viewer," she writes, "I am forced to take up the proffered sadistic
 masculine position and symbolically enact the violence of Degas'
 representations, or identify masochistically with the bizarrely posed
 and cruelly drawn bodies"--bodies "which in social exchange he debased
 and abused, and which in aesthetic practice he punished and tortured."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was the experience of these voices--voices speaking in virtual
unison--that provided the second prompting for this paper. The coincidence
of these two promptings is clearly problematic. At the least I am bound
to reflect on the nature of my fascination with the monotype and on the
pleasure I generally take in Degas' pictures of women. Analyses such
as those I have cited are not to be swept aside either by reference to
the artist's incorrigible genius, or because they threaten men's sense
of themselves as civilized beings. On the other hand if we are honest
about our responses to works of art we must acknowledge that we can't
just haul them into line with some supposedly virtuous position. We
can't just like what we may think we  ought to

<B></B>

like. In this particular case, I find myself drawn involuntarily into a
game of high stakes. It is not simply that I have been happy to accept
Degas as a significant re within the modern period. He appears to me
now as one of the principal artists of the entire Western tradition. Of
course, this would be no problem if the man who painted could be kept
safely apart from the man who lived an examinable social and moral
life--if we could say that ethics has nothing to do with aesthetics;
that Degas' pictures could be the over-determined products of an abusive
and sado-masochistic obsession and nevertheless be admirable. There are
indeed those who believe that the matter of an artist's social conduct is
irrelevant to his artistic practice--and by extension, presumably, that
the personal predilections of the spectator play no part in a properly
"aesthetic" response. Unfortunately I am not one of these. I have to allow
that if the writers I have quoted are justified in their reading of Degas'
work, then my liking for it must be an incidence of bad taste--evidence,
in other words, of deficiency or failure of the critical imagination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So I propose to look again at Degas in the light of the feminist
case. I should make clear that my primary aim in doing so is not to
claim a position in academic debates on his work, but rather to respond
to an implied critique of those such as myself who esteem his images
as pleasurable, and to re-examine the grounds of that esteem and that
pleasure. There are two connected charges which it seems that the work
in question must be made to answer. The first is that it is implicated
in processes of prostitution; the second that its effect is to leave
its viewers caught between a sadistic voyeurism and a masochistic empathy.

I should first establish some undisputed common ground. The broadly
feminist account of late-nineteenth century French painting is clearly
justified in two important respects. The first is in drawing attention
to the tendency for pictorial compositions to be oriented towards
an imagined male spectator. The second is in alerting us to the fact
that the question of how women look and are looked at is a significant
concern in rative art during the period. In fact I think that these
two points can be brought together to construct a stronger claim than is
generally made by feminist art history itself. It is this: that during
the first period of development of modernism in painting--say in the
fifty years between 1860 and 1910--the matter of how women look was an
issue so central to work done by male artists that it was decisive for
the character of that development.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 So far as art is concerned, there seems little point in talking about
 development at all unless what we are addressing are changes in the
 criteria of aesthetic success and failure. The implication of the
 claim, then, is that the question of how women look was a matter of
 such moment to the early modern practice of painting as somehow to bear
 upon the aesthetic merit of any relevant work. Of course this is not a
 hypothesis that anyone should be asked to accept without considerable
 elaboration. In particular we need to know just <I>how</I> it is that
 the success of the artist's work is affected and decided. And before
 we can properly address that question we need a clearer sense of just
 what it is that is supposed to be doing the affecting; what it is, in
 other words, that is included in the question of "how women look." These
 issues are best understood by reference to examples. Suppose, for

<B></B>

instance, that one was asked to decide on aesthetic grounds between
Degas' <I>Combing the Hair  </I>in the National Gallery, London,
and Luke Fildes' near-contemporary <I>An Al-fresco Toilette</I> in the
Lady Lever Art Gallery (. <A HREF="6.3harrison_3.html">3</A> and <A HREF="6.3harrison_4.html">4</A>). What kinds of difference in
observation, imagination and composition might one have to take into
account in explaining one's judgement?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is clearly an ambiguity at the heart of this matter. It revolves
around the passive and active senses of looking. To ask how women look
is to consider both what women look like and what it is like for women
to look. This ambiguity is so firmly built into our language that it is
hard to dislodge. In our ordinary social experience there is a typical
moment upon which the resulting confusion bears down to vivid effect. It
is the moment at which the one looked at looks back; when someone is
<I>caught looking</I>. The resulting exchange is one with potentially
infinite social and psychological content. One's gender, one's sexuality,
one's age, one's class, one's race, one's relative financial power--all
these are at play and at stake. And what typically happens is that the
relations in question are resolved in an instant, leaving one or other
party relatively empowered, one or other looking away.

Moments with infinite content are meat and drink to the art of
painting. In the 1860s and 1870s the exchange of glances becomes of all
painting's potential themes the one most diagnostic of its modernity
(if not of its modernism). Both the ambiguity and the vividness of such
exchanges are clearly caught in a number of memorable and canonical
images. The women in Manet's <I>Olympia</I> (<A HREF="6.3harrison_5.html"> 5</A>) and Renoir's
<I>La Loge</I> (<A HREF="6.3harrison_6.html"> 6</A>) are carefully described as the bearers of a
specific self-consciousness. And in each case we are instructed by the
organization of the composition to furnish an appropriate cause. The look
of the women will only make sense, that is to say, when we see them as
appearing under the regard of an imagined male. And it will be a matter
critical to the effect of the painting in question whether or not this
regard is seen as returned, and how the relative powers are then seen
as distributed. Of course, it tells us nothing we don't already know
about social and sexual  relations in nineteenth-century France to
observe that the female party in any actual exchange was generally the
one obliged to look away, or that the woman who failed to do so was in
danger of being deemed immodest. But we should not assume that the art of
painting will conform straightforwardly to the kinds of generalization
that may be supported through social and historical research. The
production of modern aesthetic effects may depend on modes of critical
self-consciousness which are opaque to such researches precisely to the
extent that their causes are private, inescapable,

<B> [Begin Page 65]</B>

and thus realistic. In fact the ability to bring some social and
psychological complexity to the exchange of glances is a noticeable
measure of modernity in relevant paintings from the mid-1860s until at
least the end of the century.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It should be clear that this was not simply a matter of differences
in subject matter; of picturing one type of woman or one social
situation rather than another. The more significant differences were
compositional. That is to say they were differences in the means by which
the spectator's imaginative activity was stimulated and structured by the
painting. There is an important implication here. If it is true that a
preoccupation with how women look bears down in some general way on the
development of painting as a medium in the later nineteenth century, then
certain technical changes noticeable in paintings which are pictures of
women are of relevance to the evaluation of modern painting in general,
whether or not women are pictured.

These are difficult issues to grasp in the abstract. They may be best
considered through a relevant comparison. I am as certain as I can be
that Auguste de Molins' painting <I>The Coming Storm,</I> which appeared
on the London art market in the mid 1980s, is the work exhibited in Paris
in 1874 in the first independent exhibition of the group that was to be
known as the Impressionists (<A HREF="6.3harrison_7.html"> 7</A>). The title was listed in English
in the original catalogue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The artist was one of that cohort of relatively conservative independents
 that art history has for

<B></B>

the most part forgotten. The paradigm spectator to whom the painting
caters is someone practiced in the relatively unsophisticated business
of seeing the joke, which here concerns the relationship between
the weather conditions described in the background and the trio of
res isolated in the foreground, each of whom represents a type
easily enough exemplified in the 1870s both in literary fiction and on
the actual streets of Paris: the colorless ranks of the bourgeoisie at
the hour of promenade; the publicly respectable and privately lecherous
gentleman; the interloper in whom the identities of decadent artistocrat
and aspiring plutocrat are purposefully confused; and, crucially, the
enticing re of the well-dressed woman in whose image another confusion
is strategically maintained--those of the fashionable bourgeoise and
the glamorous prostitute. The respectable gentleman is about to lose
the game the picture plays out. It is coming on to rain and he has no
umbrella. The woman has only a parasol. The picture implies that she is
open to offers. The interloper has a waiting carriage with a hood, and
thus a decisive advantage, as he clearly knows. He is going to get the
woman, though he may not know what woman it is that he will actually
be getting. To the small delight of its prospective consumer, the
painting plays upon topical themes of sexual opportunity and of social
and economic competition, of prospective conquest versus on the one hand
and of jealousy and affront on the other. Pleasure, for this consumer,
lies in observing the human comedy from a position safely this side of
its surface.

SRC="button/6.3harrison_8b.gif"></A>
Also contributing to the same independent exhibition was the now
better known painter Auguste Renoir. The work called <I>Les Parapluies</I> was begun some years after that exhibition, and my guess is that it
was prompted in part by a memory of de Molins' work, conscious or not
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_8.html"> 8</A>). For what Renoir has done is to take something very close to the
same topical theme and to modernize it. As in the earlier painting, rain
is falling at the hour of promenade. The well-dressed working girl at the
left of the picture appears to be the object of speculative attention
from the gentleman behind her, who in this case is equipped with an
umbrella, as the girl is not. Where, then, is the second gentleman, whose
presence is required in order to bring an animating tension and urgency
to the pictorial drama? The answer, of course, is that his position must
be occupied by the imaginary spectator, who thus becomes what Richard
Wollheim has called the "spectator in the picture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 It is he who is seeing what the picture shows.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the sake of my argument, there are two particular points to note;
the first is that the presence of this spectator is cued or required
not only by the curious outward stare of the little girl at the right
of the painting, nor simply by the angle of vision to which the entire
composition submits, but more poignantly by the carefully described
self-consciousness of the woman in question, around which the effects
of the painting are thus made to revolve. The second point is that
these effects are of no real account unless they construct an answering
and thus implicated self-consciousness as it were on this side of the
picture plane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Renoir has sophisticated the mode of reference to the topical theme
 of sexual speculation by rendering the spectator both an imaginary
 occupant of the social world described, and an active imaginative
 agent in its conduct. He has managed this by taking the narrative
 components out of the fictional depth of the pictorial space, where
 de Molins has them safely embedded, and redefining them as features of
 the spectator's social and psychological world. To become a competent
 spectator of Renoir's painting, then, one begins by occupying this
 world in imagination as someone disposed and equipped in the precise
 terms that the work itself defines. This means that one occupies it as a
 man--a fl&acirc;neur perhaps--whatever may be one's actual gender. But
 if someone is to argue that the effect of this is to privilege the
 male spectator, I would ask them who will find it hardest to occupy
 the fl&acirc;neur's position: the well-read middle-class woman, or
 the iconoclastic working-class male? Note that Renoir offers no guide
 to the outcome of the exchange of glances, nor any judgement upon its
 ethical character. What he does is to define with consummate pictorial
 skill the specific character of that "moment with infinite content."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was fashionable a few years back to condemn Renoir as a kind of male
chauvinist. Much was done to draw attention to the implicit gendering
of the spectator and to the regressive attitudes to women discovered
in such pictures as this. We need to be careful, however. In art as in
literature it often turns out that the painting or the text has got there
before us, and that that which we think we have exposed in it was always
a part of the content which it had taken into itself and reflected back
in critical form, had we only been assiduous enough readers to notice. It
is one thing--

<B></B>

proper to all critical activity--to revise the bases upon which we make
our judgements and accordingly to review the objects of traditional
admiration. But we need to be sure that any naivety we think we have
discovered in the works in question was not actually our own. The
admonishing finger we point at the moral life of the artist may
otherwise miss the target of the work by a distance that must in the
end be embarrassing to ourselves. The moral character of the producer
may indeed determine the aesthetic character of the production, but it
will not necessarily do so in ways conforming to our own self-images as
moral beings. Renoir might well have fallen short of our contemporary
notions of correctness in sexual relations. But if his painting pictures
the exploitable female as a potential object of consumption, it also
allows us to experience in imagination what it is like both to look
<I>and to be looked at</I> like this. It is thus edifying irrespective
of the gender we actually inhabit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the two paintings here compared are indeed paintings that
include pictures of women, what the comparison crucially reveals is a
revision in the priorities according to which the surfaces of paintings
are conceptualized and developed. In other words, if the forms of
self-consciousness involved in the development of a modern art are
indeed largely learned and practiced in paintings that are pictures of
women, once the relevant changes are effected they become conditions
of modernism and of aesthetic adequacy in painting as a whole. Beyond
a certain point, in other words, it becomes impossible for a painting
if it is to be modern to evade the issue of who it is that the pictured
world is supposedly being seen by, and how it is that it is therefore
being seen. Indeed, I would suggest that by the 1870s the modernity of
a painting's composition could be recognized in the following terms:
that it was so ordered and distinguished as to pose the question, "Who
is supposed to be seeing what this picture shows?" and to do so as a
necessary part of its effect. Of

<B></B>

course, to say that this was a question <I>raised</I> by the typical
modern painting is not to say that it was a question to which all
spectators necessarily responded.

It's time to return to Degas. His painting <I>Au Caf&eacute;</I> (also
known as <I>L'Absinthe</I>) was painted in the late 1870s (<A HREF="6.3harrison_9.html"> 9</A>). Its
evident focus is upon a woman sitting alone at a caf&eacute; table--or
at least we take her to be alone, her isolation being suggested by
the palpable absence of any sense of contact with her neighbor at
the table. Viewed thus the picture can be seen as testifying to that
documentary interest that the patrician realist maintains in the lives
of those beneath him. As the supposed author of such a picture, Degas
stands as it were outside its world looking in. This was the Degas whom
many of his contemporaries likened to the misanthropic scientist, whose
disengagement from the human tragi-comedy ensures the dispassionateness
of his findings. Of course, it was with regard to his pastels of women
bathing that this combination of misanthropy with disengagement was
particularly observed. These are pictures of prostitutes, it was assumed,
since only a prostitute would allow herself to be shown in the process of
intimate ablution. Poverty and prostitution are degrading, so the argument
went. Furthermore, the woman whose business is the arousal of men is no
better than an animal. It follows that the ugliness and bestiality of the
women is a guarantee of the accuracy--the truth--of the artist's vision.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 To be outside looking in is also to be in the position of the voyeur; of
 the man, that is to say, who consumes the appearances of others from a
 distance that ensures his own safety. Thus the late-nineteenth-century
 reading of Degas the misanthropic realist prepares the ground for
 the late-twentieth-century reading of Degas the abusive and sadistic
 voyeur. The advocates of the latter are the natural heirs of the
 proponents of the former. In the first case, the ugliness of the women is
 attributed to the brutalizing effects of their existence and the animal
 nature of their trade; in the second, it is attributed to the sadistic
 operations performed by the artist upon their bodies. But in both cases
 it is the (mis)perceived ugliness of the women that produces the reading.

We may gain a better understanding of Degas' picture if we set beside it
another in the same vein--or in what Fernand Lungren, who painted it, no
doubt thought of as the same vein (<A HREF="6.3harrison_0.html"> 10</A>). The contrast serves to draw
attention to those formal and technical properties of Degas' work which
may go unremarked even as its ostensible subject is noted. Lungren's
picture has an emphatically conventional viewpoint and perspective, its
tables ranged neatly parallel to the picture plane. The effect is to
locate an imagined viewer at a socially and psychologically normative
distance from its represented subject--just where we might expect to
find the male this female's presence invites. What the comparison makes
clear is that the organization of Degas' picture actually presupposes
a viewpoint virtually within the picture plane, which its nearest
table intersects. The angle of vision is oblique, the perspective
unsettled. Where Lungren's picture is painted with a consistently sharp
focus, Degas learns a lesson from photography and employs change of focus
as a compositional device; sharp on the features of the woman, so blurred
on the objects near at hand that their identities are in doubt. And once
that difference of focus has registered in relation

<B></B>

to the viewpoint, the sense of a viewing position outside the represented
scene collapses totally. It transpires that the position of the imaginary
viewer is as inescapably located within the world depicted as is the woman
herself. In which case, what price the supposed distance between viewer
and viewed? We are now in a better position to appreciate the apparently
intrusive and ambiguous shapes with which the foreground of Degas'
picture is populated. They are indefinite because they are found at the
margins of the imagined spectator's consciousness, where newspapers and
matches would be for someone looking up and across the caf&eacute;. Their
function is both to define that consciousness and to locate it. Degas'
educated contemporaries placed themselves outside the world of the
picture because they could imagine themselves nowhere else. But that
is not where the picture places its own imagined spectator. This latter
spectator is the product of the painter's artifice. To the question, "Who
is seeing this?" the painting's actual spectator answers unthinkingly,
"I am." Yet it would actually be nearer to the truth of the painting to
say, "She is." In other words, the imagined viewer occupies a position
which is far closer to that of the pictured woman than it is to that
normally assumed by the fascinated or condescending bourgeois male.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we want to explore the implications of Degas' work, we could do worse
than to look to the younger artists who worked

<B></B>

under his shadow. During his so-called Blue period, the young Picasso in
particular produced a number of perceptive paraphrases of Degas' inquiries
into the nature of looking and representing (I think particularly of the
damaged <I>Portrait of a Man</I> from the winter of 1902-03, now in
the Mus&eacute;e Picasso in Paris). "Who is this and who am I?" he seems
to ask with regard to the res he paints, but also "What is it to be
an artist? Does my vocation keep me apart from these others, so that
I remain in my world, regarding the evidence of their poverty with an
interest which is academic, touristic, voyeuristic. Or are artists fellow
denizens of Bohemia? Could such images show how I too am seen? Are they
really forms of self-portraiture that I am painting, so that the demand
these pictures will in the end make of their spectators is that each
realigns his or her self-consciousness with the image I am describing?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is one last point to be extracted from the example of the woman in
the caf&eacute;. What we have done is to put the various elements of the
composition in place as means not simply to define a woman in a certain
situation, but more tellingly to identify the represented moment with
another imaginary consciousness--the consciousness of someone also present
at that moment. Yet of course, this sense of the woman as <I>seen</I> and
experienced serves both to qualify and to deepen our sense of her. In
the end the apparently arbitrary detail in the foreground of Degas'
picture proves indispensable to the poignancy of the image. But what if
we had viewed this detail from the point-of-view of a more conventional
representation? For instance, imagine what would happen were we to
insinuate into Lungren's picture a device like the newspaper invading
Degas' composition from its left-hand edge. The effect, I suspect, would
be one of dissonance and dislocation. Lungren's composition speaks to a
kind of naturalistic mind-set in which such disruptive pictorial events
have no place.

Viewed from within just such a mind-set, Degas' portrait of Carlo
Pellegrini shows a picture of a man so cruelly tortured and monstrously
distorted that his left foot grows directly out of his right shin
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_1.html"> 11</A>). Of course, it is actually nothing of the sort. Carlo Pellegrini
happened to be a very small man. The conventional means of making a man
look small would be to show him in relation to something measurable, like
a doorway. Degas does something different: he shows how Pellegrini might
look to a man of normal height standing beside him. Such a person would
be looking down at a steep angle, the ground plane would appear sharply
inclined, and the small man's feet would appear placed as they do in the
picture. By this means the property of smallness is attributed by the
viewer to Pellegrini and becomes as it were his pictorial possession--a
possession he is allowed to carry with a certain style. But a considerable
risk is taken in the process, for the extraordinary profile that Degas
creates around his re is not one we can easily confirm by reference
to our ordinary perceptions. It is a significant difference between
quotidian sight and artistic representation that the mind tends to
adjust for angle of vision even before such effects are registered, so
that images such as this remain as it were unseen. The risk, then, is
that we will fail to trust the picture's interest in its subject; that
we will accordingly refuse to follow the imaginative instructions of
the composition, and that we will insist on seeing the image literally,
which is to say as distorted. (His readiness to take such risks is a
factor serving significantly to distinguish Degas' drawing not only from

<B></B>

the academic practice of the time but also from the work of all his
avant-garde contemporaries with the exception of C&eacute;zanne.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may help to make clear the direction of my argument if I recapitulate
the points these various examples are intended to convey. First I
have proposed that the question of how women look is central to the
development of modern painting. Second I have proposed that this
question is typically addressed not simply through the picturing of
women, but more significantly through the evocation of complex states
of self-consciousness on the part of an imaginary viewer. Third, I have
intended to show that if the actual spectator is to gain imaginative
access to these states it will not be enough just to see what the picture
depicts. What will be required is response to the work of art in its
entirety, and particularly to its composition and technique. It is
only once the purposes of composition and technique have been properly
taken into account, I suggest, that we can safely speak of distortion
and dislocation, let alone read in motives for such distortions as we
may observe. Fourth, then, if the case against Degas is to rest upon
the supposed distortions practiced upon women in his pictures, the
very least we should ask of those making the case is that they be well
guarded against the dangers of literalism in their readings of pictures
(that they are

<B></B>

not art history's equivalents for Mr Partridge at the performance
of <I>Hamlet</I><B>:</B> unable, for the purposes of criticism, to
distinguish between naturalistic reactions and the effects of artifice).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 We need to be sure, for instance, that they are not imposing as
 conditions of psychological hygiene what are in fact no more than the
 normal habits of vision, entrenched as these tend to be in conservative
 canons of pictorial naturalism. In Degas' work, in particular, it is
 through the very <I>disruption</I> of conventions of naturalism that
 pictured res are endowed with imaginary life and individuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The suggestion to which I have been leading, then, is this. Where Degas'
contemporaries saw the realistic observation of degradation, and where
some of our own contemporaries see the abusive vision of the sadist,
there may actually be something at work in Degas' mature pictures that
is stranger than either; something indicated primarily by the highly
idiosyncratic nature of their drawing and their compositions. They
are driven, I think, by a curiosity which is neither academic nor
self-preserving. "What is it like?" they ask, "What is it like to look
like this?" I will acknowledge that there is nothing in the early
critical commentary on Degas' work that I can use in direct support
of this suggestion. But then we have little reason to suppose that the
literate bourgeois male of the time would have been likely to entertain
such a question in front of a picture of a woman. And it is a part of
the burden of my thesis that Degas' work was highly exceptional.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I turn now more directly to the subject of Degas' nudes and to the
question of their implication in the prostitution of women, and more
explicitly the relationship between those works that are quite clearly
identifiable as scenes from the brothel and those that show individual
women washing, bathing, toweling themselves, brushing their hair and
getting into bed. The relationship between these two sets of works is
a matter for open inquiry. According to one view they are categorically
distinct.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Thus we might regard the brothel scenes as restricted to works produced
 as monotypes and on a small scale, none of which was publicly exhibited
 in Degas' lifetime (at least so far as can be established from the
 available evidence). And we might place in an entirely separate
 category those works that show single res in apparently private
 settings. These were for the most part executed in large format in
 pastel, and some of the earliest of them were publicly displayed at
 the Eighth Impressionist Exhibition in 1886. According to another
 point of view, however, the two sets of work overlap and are mutually
 implicated. For writers of this persuasion, the technical distinction
 between monotypes and pastels is not to be fudged into a distinction
 between prostitutes and honest women. The intimate subjects of the
 pastels are not such as Degas could have studied in the decorous
 confines of a bourgeois home, or even in a studio conducted according
 to the decorum of the time. In order to gain a pictorial access to the
 life they represent, so the argument goes, he either paid prostitutes
 to pose for him, or effectively prostituted his models, which amounts
 to the same thing.

We can deal first with the more clear-cut cases. Several of the extant
monotypes are clearly based on observations made in brothels. The largest
of them is little more

<B> [Begin Page 75]</B>

than two feet square, the majority only six or eight inches across. They
show women waiting in the salon, greeting potential customers (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 12</A>),
partying for the benefit of clients, offering themselves for sex, and in
a few cases actually engaged in sex, though it is sex of a thoroughly
desultory sort. Some show women washing or dressing their hair while
clients watch, thus encouraging a reading of the larger pastels as
representations of sights seen by voyeurs (<A HREF="6.3harrison_3.html"> 13</A>). The prostitutes are
for the most part drawn with the conventional appurtenances of sexual
prettiness--long hair, stockings, ribbons around their throats--but they
are neither posed nor represented as beauties. Indeed, they are not posed
at all. These are rapidly executed monotypes, we should remember, not
studied studio drawings. Some of the women are characterized as tired,
worn and middle-aged. When we consider modern art's inquiry into the
matter of how women look, then, these images too are to be taken into
account (<A HREF="6.3harrison_4.html"> 14</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As for the men, they could hardly be said to profit by the comparison. As
Degas shows them they are for the most part ugly, aging, balding and
uncomfortably overdressed, and they are always absurd. It is all much as
one might expect. Yet it is easy to understand that such pictures could
not have been publicly shown in the later nineteenth century. They would

<B></B>

presumably have been condemned as obscene. They are not obscene,
however. What they are is both more matter-of-fact and more richly
steeped in the materials of irony than any public discourse on sexual
morality is ever allowed to be. Technically they combine decorative
vitality with an incisiveness of observation that continually skirts the
margins of caricature. But whatever they are, they are not scenarios that
Degas was responsible for inventing. Nor are they pictures of distorted
women. Indeed, I can see nothing in Degas' drawing of these res
to justify the suggestion that he was involved in the degradation and
abuse of the women they depict. Rather these images seem refreshingly
resistant to the easy assumption that prostitution is just one thing,
making just one kind of stain on the social tableau, a prostitute just
one kind of person engaged in just one form of activity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 As Norma Broude has noted, if Degas was not himself a feminist,
 there were those among his acquaintances who were. One of these, Diego
 Martelli, was actively engaged in campaigning both for the liberalization
 of laws by which prostitutes were persecuted, and, more tellingly, for
 recognition of the extent to which women in general were effectively
 prostituted by marriage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Martelli lived for thirty years with a woman he had met in a brothel. His
 picture by Degas hangs in Edinburgh. We look in vain for signs of the
 sitter's shame or the artist's disapproval.

Before we leave the brothel scenes there is one point worthy of
note. A few of them show women relaxing in what appear to be off-duty
moments. But either the women appear in twos and threes, or if alone
they are represented in such a way as to assume a viewpoint directed
upon them. In none of the brothel scenes, in other words, is a woman
shown to be the sole occupant of her own space. What Degas' pictures

<B></B>

make clear is that whatever the prostitutes are doing in them, even
if they are literally doing nothing, they are always and everywhere
available to be looked at (<A HREF="6.3harrison_5.html"> 15</A>).

The pastels are for the most part much larger. In some of them the res
are almost life-size. Yet these res are generally set much closer to
the picture plane, they occupy far more of the total represented space
and, crucially, they tend not to be prefaced by the kinds of situational
cues by means of which the position of an imaginary spectator would
normally be established. I should try to make clearer just what I mean. In
the <I>Dancer in her Dressing Room</I> in Winterthur the half-open door
at the right serves to define a position outside looking in, and thus to
render the dancer the explicit object of an interested regard--very much
the same kind of regard, in fact, as that to which the single res of
prostitutes are subject in their moments of quasi-isolation (<A HREF="6.3harrison_6.html"> 16</A>). We
might go so far as to say that it is not so much the dancer herself as
the experience of seeing her that the picture is concerned with. If we
now compare the <I>Bather with a Towel</I> from the Metropolitan Museum
in New York I think we will find it much harder to separate sensation
of the re from the re seen (<A HREF="6.3harrison_7.html"> 17</A>). There is no cued external
position  to help us prize the two apart. Unlike the door, the
towel attaches to the woman's torso; it remains, as it were, a condition
of the body's imagined sensation of its own surface. In fact the more
we look at the pastels of bathing women the clearer this difference
becomes. All those pictorial furnishings and foreground devices that
normally serve to orient the spectator relative to the pictured re
are here made to serve a quite different end: they function, in fact, to
suggest, to define and to qualify the sensuous self-absorption of the
represented re. Thus, in the large pastel in the National Gallery,
London (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 2</A>), as in the related picture in the Courtauld Institute,
the ensembles of re, towels,

<B>[End Page 77 Begin Page 79]</B>

and tub chair constitute an enclosed and self-sufficient tactile
world. Similarly, in each of the long series of drawings of a woman
bending to dry her feet, the position of her buttocks relative to the
rim of the bath is established with minute care, as if the vitality of
the re as a whole were assured by the sensation of their contact
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_8.html"> 18</A>).

I will try to be explicit in the conclusion I draw from these various
observations. In the matter of how women look, there was no equal
distribution of powers in Degas' day. This inequality was exploited in
a great deal of painting produced in the later nineteenth century, much
of it trivially meretricious, some of it seriously absurd.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 In the work of a few remarkable artists, however, the inequality
 was acknowledged and its conditions laid open to imaginative
 reconstruction. In the work of Manet and Degas it was made clear that
 the exchange of glances was never an exchange conducted on level terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Each in his own way worked to imagine and to represent what it must
 be like always to be looked at. Each in his own way questioned that
 hypocritical system of thought according to which a prostitute could not
 be allowed to be attractive (<A HREF="6.3harrison_9.html"> 19</A>). Each, in allowing the represented
 prostitute to appear human, offered the actual male viewer an image of
 himself as the imaginary abuser.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But Degas, I think, went further. The evidence is there in the
 pictures if we can only read them on their own terms. I will make
 my point in the form of a question. Given the conditions we have
 been considering--conditions in which the look of women was an issue
 bearing crucially upon the success or failure of a painting--what if an
 artist took it in mind to paint a woman who was <I>not</I> being looked
 at? A woman, that is to say, who was allowed to be the unselfconscious
 possessor of her own space, her own body? How might he go about it? Of
 course the enterprise would be deeply paradoxical and ambivalent, since
 the end result must always be a visible image. But it might be possible,
 at least, to counter the presupposition of the eternal male spectator
 in the picture; to fill his conventional place with other stuff; to
 summon up whatever normally served to indicate his presence and to
 replace it; even, if necessary, to employ a chaperone to displace him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 But what would first and foremost have to be achieved is an almost
 unprecedented act of imagination enacted by means of a highly practiced
 technique. There could be no effective dislocation of the spectator
 unless the pictured woman were shown--albeit quasi-metaphorically--to
 be in possession of herself<B>;</B> unless her self-absorption could
 be convincingly rendered.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This rendering would require two distinctive forms of competence. Firstly,
it would require knowledge--knowledge sufficient to produce a realistic
re in the absence of that re's supposed referent in the actual
world. And how could such knowledge be gained without an apparently
obsessive working and reworking of the body's real  appearance? It
is highly significant in this respect that the great majority of Degas'
finished pastels of women are complex variations on life studies or
photographs, often derived from successive tracings. That is to say,
they are made from other pictures, not directly from posed models.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Secondly, it would require that the literal surface of the picture be
 endowed with extraordinary metaphorical potential--the potential to
 evoke another's bodily sensation. It was to this end, I think, that
 Degas so busily animated the surfaces of his pastels. It mattered less
 that they should

<B></B>

capture the naturalistic conrations of the body than that they
should convey that body's radiant warmth, its tension and relaxation,
its balance or stability, its own responsiveness to texture and to touch.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is a supreme and ghastly irony that when these works were first
exhibited the commentators for the most part read their surfaces
literally. What they saw was the labored texture. They saw it as blotchy
skin--"the streetwalker's  modern, swollen, pasty flesh," to quote
one writer on the Impressionist Exhibition of 1886.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was the same, of course, with the reading of the res' poses. What
the viewers saw was res in poses they were unable to recognize as
natural. They thus interpreted the res as ugly and explained their
ugliness as the sign of prostitution. In fact the reason the viewers
were unable to see the women as ordinary was not that their poses
were unnatural in the sense of having no straightforward biological or
aesthetic justification; it was because they failed to conform to the
conventional means of organizing women into pictures. Of course, this
was precisely the point. How is a woman to be shown <I>in art</I> as if
she were alone and not being seen? The answer is that she must be shown
as not <I>arranged</I> to be seen, not displayed, not

<B></B>

already aestheticised--she must appear, in fact, as if not posed. Hence
the unusual requirements that Degas made of his actual models; the
traditionally  comfortable and sustainable poses of the studio were
just those that his enterprise must rule out. We may feel some sympathy
for those actual women who were conscripted into an endeavor they are
unlikely to have understood. But only an eagerness to condemn could lead
us to conceive of that endeavor as a debasing and abusive social practice.

In fact for some of his most uncanonical res Degas used
photographs. The extraordinary work from Philadelphia is a case in point
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_0.html"> 20</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 The nature of the artist's interest in photography may be used to
 advance my argument. There were two significant aspects to this
 interest. On the one hand, Degas made use of what would have been
 considered at the time the accidental effects of the photograph: the
 blurring of a limb in movement, the disappearance of a detail into a
 halo of light, the cropping of a re caught moving into or out of
 the frame. On the other, he informed himself of the scientific work of
 Muybridge and Marey. The particular relevance of this work is that it
 employed photographic techniques as a means of studying a world beyond
 the normally visible. Like those amateurish snapshots that caught
 res in accidental movement, what the images of Muybridge and Marey
 recorded was a range of movements and positions outside those canonized
 in normal vision.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The end that photography served for Degas was thus to furnish him
 with powerful

<B></B>

resources for the critique of naturalistic conventions. For example, it
clearly went against the taste of the time to conceive of the pastel now
in the Metropolitan Museum in New York as a naturalistic picture of an
ordinary woman entering a bath (<A HREF="6.3harrison_1.html"> 21</A>). But photography will show, and
an unbiased eye will eventually learn to see, that this is indeed how a
conventionally attractive woman may look. The re is neither debased
by the effects of prostitution nor distorted by the artist's misogyny. She
is simply uncanonized, unposed, and thus <I>not being seen.</I>

It is nearly time to return to the monotype with which I began. There is
one last issue to address. It concerns Degas' motivation. This question
is most urgently raised, I think, by those images that seem to fall
somewhere between the brothel monotypes and the large pastels. Though
smaller and less heavily worked than the latter, they lack the appearance
of spontaneity and near-caricature by which the former tend to be
distinguished. One of the most remarkable of them is a small image
developed in pastel over the faint second impression of a monotype. It
shows a woman washing at a bidet--a moment that the typical male
imagination holds as paradigmatic of feminine physical privacy (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 22</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are two different kinds of conclusion we might draw from such
images. If it is allowed that the pastels can justifiably be regarded
as attempts to explore how women look when they are not being seen,
this would still leave the matter of the "heterosexual drive" to be
answered. It might be said that all I have done is add substance to the
very view I was concerned to oppose: the view that what these pictures

<B></B>

do is bring artistic sophistication to the proclivities of the voyeur. In
other words, for all that the skills involved may be exceptional, what
they are being used for is to pry into the most private of moments;
to appropriate even the woman's own bodily sensation, and to render it
consumable by the male spectator.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The main objection to this conclusion is that voyeurism, as conventionally
understood, is by its very nature unsympathetic. That's to say its aim
is not to recognize the distinctive nature of the other's experience,
but rather to conscript that experience as a form of exciting narrative
within one's own. Whatever artists may or may not wish to do, aesthetic
success and failure are at any given time relative to certain material
conditions. If I am right about the conditions bearing down upon
the French art of the later nineteenth century, a predisposition to
unsympathetic voyeurism would not have been an advantage. My contention
is that by the mid 1880s the ability to represent the female re as
the sole possessor of her own space and body was an <I>aesthetic</I>
requirement that the work of Degas and others was bound to face. (It may
be significant that it is at around this same time that Degas' dancers
tend to step out of the spotlight and into the wings, where, out of
sight of the audience, they become pre-occupied with the details of
their costumes and their coiffeurs.

<B></B>

For examples, compare the <I>Curtseying Danseuse with Bouquet</I> of
1878, in the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, with the <I>Danseuses bleues</I> of
ca. 1890 from the same collection or with the <I>Red Ballet Skirts</I>
of ca. 1897-1901 from the Burrell Collection.) I suppose that what
I am saying in the end is that the issue gets decided aesthetically, on
the basis of results. Aesthetic achievement, then, would have to be seen
as a measure of avoidance of voyeurism. If that is indeed the case, then
a reading that would insist on the implicit violence of these images is
one that must deny such aesthetic properties as they may have in order
to protect <I>assumptions</I> about their motivation.

I return, then, to the question of what it is that drives this art--if
it is not an ultimately voyeuristic and prurient interest. My answer
would be that they are driven both by desire and by imagination. A desire
that that which they show <I>might</I> be capable of being seen; and an
imaginative insight into the conditions required if that possibility were
to be realized. It may well be that in the 1880s only a woman who was
a prostitute could have allowed Degas to see that which is pictured in
the image of the woman at the bidet. But a picture for which a prostitute
models is not necessarily a picture of a prostitute, any more than the sad
woman in the caf&eacute; was a portrait of the actress Ellen Andr&eacute;,
who actually posed for it. In fact what the worked-over monotype shows is
a sight now open to association with the conjugal intimacy of a shared
bedroom, rather than the hygiene of the prostitute. In this respect we
are perhaps  luckier than the men and women of Degas' day. Time
has passed. Of course paintings cannot predict the future. What they can
do, however, is to show what is lacking from the present, though in the
process they may render their critical content virtually imperceptible to
their contemporary spectators. It is for this reason that the testimony
of the artist's own time proves so frequently unreliable as a guide to
interpretation. Is it so inconceivable that Degas could have understood
the grounds of his own misfortune; understood them and tried to imagine
them realistically transformed? Might it not be that this is what his
mature pictures show? That if a woman's intimacy were really her own,
then an equal exchange of intimacies might realistically be imagined
and the "moment with infinite content" might become more than just a
glance. Degas was certainly clear enough in his earlier work about what
life must be like where there is neither empathy nor true intimacy. The
conclusions are unmistakable both from his formal family portraits
(see <I>The Belleli Family,</I> Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay) and from the two
essays in genre painting known respectively as <I>Interior</I> (or more
dramatically and probably misleadingly as <I>The Rape</I>) and <I>Sulking</I> (respectively, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and Museum of
Art, Philadelphia).
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 It is also very clear from the evidence of his work that he could imagine
 what it was like when the absence of self-possession left women condemned
 to a public isolation  (<A HREF="6.3harrison_3.html"> 23</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I should perhaps try to put some form of theoretical scaffolding under
the conjectural aspects of this paper. Of course it would be a nonsense to
claim that we could now straightforwardly recover what was not visible to
the contemporary spectator of Degas' work. It may be, however, that we can
recover it as a form of understanding of what it was that was then <I>not
to be seen.</I> To the extent that it is sensible to talk in such terms,
we exercise a kind of interpretive competence which the painting may

<B></B>

originally have put itself beyond. Of course there are limits on
the competences we can bring to bear, as there are on our capacity
practically to imagine, for example, what it is like to inhabit the body
of another. But it is precisely at the limits on and of the imagination
that art does its most indispensable critical work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The argument may be put in the form of a series of theses.  The
intensional properties of a painting, or, if we avoid pandering to a
prissy prejudice, its qualities are <I>produced</I> properties. They are
constitutive and definitive of the painting.  These properties are not
necessarily to be identified with such properties as may be predicated
of the painting or attributed to it, since they may be such that they
are not to be seen in advance of some transformation in the spectator,
some self-critical process or other process of edification.  The
painting whose properties are not to be seen (by the spectator) will
be described and interpreted (by that spectator) as that which it is
not.   To perceive that a description or interpretation of a painting
is a description or interpretation of that which it is not, is to act
under an intuition of that which is not to be seen. We might call this
intuition "aesthetic."  This intuition implies some convergence
between that which is not to be seen (or said of) the

<B></B>

painting, and that which is not to be seen in (or said of) the world
of the spectator.  It does not follow that the properties of the
painting are <I>relative</I> to what may be seen and said in the world
of the spectator.  A painting may serve to divide its spectators into
(i) those who cannot see it and will not see it and who must therefore
describe it as that which it is not; (ii) those who cannot see it, but
who nevertheless do not describe it as that which it is not (and who are
thus pre-transformational from the point of view of the painting); (iii)
those who can see it and who are thus post-transformational from the point
of view of the painting.  The transformation involved is one that the
painting specifically requires by virtue of its produced properties. The
process might be thought of as the coming-to-awareness of an unconscious
intention, where intention is conceived of as a historical rather than
merely psychological category.  The possibility of transformation in
the spectator may entail the capacity to imagine himself or herself either
as pictured or as seeing what is pictured (or otherwise represented), or
both.  Imagination of this order has conventionally been conceived
of as a form of empathy. However, we need a way of thinking of the
mechanisms involved that does not tend to sentimentalisation of the
forms of experience at issue, and that is not diverting--as empathy
tends to be--from the formal and pictorial instruction of the relevant
imaginative activity, i. e. from the painting's effect.  Any effect
we attribute specifically to painting will be a function of some playing
on the relationship between picture plane and literal surface.  To
talk of painting as an art is to imply that this game is such as in turn
to problematize the relations between (i) that which is normally to be
seen and represented according to the culturally available resources of
expression in the practical world from which the painting issues, and
that which is not; (ii) the painting in question and other paintings;
(iii) the spectator and other paintings; iv) the world of that which the
spectator can see (and describe and interpret) and that which he or she
cannot see (and etc.).  To imply that a painting produced at time
T1 can have as one of its produced properties the capacity to challenge
resources of expression at time T2 would be to attribute to paintings
the capacity to predict the future. The challenge in question may be
conceived of as a constant property <I>only</I> to the extent that the
need to represent that which is not to be seen is discoverable under
different social and historical conditions.  These may also be the
limits according to which what has been called aesthetic experience may
justifiably be conceived of as a constant in human cultures.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, then, to the monotype which started all this. It may by now how
have become clear where my argument has been leading, and how I mean to
explain the sense of blindness that the monotype momentarily induced in
me. Of course, it would be easiest to step back and to play the voyeur,
with all that that would imply for our understanding of the artist's
desire in producing his picture--and for all that it might suggest about
the nature of his exchanges with his friends. But in fact the composition
offers us no space to retreat to. There is even less than in the large
pastels. It is not simply that this is an image without an external
spectator, though I think it is certainly and crucially that. This is
a body seen from the virtual position of its

<B></B>

own head. And what would it mean for the male spectator to occupy that
position? To look down the body of the other as if from within its
own imagined self-consciousness? What would it be like to look like
that? Rather than writing from certainty either about the artist's
mentality or about our own appearance, perhaps, like Degas, we should
try to see.

. The 1977 article sought to question the assumption of Degas'
misogyny which had been prevalent since the first exhibition of his
"suite de nues" in the 1886 Impressionist exhibition. The later review
notes the reinstallation of a Degas "framed as the perverted instrument
of society's power structures and obsessions" in some recent writing
by feminist art historians . The review provides a useful summary
of some of the issues raised in interpretation of Degas' work, with

Wollheim's concept of the "spectator in the picture" is discussed at
length in ch. 3 of his <I>Painting as an Art (</I>Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press, 1987)<I>.</I> His claim is that there are
certain paintings that have "a representational content in excess of
what they represent"  and that this is to be accounted for by
the presence of an imaginary spectator who, though unrepresented, is
"internal" to the given picture. That is to say, the picture may be
imagined as showing not only what this spectator sees but <I>how</I> he
or she sees it. Wollheim characterizes the "spectator in the picture"
as a "protagonist" to whom a "repertoire" is assigned by the artist
. "The external spectator identifies with the internal spectator,
and it is through this identification that he gains fresh access to
the picture's content. In a licensed way he supplements his perception
of the picture with the proceeds of imagination and does so so as to
advance understanding" . As Wollheim applies the concept of the
"spectator in the picture" it is subject to a problematic and conservative
limitation: it is established solely through the rative scenario of
the given picture. It is thus not clear how the effect of the picture's
factive aspects might combine with the effect of the external spectator's
identification with the internal spectator to produce understanding
of the picture. The question is a crucial one where Degas' pastels
are concerned. In no pictorial work--with the possible exception of
C&eacute;zanne's--is the repertoire of the "spectator in the picture"
so clearly qualified or challenged by the expressive properties of the
literal worked surface. Yet if the spectator in the picture could be
allowed to meet this qualification or challenge there seems no reason
why the concept should not be extended to such <I>non</I>-rative
paintings as those of Rothko, to which it seems highly appropriate.

This painting was discussed by Neil MacGregor, Director of the National
Gallery, London, in the first program of the televised series <I>Making
Masterpieces</I> on BBC2 on 20 October 1997. Drawing upon a recent
examination by the gallery's scientific department and conservation
studio, MacGregor noted the alterations by which Renoir had "dressed
down" the main re to lower her class and to make more poignant her
apparent discomfort at the attentions of the man behind her. "Is this
the first politically correct painting?" he asked, concluding, "It may
well be." The sound-bite gets the painting half right. But, <I>pace</I>
Wollheim, we need to remember that a picture is always first and most
crucially seen by the person who both makes and imagines it from a
position this side of its surface. If I am justified in my reading of
the painting and its critical connection to de Molins' earlier work, it
is to the man <I>in front</I> of the pictured woman that we should look
for the true--and more complex--source of her discomfort. It is <I>his</I> motivated inquisitiveness about the girl's social and economic
position that the alterations to her costume and her bodily demeanor
serve most tellingly to establish. (See the clearly managed review of
MacGregor's program in David Lister, "A Study in Sexual Politics," <I>Guardian</I>, 16 October 1977, "Eye on Thursday section," 1.)

The locus classicus for this reading is Joris-Karl Huysmans' essay on
the pastels, first published as "Degas" in his <I>Certains</I> (Paris:

<I>Art in Theory 1815-1900</I> (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998),
893-95. Huysmans writes of the artist's "painstaking cruelty and
unshakeable hatred." Martha Ward has provided a thorough analysis of
critical responses to the showing of Degas' "suite de nues" at the eighth
Impressionist exhibition in 1886, demonstrating how assumptions about
the artist's misogyny were variously connected to characterizations of
the poverty, ugliness, and amorality of the represented women, with the
typical consequence that the images were read as harshly "realistic." See
"The Rhetoric of Independence and Innovation" in <I>The New Painting:

Anthea Callen writes of "anatomical distortions which flatten and fix the
re into a shallow pictorial space," cataloguing the "distortions" in
various pictures by reference to an assumed biological naturalism. She
then explains the distortions in question in terms of a desire on Degas'
part both to contain female sexuality and literally to manipulate the
female anatomy ("Degas' <I>Bathers</I>: Hygiene and Dirt--Gaze and
Touch," 168-70). In her more sophisticated treatment of the same
issue, Heather Dawkins remarks that ". . . as many have noticed, Degas'
sense of the body, especially from the 1870s, was very tenuous: anatomies
under <I>tutus</I> are implausible, legs join to torsos problematically,
women stepping in or out of baths threaten to split up the middle, and
so on." Sensibly opposing those who would attribute the "tenuousness" of
Degas' sense of the body to "lack of representational skill," Dawkins
explains it rather in terms of "the necessity for a constant deferral
of gratification in fantasy . . . met in part by the necessary phobic
avoidance of the object in projection" (Dawkins, "Frogs, Monkeys and
Women: A History of Identification across a Phantastic Body," <I>Dealing
with Degas</I>, 206-10). That psychic projection played some part in
Degas' work seems plausible enough. It presumably does in everyone's. The
point at issue is how we are to isolate the significant effects of that
projection, <I>in the absence</I> of some adequate theory of artistic
style and some relevant account of its development (i.e. without some
possibility of eliminating the effects of our own projections). To put
the matter bluntly, with such theoretical instruments to hand, what
might someone <I>not</I> make of the work of Picasso or Matisse or Dali
or etc. in the 1920s? We should also bear in mind that the Wollheimian
concept of the spectator in the picture has considerable potential to
damage interpretations such as those of Callen and Dawkins, based as
these are on the assumption that it is the artist's unreflected motivation
that the forms of his pictures express (see note 11).

Powerful evidence of misogyny and sadism is certainly there to be
found in the French painting of the nineteenth century. The imaginative
anticipation of acts of rape was regularly on offer in paintings exhibited
at the Salon, from Marc Gleyre's deeply unpleasant <I>Roman bandits</I>
of 1831 (now in the Cleveland Museum) to Paul-Joseph Jamin's fatuous
<I>The Brennus with his Share of the Spoils</I> of 1893 (now Mus&eacute;e
des Beaux-Arts, La Rochelle). Unwillingness to make discriminations on
aesthetic grounds is often raised to the status of a principle in cultural
studies. I would want to propose, however, that aesthetic difference is
the surest guide to <I>other</I> kinds of difference between pictures
such as Gleyre's and Jamin's on the one hand and those of a Manet or a
Degas on the other.

  Confronted with Degas' sketch of <I>Woman With a Lorgnette</I>
(ca. 1866 British Museum, London) in the 1988 exhibition at the Grand
Palais in Paris, Griselda Pollock interprets it and its related studies
of a woman looking directly out of the picture not as indications that
Degas might possibly have got there before her in critical reflection
upon the distribution of powers in "the Gaze and the Look," but as
further evidence of the artist's need that the look be "captured and
tamed" ("The Gaze and the Look: Women with Binoculars--A Question of
Difference," <I>Dealing With Degas</I>, 106-130). One is reminded

Manet's <I>Blonde aux Seins Nues</I> is a picture of an attractive
woman whose breasts have clearly been bared to be seen (she still wears
blouse and hat)<I>.</I> While it breaches the decorum for a respectable
portrait, the explicitly self-conscious expression of the woman lifts it
out of the category of a mere life study from a professional model. In
the 1870s there were few other social categories to which the woman could
be assigned apart from that of prostitute. But in cultural circumstances
in which prostitutes were publicly supposed to be ugly and bestial, what
was the male viewer to do with a picture which reflected back <I>both</I>
his own attraction to the woman <I>and</I> her psychological remoteness

There is considerable evidence that Degas associated the conventions of
direct life study with a tendency for <I>loss</I> of expressive potential
in the whole re. His notebooks of 1877-83 record the following
"studio projects" in the form of admonitions to himself. "Set up tiered
benches round the room to get in the habit of drawing things from below
and from above. Only be allowed to paint things seen in a mirror so
as to instal a hatred of <I>trompe l'oeil</I>. For a portrait have the
re pose on the ground floor and have to work on the first floor to
get used to keeping a grasp of the forms and expressions, never drawing
or painting <I>directly</I>." (Author's translation from <I>Art in Theory
