<p class="noIndent">
In the first decades of the twentieth century, F.T. Marinetti's futurist cheer, "Hurrah for motors," collided against Victorian invocations of spirituality&#x02014;or so the period divide is often oversimplified.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Performers and artists during the period, however, did not adhere to assumed antagonisms between spirituality and materiality, human culture and the machine age, or the soul and the motor. "I must place a motor in my soul," declares the American-born dancer, Isadora Duncan (1877&#x02013;1927) in her 1927 autobiography, and she consistently positions her choreography at the juncture of motorized movement and soulful expression. Her efforts to reimagine spirit through machine processes are shared by many key res of modernism, including the Russian director Constantin Stanislavski and even Marinetti. Although Duncan is credited with the invention of the performance form now called "modern dance," her influence on modernist performance has not been recognized. Her theories are dismissed as "romantic grandiloquence,"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  primarily due to her use of terms associated with Victorianism ("soul," "inner self," and "human spirit").<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Even the best critical studies argue that Duncan "never completed the leap" from "late-nineteenth-century-romanticism" 

<b></b>

to modernism's "secular collectivism" (DID, 220). Yet, this presumed secularity is belied by the Christian and classical interests of res such as T.S. Eliot and H.D., and the notion of a divide between Victorianism and modernism to be leapt across has been questioned by Michael Levenson and others.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Duncan's conjuncture of metaphysical and materialist thought is actually a dominant feature of twentieth-century art, shared by such diverse movements as Italian futurism, the Moscow Art Theatre's innovations in drama, Greenwich Village Radicalism, and U.S. feminism.
</p>

<p>
As the motor in the soul indicates, Duncan'sideas of spirit are grounded in twentieth-century movement practices and especially that icon of modernist industrial society, the motor. This essay locates Duncan in the context of modernist performance by tracing her influences on more canonical res, recognizing that her dances represent a diverse body of choreography that developed and responded to modernist aesthetics, and reading her many essays and speeches as attempts to theorize her practice. <sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Duncan repeatedly res her fundamental movement principles through the symbol of the motor. First, the motor's ability to move several objects suggests the possibility of representing a "multiplied body," an interest she shared with Marinetti and other futurists. The constant, tireless motion of the motorized machine also offers the ideal of continuous dance movements that appear to be executed effortlessly, without the intervention of the "will," a concept she derives from Friedrich Nietzsche. Third, the motor's repetitive motion inspires Duncan's rehearsal process and desire to simulate spontaneity, a goal that significantly influenced Stanislavski's acting theory. As the "Muse of Modernism," an international star, and a polemical speaker, Duncan's motorized movement practices shaped modernist understandings of the body and soul, influenced spheres of performance from futurism to method acting, and launched an important trajectory of feminism.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
An overview of Duncan's career reveals that she was performing simultaneously with the most significant gestures of aesthetic modernism. Like many key modernist literary res, Duncan left the United States and began her career in Europe, arriving in London in 1899. By 1908, Duncan was touring the U.S. with an established reputation in Europe, and John Butler Yeats, father of the poet, added his sketch to the many images of her by Abraham Walkowitz, John Sloan, Jos&#x000E9; Clar&#x000E1;, Auguste Rodin, and Gordon Craig (IDA, 35&#x02013;63). Also in 1908, Duncan developed a close friendship with Constantin Stanislavski, introduced the acting theorist to Gordon Craig, and initiated their collaboration on the 1912 Moscow Art Theatre production of <i>Hamlet</i>.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The 1914 publications of the first Imagist anthology and the Vorticist <i>Blast</i> marked Duncan's famous choreography to <i>Ave Maria</i> (Schubert), a tribute to her children who drowned after their car plunged into the Seine. With the onset of World War I, Duncan choreographed the political <i>Marseillaise</i> , set to the French national anthem and designed to arouse support for U.S. involvement in the Allied cause. In 1917, the year Marinetti discussed her art in "Manifesto of the Futurist Dance," Duncan became interested in the Russian Revolution, and her piece, <i>Revolutionary</i> (Scriabin, 1924), depicting a worker's awakening self-consciousness, reveals her engagement in the political debates of her time. The 1922 publications of <i>The Waste Land</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> 

<b></b>

correspond to Duncan's marriage to Russian poet, Serge Esenin, and her controversial American tour leading to accusations of communist sympathies and the loss of her U.S. citizenship. Duncan died in 1927 in a highly publicized accident when her scarf became entangled in the wheel of a car and broke her neck.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Duncan's historical period is obviously modernism, but periodization would be insignificant if it were determined simply by dates. Duncan's art has not been considered sufficiently modernist, in part, because aspects of her dance became common practice and other features have been overlooked. She developed an innovative performance form: the solo dance choreographed to romantic music (Chopin, Wagner) followed by curtain call speeches.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Although soloists became common in modern dance with Martha Graham and Ruth St. Dennis, the shock of Duncan's single female body dancing on the stage was frequently the focus of both complimentary and negative reviews.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Similarly, classical music has become a staple accompaniment to modern dance, but Duncan's use of "high music" was extremely controversial. Carl Van Vechten, reviewer for the <i>New York Times</i>, protested the "sacrilege" of her musical choices for her 1909 performances at the Metropolitan Opera House, claiming that Gluck's "Iphig&#x000E9;nie en Aulide" was "never designed for dancing."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  By July 1917, however, Van Vechten was applauding Duncan's new experiments: "More than the dance this new art partakes of the fluid and unending quality of music. Like any other new art it is not to be understood at first and I confess in the beginning it said nothing to me . . . "<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Here, Van Vechten frames Duncan's performances as a new art, as does Duncan in her curtain-call speeches, the final element of her performance form.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Duncan's speeches educate her audience as they explain and defend her choreography, theories of education, and political positions. In a speech delivered during her unsuccessful American tour of October 1922, Duncan recognizes her curtain call statements as integral to her performance, in spite of the protests of her manager, Sol Hurok: "My manager tells me that if I make more speeches the tour is dead. Very well, the tour is dead!" (IS, 138). The speeches were also central to Duncan's thought and often served as seeds for expanded essays.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Duncan's speeches consistently mix metaphysical (soul) and materialist (motor) concepts and have therefore been dismissed as "grandiloquence." Yet her brief polemical statements can be better understood in the context of the modernist manifesto, a performative genre employed by contending avant-garde groups.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Attempting to transform political argumentation into a theatrical construct, manifestos were published in a layout designed to shout in print and performed by Marinetti and others after 1910.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The performed manifesto was a crucial component of early modernism's jostling for social, literary, and danced positions. All factions, however, shared hostility for elements of "tradition," and Duncan also rails against the entrenched forms of dance, most notably ballet. Just as Marinetti asks, "Why poison ourselves? Why rot?" by touring museums (VP, 88), Duncan insists, "I do not mean to say <i>copy</i> it, <i>imitate</i> it; but to <i>breathe its life</i>, <i>to recreate it in one's self with personal inspiration</i>."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Additionally, Marinetti's manifestos and Duncan's speeches both establish a relation of provocation and effrontery to the audience, a stance that is at odds with images of Duncan as the flitting Victorian nymph. With manifesto-like disdain, Duncan insults her audience: "Thank God the 

<b></b>

Boston critics don't like me. If they did I should feel I was hopeless" (IS, 53). Futurist manifestos are known for their celebration of technological achievements, like the motor, which alter the manner of human movement through the world, yet they also draw on metaphysical expressions.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In "The Futurist Cinema," Marinetti admires the filmic media but also describes a "rhythm of soul and rhythm of legs" (SW, 134). The Aerial Futurists of the 1920's "intend to use the plane . . . to express the 'spirit of the epoch.' These pictures therefore break the circle of reality to indicate the mystery of a new spirituality."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The fusion of technology and spirit manifest in Duncan's motor in the soul is evident even among the technophilic futurists.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's practice of giving curtain call speeches predates Marinetti's London manifesto-lectures of 1910, but she became more confrontational as the manifesto fever took hold in the following decade.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  That Marinetti frequently attended Duncan's performances and found them provocative is evident from his little-known "Manifesto of the Futurist Dance" . Discussing her work in relation to futurist performance aesthetics, Marinetti reveals that he admires her "free improvisations" and "free dance," although he considers her "childishly feminine" (SW, 137). Marinetti prefers her contemporary, Lo&#x000EF;e Fuller, because she produces machine-like motions and appears to transcend the constraints of the human body through innovative lighting techniques and mechanisms designed to manipulate yards of cloth skirting. For Marinetti, the futurist dance will "go beyond muscular possibilities," aim for "that ideal <i>multiplied body</i> of the motor," and "imitate the movements of machines" (SW, 138). Although Duncan emphasized the possibilities of the <i>human</i> body and worked for simplicity in her light tunics and stage designs, she influenced the futurist dances of Valentine de Saint-Point and Giannina Censi. Saint-Point's futurist "m&#x000E9;tachorie" (performed between 1913&#x02013;1917) featured a recitation of her poems by a narrator while she performed abstract, geometrical dances thought to be a reaction against Duncan's "childishly feminine" movements. This Duncan stereotype is not accurate, however, and her more weighted, political pieces undoubtedly inspired Saint-Point. Duncan's celebration of the female warrior in <i>The Amazons</i>  and battle cry in <i>Marseillaise</i>  epitomize Saint-Point's <i>Manifesto of the Futurist Woman</i> : "Women are Erinyes, Amazons, Semiramis . . . warriors who t more ferociously than men, lovers who incite, destroyers who contribute towards natural selection by breaking those who are fragile . . . "<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Here, Saint-Point uses Marinetti's rhetoric of violence to oppose his "contempt for women," <sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  and he probably drafted his "Manifesto of Futurist Dance" after her 1917 performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera House in an attempt to control the realm of futurist dance (OCTFM, n.14).
</p>

<p>
Giannina Censi's performances of aerial dances in the 1930's are advertised as the realization of the futurist dance, as she represents the motor's "<i>multiplied body</i>" and imitates the movement of machines, particularly airplanes (OCTFM, 397). Photographs of Censi on a poster for Teatro Garibaldi (1932&#x02013;33) dramatically demonstrate the influence of Duncan's technique, particularly in the pliant chest and back, upward lift of the torso, parallel leg positions, and leg lifts with bent knee. In images from <i>Aerofuturist Dance</i> , Censi kneels on the floor in positions recalling Duncan's innovative floor 

<b></b>

work and poses with her back arched in a position Duncan named the "Bacchante."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Censi uses these motions to interpret the myth of the machine rather than the diverse natural scenes and human dramas of Duncan, but Censi's comments on her dances reveal similarities that complicate the futurist "<i>multiplied body</i>": "everything that the plane did had to be expressed in my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impressions of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled . . . And the face had to express what the pilot felt" (OCTFM, 400). The "multiplied body" of the futurist dancer does not simply imitate machines or the motor's autonomous moving parts; Censi represents the pilot in the machine, the plane's movements as it encounters other forces and "trembles," and her own experience of the plane. Anja Kl&#x000F6;ck states that these performances "blur the boundaries between woman and machine, materiality and spirituality, mind and body, signifier and signified" (OCTFM, 408).
</p>

<p>
This sense of the body that represents multiple material and spiritual elements is an important feature of Duncan's dance aesthetics, and one that Censi may have inherited along with Duncan's technique, but then applied to the machine. In her early Schubert Waltz, <i>Water Study</i> , Duncan choreographs the crashing of waves, the spiral motion of an eddy, and the drawing current, but the dancer is also variously a person playing in the water and a seagull skimming its surface. She achieves this effect by dividing the body so that parts simultaneously express different energies or emotions. Renowned second generation Duncan dancer, Julia Levien, describes this difficult element of Duncan technique as the use of several "voices of the body."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In <i>Water Study</i>,the feet follow a standard three beat waltz rhythm while the arms and torso express the lyrical, flowing melody.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Another corporal opposition develops as the ribs and torso shift away from the center of the body, thereby pulling the dancer off-balance as if she has been struck by a wave. The feet follow to catch the body, the dynamic of fall and recovery adds more undulations to those of the torso, and the danceexplores all movements related to water.
</p>

<p>
Another manifestation of the "multiplied body" in Duncan's practice is her ideal of a dance that can encompass several bodies and represent numerous characters in a given story. She famously claims, "I never danced a solo,"<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  and describes a "feeling of multiple oneness" while dancing as the fifty daughters of Danaus in <i>The Suppliants of Aeschylus</i> (ML, 100): "At the end of <i>Iphigenia</i> the maids of Tauris dance in bacchanalian joy for the rescue of Orestes. As I danced these delirious rondos, I felt their willing hands in mine; the pull and swing of their little bodies as the rondos grew faster and madder" (ML, 103). That reviewers recognize Duncan's effort to multiply her body is evident in Van Vechten's description of a New York audience's enthusiastic response to a 1916 performance of the <i>Marseillaise</i> (Rouget de Lisle). He applauds Duncan's ability: without making a sound to invoke "the hideous din of a hundred raucous voices." According to Van Vechten, this is accomplished through the interactions of various body parts. At "times, legs, arms, a leg or an arm, the throat, or the exposed breast assume an importance above that of the rest of the mass, suggesting the unfinished sculpture of Michael Angelo [<i>sic</i>] . . . " (TNI, 31). By creating oppositional relationships in her body, Duncan's single form represents the "unfinished" 

<b></b>

potential of the masses. Van Vechten mentions Michelangelo, but Duncan actually incorporates poses directly from Rude's sculpture of <i>Marseillaise</i> on the <i>Arc de Triomphe</i> and other postures suggestive of Marianne, the French symbol of war. Although Van Vechten carefully buries Duncan's "exposed breast" in a catalogue of other body parts, her famous and controversial final pose was an evocation of Delacroix's <i>Liberty Leading the People</i>, which would also remind an American audience of the Statue of Liberty and the historical friendship with France. The partially realized living picture of Delacroix's <i>Liberty</i> invites the audience to join the battle and fill in for the missing res, the mass of soldiers following Marianne. In a letter to Gertrude Stein<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  after a 1917 New York concert including <i>Marseillaise</i> and a final speech for the Allied cause, Van Vechten claims, "I tell you she drives 'em mad; the recruiting stations are full of her converts" (IASL, 365).
</p>

<p>
Like Saint-Point, Duncan's <i>Marseillaise</i> celebrates war, and while she does not dance as the machine in the manner of Censi, Duncan's motor in the soul quote reveals her insistence upon the soul's materiality. In fact, she designates the physical region of the solar plexus as "the temporal home of the soul" (ML, 244) in the account that has become the "foundational narrative of modern dance, its myth of origin."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

I spent long days and nights in the studio seeking that dance which might be the divine expression of the human spirit through the medium of the body's movement. For hours I would stand quite still, my two hands folded between my breasts, covering the solar plexus . . . I was seeking, and finally discovered, the central spring of all movement, the crater of motor power. . . . The ballet school taught the pupils that this spring was found in the centre of the back at the base of the spine. From this axis says the ballet master, arms legs, and trunk must move freely, giving the result of an articulated puppet. This method produces artificial mechanical movement not worthy of the soul.

<p class="noIndent">
Situated in the center of the body, just above the abdomen, the solar plexus is engaged whenever the body travels in space rather than gestures with appendages like a puppet. Duncan locates the "human spirit" and the source of "divine expression" as well as the soul in the solar plexus and then defines her dance as movement from this locus. Thus, dance is a bodily response to a "central spring" or "motor power" that reveals the stirrings of a physicalized soul and provides a visible sign of inner spirituality. She rejects ballet's virtuosic kicks and codified gestures, which she associates with "mechanical movement," in favor of the technological and spiritual advance represented by fluid, motorized motion.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's designation of the solar plexus as the physical location of the soul and the motor propelling dance, according to Hillel Schwartz, establishes the trend of twentieth-century motion.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The solar plexus assumed a politico-anatomical place as "centre of action and sympathy" early in the nineteenth century, and its centrality was further strengthened by the neurophysiological experiments of David Ferrier (1876, 1886). Schwartz describes the "new kinaesthetic" as "torque," the "model of motion as a spiral at whose radiant center was a mystical solar plexus"  or a "spiraling outward from a soulful center" (T, 108). The movement concept of "torque" was popularized 

<b></b>

by Duncan and then made its way into nearly every movement experience of the century, from the embodied motions of handwriting to the external propulsion of the escalator. Schwartz's argument opposes the current wisdom that modern industrialized life with its "assembly lines, time clocks...flashbulb photography, silent films, ragtime music and Cubism" fostered experiences of isolated, punctuated moments and fragmentation (T, 105). Schwartz maintains that the new kinaesthetic's flowing, spiraling motion is not simply a movement ideal opposing the dominant experience of motion during the period, because people have not begun to move like machines (T, 108). Duncan's image of the motor in the solar plexus/soul, however, suggests that the movement ideal she popularized for modernism actually integrated elements of industrialized motion to imagine qualities of movement, like a multiplied body, that only a motor could produce.
</p>

<p>
Another quality of motorized movement emphasized by Duncan is the illusion that an exterior force propels the body the way a motor propels a vehicle. Duncan describes placing a motor in her soul before she goes on stage and claims that after this agentive act, "my legs and arms and my whole body will move independently of my will" (ML, 123). The motor thus becomes the <i>will</i> of the soul, a complicated concept that Duncan derives from her study of Nietzsche.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  She adapts ideas about will into movement principles that manifest themselves in two different, even contradictory, qualities in her pieces: an effortless spontaneity and a willful display of the labor to move. These qualities correspond to opposing muscular experiences described in Nietzsche's theory of the will; using the language of movement, he suggests that in "every act of willing" there is a muscular sensation, even if we do not move, due to "a sort of habit."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  This sensation includes the "feeling of the state <i>away from which</i>, the feeling of the state <i>towards which</i>," a "commandeering thought," and the "affect of the command" (BGE, 18-ss19). Thus, the process of willing creates a duality whereby the individual is both "the one who commands <i>and</i> the one who obeys," simultaneously experiencing the sensations of the commander's power and freedom and the subordinate's "compulsion, force, pressure, resistance, and motion." Nietzsche ultimately relates the will to the soul by defining the body as "a society constructed out of many souls" (19-ss19). This many-souled, social body resembles the motor's <i>multiplied body</i>, and in pieces such as <i>Marseillaise</i>, Duncan represents both aspects of the Nietzschean will: the power of the commanding force and the restriction of obedience.
</p>

<p>
In "The Dance of the Future," the expanded version of her address to the Berlin Press Club, Duncan repeats Nietzsche's idea that the willing individual both commands and obeys, and applies this to her dance.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Demonstrating again the conjuncture of discourses that characterizes her writing, Duncan defines will as "the movement of the universe concentrating in an individual" and dance as "the natural gravitation of this will of the individual" (TDF, 55). As an instance of cosmic force, the "individual" discovers "natural" dance movements when she is in "harmony" with the gravitational movements of the earth. For Duncan, the dancer's will submits to these forces and allows them to move her, just as she places a motor in her soul to propel her. That is, her "natural" dance should appear spontaneous and unchoreographed, like the "movement

<b></b>

of free animals and birds." Duncan argues, "It is only when you put free animals under false restrictions that they lose the power of moving in harmony with nature, and adopt a movement expressive of the restrictions placed upon them" (TDF, 54&#x02013;55). The human will also asserts itself in unnatural contortions when restrictions hinder its movements; thus pieces exploring oppression, like <i>Marseillaise</i>,depict the muscular effort of the will to rise against tyranny.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's idea of the motor as the will of the soul and Nietzsche's theories of the will's two muscular manifestations (the natural, harmonic and the restricted, oppressed motions) become primary choreographic principles for Duncan. If she hopes to create the impression that dance is the "natural" expression of a soulful inner self, she must not appear to be dancing choreographed steps, and she works for an illusion of spontaneity, the feeling that a motor is propelling her body. Reviewers often misunderstand this technique and suggest that Duncan is a "solo artist who gave little thought to choreography as such."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The prevailing theories of Duncan's choreographic process continue to be that her dance is an improvisation of emotional self-expression or music visualization.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The argument hinges on the ultimately inconclusive discussion of whether personal experience, music, or narrative is the initial inspiration for the choreography.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Emotion, self, and music are all important sources of choreographic ideas, and she associated each with her image of the motor. In "Depth," she writes, "Emotion works like a motor. It must be warmed up to run well, and the heat does not develop immediately; it is progressive." Moreover, the running of this emotional motor allows us to "lose ourselves in an inner self."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> A careful choreographer, Duncan's analogy of motorized propulsion helps her achieve a desired effect, a trance-like, spontaneous performance.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's achievement of the illusion of spontaneity influenced Stanislavski's innovations in acting theory and dramatic performance, as did one more quality of her motorized movement: repetition. Significantly, Duncan's passage in her autobiography on the motor in the soul quotes from Stanislavski's chapter devoted to her and Gordon Craig in his own autobiography . Stanislavski describes the first time he saw Duncan dance in 1905 and the close friendship they developed when she returned to Moscow in 1908, and he discusses her influence on his ideas of performance using the trope of the motor in the soul:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
At the time I was in search of that very creative motor, which the actor must learn to put in his soul before he comes out on stage. . . . . I watched her during her performances and her rehearsals, when her developing emotion would first change the expression of her face, and with shining eyes she would pass to the display of what was born in her soul.

<p class="noIndent">
Stanislavski hopes to replicate Duncan's effect of motorized movement, the appearance that an exterior force propels the performer through an emotional experience that results in a "display" of the "soul." Duncan's impact on Stanislavski has not been recognized in dance and theater history.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In fact, Joseph R. Roach's <i>The Player's Passion</i>, a fascinating study of the history of acting theory in relation to science and

<b></b>

prevailing understandings of the human body, fails to mention Duncan among the lines of influence from Diderot to Craig and Stanislavski.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Nonetheless, Stanislavski's theories and Roach's discussion of his "System" reveal points of connection with Duncan. According to Roach, Stanislavski sought to "objectify the phenomenon of spontaneity" by defining spontaneity in performance as "an activity repeated so often that it becomes automatic and therefore free" (TPP, 197). In Stanislavski's rubric, "Habit creates second nature, which is a second reality."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The repetitive rehearsal process fosters habits and a "second nature," which emerges on the stage as an "unconscious" or "natural" response that then enables the actor to recreate lived experience on the stage as a "second reality."
</p>

<p>
Stanislavski's mention of Duncan's rehearsal process in his autobiography, in addition to their shared interest in the motor as an image of repetition, would suggest that she too seeks to "objectify" spontaneity through habit formation. In an interview with Mason Redfern (ca. 1917), she insists, "When I am dancing, the movements succeed one another so rapidly, so spontaneously, it would seem&#x02014;though every effect is carefully worked out beforehand&#x02014;that I hardly know what I am doing and my state of mind is akin to clairvoyance."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Before each performance, Duncan clearly choreographs in the traditional sense, "carefully" organizes the effect she hopes to produce, establishes movement patterns, and rehearses until she no longer needs to think about each individual step and the dance becomes habit. The modernist concept of habit, as Lisi Schoenbach has recently demonstrated, is more significant than has been recognized by critics reading modernism through the lens of avant-garde principles of shock. Defining a "pragmatic modernism," a version of modernism founded on the tradition of American pragmatism, Schoenbach discusses John Dewey's view of habit as both a force for "machine-like repetition" and a necessity for any process of social reorganization.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  For Dewey, a society without habit is in chaos and the dominance of habit can produce blind recurrence, but "with conflict of habits and release of impulse there is conscious search" (PE, 242). Duncan and Stanislavski translate this view of habit to the stage and use the repetition of rehearsal to form habits that will alter the usual consciousness of performance and allow for a state of "creative unconscious" or "clairvoyance." The habits developed for performances will likely conflict with other, more quotidian habits to release Dewey's "impulse" for "conscious search."
</p>

<p>
For Duncan, only the disciplined, rehearsed, moving body can produce a trance-like state and the experience of an unconscious performance. While Stanislavski is interested in spontaneous speech and other modes of drama in addition to movement, his psychophysical techniques suggest that bodily movement is an important aspect of his training as well. Stanislavski writes that both physical and psychological or "inner" habits are used on stage as the actor develops "creative objectives" that "lure" emotions and desires: "All these necessary objectives are so habitual that we execute them mechanically, with our muscles. In our inner realm, too, we find an infinite number of necessary, simply psychological objectives" (TCT, 255&#x02013;256). Stanislavski theorizes the relationship between the performing mind and body using the scientific and psychological advancements of the early twentieth century, just as Duncan adopts evolutionary 

<b></b>

theory and the physics of gravitation to explain her ideas of will and spontaneity. Like Duncan, Stanislavski theorizes the "soul" into this relationship, insisting, "The bond between body and soul is indivisible . . . In every physical act there is a psychological element and a physical one in every psychological act" (TPP, 205). Although interpreters of Stanislavski's System and American Method acting outline a purely materialistic and mechanistic performance theory, "a bald equation of organism and machine" (TPP, 217), Stanislavski uses phrases such as "spiritual activity," "inner aspiration," and "inner calls to action" (TCT, 253&#x02013;254). In fact, Stanislavski, like Duncan, hoped to create a "religion of art" with theater as a temple, audience as worshippers, and actors as initiates at the ritual. As Roach explains, "A mystic and idealist, he tolerated his own mechanization of the art he loved only within definite limits, and such sonorities as the 'inner life of the human spirit' rolled off his tongue far more naturally than technical terms like <i>cerebral reflex</i>" (TPP, 217). The metaphysical language of Stanislavski, Duncan, even futurist manifestos, and Nietzsche's philosophy, suggests that invocations of spirit and soul are more prevalent in various spheres of modernism than critics often recognize.
</p>

<p>
Both Duncan's image of the motor in the soul and her desire to create the illusion of spontaneity shape her choreography and rehearsal methods, which have been passed down to contemporary Duncan dancers studying at the Isadora Duncan Dance Foundation (IDDF). In addition to frequent rehearsals to render the movements so familiar that performers need not think about separate motions (dancers call this muscle memory), Duncan technique as taught by IDDF requires that the execution of movements be a fraction of a count behind the music (CS). Thus, the dance appears to be a response or reaction to the music, and the dancer can produce the illusion that the movement is not choreographed. Duncan dancers also train themselves to produce this spontaneous quality in their dance by practicing improvisational exercises at the conclusion of each IDDF class. Duncan technique further stipulates that a thought or intention motivates every movement; describing her teaching philosophy, Duncan claims, "We do not allow the child to make a single movement unless it knows why it makes it."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Prior to every gesture, the dancer must convey a desire and decision to make the motion so that she appears to be moving in response to an instantaneous impulse rather than following the choreography of a previous desire. In <i>Water Study</i>, the Chopin Waltz discussed above, the face registers excitement at the thought of a new "game" when the dancer decides to emerge and chase a water bird. In addition to facial expression, the qualities of the physical movement can also indicate intention. In Duncan technique, every motion must begin from the solar plexus, unfold from this center, and involve the entire body. To perform correctly a reaching gesture, the solar plexus initiates a vector by shifting the torso in the direction of the reach, the upper arm continues the motion as if the force were traveling progressively from shoulder to hand, and the fingertips finish the gesture by pointing to the shape it would make in the air. Duncan contrasts the continuity of motorized motion with ballet technique's end-stopped feats of physical virtuosity: "The expression of the modern school of ballet, wherein each action is an end, and no movement, pose or rhythm is successive or can be made to evolve succeeding action, is an expression of degeneration, of living death" (TDF, 56). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The requirement that an intention or thought precede each gesture might appear to contradict the state of "clairvoyance" Duncan describes or her claim that the motor works without the intervention of her will. Crucially, the spontaneous performance she desires is notthoughtless, although it seems not to have been thought prior to the performance, just as Stanislavski's actor does not appear to have previously chosen a response. Nor is Duncan dance effortless. Returning to Duncan's Nietzschean definition of the will as an instance of gravitational motion, it is clear that even when movement is propelled by a motor, the forces of gravity still operate on the body as the weight shifts and a leg lifts or an arm reaches. In fact, Duncan technique requires recognition of the weight of gravity in every motion, a very difficult effect for dancers to produce, especially those trained in ballet technique. Another of Duncan's critiques of the "corps de ballet" focuses on the painful, "unnatural" toe shoes that attempt "to create the delusion that the law of gravitation does not exist" (TDF, 56). Whereas the ballerina is taught to conceal the effort of her movements with a pleasant face and a rigid torso, the Duncan dancer is taught to acknowledge the effort to move the leg's weight as it responds to the force of gravity, even in Duncan's small waltz steps. Duncan rarely choreographs ballet's <i>degag&#x000E9;s</i>, kicks with a straight leg that tend to accentuate length and suggest lightness; instead, her leg swings require a bent knee. This weight is also evident in Censi's <i>Aerofuturist Dance</i>, which most prominently presents the thigh, the heaviest part of the leg, to the audience.
</p>

<p>
The literal weight of Duncan's thigh exerted pressure on the image of the <i>new woman</i> of modernism as Duncan became an internationally recognized symbol for women's liberation. Her significance for early feminism has not been fully realized, perhaps because her suspicions of mass political movements led her to disassociate herself from the suffragettes. Floyd Dell's <i>Women as World Builders</i> , a surprisingly early (and forgotten) summary of trajectories of feminism, devotes a chapter to Duncan. According to Dell, the American movement, following her lead, was more concerned with liberating the body than agitating for the vote.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  He argues, "[I]t is to the body that one looks for the Magna Charta [<i>sic</i>.] of feminism," and Duncan "renovated the modern soul and made us see . . . the goodness of the whole body" (WWB, 45&#x02013;49). For Dell, as for the other prominent res in this study, modern life requires the renovation of the soul and body rather than a complete rupture from spiritual modes of life. Duncan's 1915 American tour introduced her to Dell and other members of New York's "Young Intellectuals," a group of artists and revolutionaries centered in Greenwich Village. Dell, Max Eastman, and John Sloan were members of the collective editorship of <i>The Masses</i>, a radical publication structured as "a worker-owned cooperative with all stock held by the artists and writers."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  In addition to its revolutionary politics and advocacy of artistic freedom, <i>The Masses</i> was instrumental in developing the image of the <i>new woman</i> in drawings and articles that supported economic equality and suffrage (TMM, 191). Duncan's expressive, free (uncorseted) body, dancing alone onstage, became the prototype for this image of the modern woman.
</p>

<p>
The May 1915 edition of <i>The Masses</i> features a cover designed by Sloan, a leading artist of the Ashcan school, illustrating the preparation for a leg extension in Duncan's 

<b></b>

<i>Marche Militaire</i>.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The September 1917 edition includes one of the many famous Duncan drawings by Abraham Walkowitz, and both Walkowitz and Sloan depict a shapely, full-breasted woman dancing alone in an empty space without scenery to distract the eye from the singular body. With thickly shaded lines, they emphasize the weightiness of the thighs that are a trademark of the Duncan technique. Sloan's sketch of <i>Marche Militaire</i> is particularly suggestive of the lightness of the lower leg falling from the bent knee in opposition to the heaviness of a thigh. Duncan's thigh appears to have been pulled upward toward the chest rather than lifted away from the body, as ballet technique would prescribe. Sloan saw Duncan perform several times and describes her as, "Not angelic, materialistic-not superhuman but the greatest human love of life. Her great big thighs, her small head, her full solid loins, belly-clean, all clean&#x02014;holy&#x02014;part of God."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  This might be a list of the qualities he was attempting to capture in his 1911 painting "Isadora Duncan" (begun March 3, repainted March 8). In this image, too, Duncan is dancing alone and the positions of the legs again emphasize their weight; she stands on one slightly bent leg, lifting the other as if to present her thigh to the audience. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>)
</p>

<p>
Duncan's thigh and mature, womanly body, dressed in flowing tunics with free breasts, captured in an arrested moment of movement, served as the paradigmatic image of the self-sufficient, emancipated woman. Sloan's description of Duncan as "not angelic, materialistic" and yet a "part of God" reveals that audiences saw both the political weight of her performance and the soulful, clairvoyant aspect. The influence of Duncan's singular body on Sloan's other drawings of women is evident in the same thick lines and full thighs. The significance of these depictions of the womanly body lies in their deviation from the image of the sleek and stiffly posed "commercial cover girl" that, to the artists of <i>The Masses</i>, "represented the forces of capitalism because it used art&#x02014;and by implication sex&#x02014;to sell a magazine filled with illustrated advertisements designed to sell goods" (TMM, 203).<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  In response to a letter complaining of "crude" drawings, Eastman writes that <i>The Masses</i> offers alternatives to the "slippery girls in tights and tinted cupids" featured in conventional magazines (TMM, 206). Eastman echoes Duncan's own chastisement of ballet and vaudeville dancers in "horrid salmon-coloured silk tights" (ML, 115) with their "half-clothed suggestiveness" and "burlesque semi-exposures" (IS, 48&#x02013;49). The extent to which Duncan changed conceptions of the female body is also revealed by a comparison of images from early and late in her career. A series of drawings, signed "Aspell," from a New York recital in 1898, depicts Duncan as a slight, nymph-like re wearing toe shoes with ribbons. (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) Aspell presents her in the genre of nineteenth-century ballet, but a decade later, when Walkowitz and Sloan begin drawing Duncan's weighty thighs, her body had changed, but more importantly, she changed the way the dancing body and the female body more generally could be represented.
</p>

Dance criticism and modernist studies alike have failed to recognize the extent of Duncan's participation in international modernism and influence on several of its more significant movements in addition to modern dance: futurism, the Moscow Art Theatre, Greenwich Village radicalism, and feminism.

soul resembles Victorian spiritualism, Duncan assigns the soul a physiological location and reveals a modern suspicion of its immanence. The word "soul" functions as a placeholder for all that is outside rational logic and "verbal teaching" in her 1924 Speech at the Kamerny Theater (IS, 81&#x02013;84). Duncan claims that children learn not through words but "through movements; up to the age of ten or twelve they learn more from the soul. But nobody believes in the soul any more, so I say they learn from the spirit, or from intuitions" (IS, 82). Duncan advocates romantic principles of education, but recognizes the necessity of changing her terminology for modern life. If her audience no longer understands "soul," she finds another word that marks the same sphere of human experience. In this late speech, Duncan argues against continuing accusations that she is "mystical." Instead, she advocates the "natural" dance of the soul, which she explains with images of unfolding plants and flowers but also with the motor: "&#x02026;here in our breast is a motor supplying power for our most wonderful emotions" (IS, 82).
</p>

<p>
Duncan employs the language of technology as a dialectic to ways of being (the motorized machine rather than the mechanical puppet), and her motor in the soul suggests the renovation of the spiritual through images of modern industrial technology. Duncan's conjunction of scientific, evolutionary, and metaphysical discourse in her speeches and published writing is actually a central modernist trope that can be found among futurists, philosophers, and feminists alike. Just as Duncan refuses to establish an opposition between the soulful human and the mechanized motor, she combines, dissolves, and dances around many of modernism's fundamental dualisms without resolving them: spirit/body, sacred/profane, self/society. Unlike other early modernists, she choreographs these ideas and contradictions into dances seeming so fluid and continuous that they appear to be the spontaneous movements of a body propelled by a motor, so weighted that her thighs become symbols of political struggle.

As her two children were also killed in an automobile, it is tempting to read the tragedies of Duncan's life as comments on the invasion of the motor.

Gertrude Stein's <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> (New York: Vintage, 1990) reveals, "Raymond Duncan, the brother of Isadora, rented an atelier in the Rue de Fleurus" . Treating family intrigue with her wry humor, she writes, "Raymond had gone completely greek and this included a greek girl. Isadora lost interest in him, she found the girl too modern a greek" . Even if Duncan was avoiding her brother (her autobiography indicates that she accepted his marriage), the link suggests that her dance may have influenced Picasso, Matisse, and other artists of the Stein circle. Stein's writing also invokes the aesthetics of the motor; in <i>Lectures in America</i> (London: Virago, 1988) she attempts to give her words constant motion through the rhythms of repetition: "It is something strictly American to conceive a space that is filled with moving, a space of time that is filled always filled with moving" .

Nietzche introduces his concept of the will in <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> (1883&#x02013;1885) but explores it more thoroughly in <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> ed. Rolf-Peter Horstmann and Judith Norman (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2002), 18-ss19. Henceforth abbreviated as BGE.

Duncan, "The Dance of the Future" in <i>Art of the Dance</i>, ed. Sheldon Cheney (New York: Theatre Arts, 1969), 54. Henceforth abbreviated as TDF. Duncan's rhetoric throughout this essay echoes Nietzche. In a closing invocation, she writes, "Oh, she is coming, the dancer of the future: the free spirit, who will inhabit the body of new woman . . . .the highest intelligence in the freest body" . Her phrase, "dancer of the future" may be inspired by Nietzsche's "philosophers of the future," whom he describes as "free, <i>very</i> free spirits" (BGE, 40-ss44).

Contemporaneous reviews frequently designate Duncan's performances as self-expressive, and her influential student, Irma Duncan describes the dance of her teacher as a "personal expression" and an "individual manifestation that cannot be duplicated." Irma Duncan, <i>The Technique of Isadora Duncan</i> (New York: Dance Horizons, 1970), xi. The notion that Duncan's choreography is a practice of music visualization still receives credence; after viewing reconstructions of Duncan's choreography during the Duncan centennial celebration, Robert J. Pierce describes her choreography as "slavish to the beat and much too literal" (<i>Soho Weekly</i>, 9 June 1977, IDDA).

Ann Daly discusses the debate and argues, "Duncan's dancing was not the spontaneous expression of her own personal emotions. Neither was it the description of music . . . Rather, music

served as her starting point suggesting to Duncan visual/emotional imagery" (DID, 137&#x02013;39). It is also possible, however, that Duncan initially became interested in the visual/emotional imagery of a story, like the myth of Iphigenia, and then chose a piece of music from Gluck's opera, <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> as accompaniment. Moreover, Duncan occasionally choreographed pieces, such as <i>Death and the Maiden</i> , without musical accompaniment (IASL, 248).

Several dance articles give general and inaccurate overviews of Duncan in relation to the theater. David Weiss mentions Duncan's influence on Method acting, but minimizes the contributions of both Duncan and Craig, describing them as "pioneers in theatrical self-expression." "Isadora Duncan...Actress: And Her Influence on the Theater," <i>Dance Magazine</i> (Feb. 1960): 40&#x02013;43. N. Roslavleva uses the motor in the soul quote to differentiate Duncan's practice from Stanislavski's interest in the development of character: "Duncan started that motor within herself for the purpose of self-expression . . . She expressed emotions of a general kind, never showing any interest in characterization, never being anyone but herself." Roslavleva, "Stanislavski and the ballet," <i>Dance Perspectives</i> (23.15): 16. As her dance as the daughters of Danai reveals, Duncan invoked several characters and chose crucial scenes to represent. A spectrum of variations complicates the distinction between performing as self and as another character, and Duncan explored many of these options. Even in Method acting, the technique of emotional recall suggests that the actor remembers past emotional experiences and uses them to inspire the performance.
