In public Benito Mussolini seldom acknowledged his debts to the cultural
movements that had contributed to fascism's formation. In private,
however, he was often quite explicit in issuing generous certificates
of recognition, especially to the avant-gardes of the early twentieth
century, chief among them the Futurist movement and the group that been
centered around the journal <I>La Voce</I>. His encounter with <I>La
Voce</I>, Mussolini confided to his preferred biographer, had been
a revelation for him, giving him the certainty that he was a man of
destiny, someone "called upon to announce a new age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 And with equal generosity <I>il duce</I> spoke of his debts to Futurism:
 "I formally declare that without Futurism there would never have been
 a fascist revolution."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even apart from Mussolini's statements, which are hardly negligible
in their own right, it is difficult to deny the participation of the
avant-garde in the formation of fascist political culture. Collaborators
and important readers of <I>La Voce</I> became fascist militants; the
principal exponents of Futurism were among the founding fathers of the
fascist movement and firmly adhered to the totalitarian regime, actively
collaborating in the creation of its culture and the diffusion of its
ideology; and some, such as Marinetti and Sironi, remained faithful to
Mussolini and fascism into the years of the Republic of Sal&ograve;. Yet
the overt participation of avant-garde culture in the generation and
the fortunes of fascism has never sufficed to prevent the rise of a
lively debate, begun already in the early 1920s, about the nature of
their relation, especially in the case of Futurism. In 1923 Giuseppe
Pressolini, for example, denied

<B></B>

that there was any ideal connection between Futurism and fascism
as it had come to be in power, for Futurism was antitraditionalist,
individualist, libertarian, antimoralist, and anti-Catholic, while
fascism was classicist, hierarchic, authoritarian, moralist, and Catholic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Benedetto Croce, however, writing in 1924, urged the opposite view:
 "To anyone with a sense of historical connections, the ideal origins
 of fascism are to be found in Futurism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 And in support of his claim the philosopher listed the Futurist matrices
 of fascism: the cult of action, the disposition toward violence, the
 intolerance of dissent, desire for the new, disdain for culture and
 tradition, and the glorification of youth. Ironically, both Croce and
 Prezzolini may have been right, and, at the same time, wrong. The same
 might be said for many others who have continued to discuss this question
 in more or less the same way, sometimes accentuating the points of
 convergence or consensus between the two movements, sometimes emphasizing
 their moments of discrepancy or disagreement. Either interpretation can
 seem valid if one proceeds, as did Croce and Prezzolini, by isolating
 a single aspect or a particular moment in the relations between the
 two movements and using that as a basis for generalization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Analysis of the relations between fascism and Futurism, however, cannot be
limited to collating their doctrinal agreements or to registering, in a
sort of parallel history, their record of coalition and conflict. Though
certainly useful, ultimately such a procedure proves critically sterile,
for in practice it merely leads to the reaffirmation of what was already
self-evident to the historical protagonists themselves. We know, after
all, that Futurism was not identical with fascism on the historical,
cultural, or political levels: any such identification was repeatedly
contested by futurists who were neither fascists nor antifascists, and
it conflicts with the variety of contradictory political ideologies
that were lodged within Futurism both before and after the arrival of
fascism in power, contradictions that neither prered nor were ever
resolved within the ideology of fascism. But this recognition does not
imply that one can sustain the view, urged by apologists of Futurism
committed to minimizing its involvement in fascism, that the culture
of Futurism was of a kind that differed fundamentally in its values and
its myths from fascist political culture. Nor can the collaboration of
Futurism and fascism be dismissed with the reductive thesis that Futurist
participation in fascism was merely a matter of personal inclination,
an historical problem of secondary importance, one to be explained by
individual opportunism or ingenuity. For at the origins of that thesis
is a presupposition informing debate about the larger problem of the
relations between fascism and culture, and especially the problem of
fascism's attitude toward modernity and the role of modernist culture in
totalitarian politics. Fascism, it was long assumed, possessed neither
an ideology nor a culture of its own; it was, instead, a reactionary
movement that was fundamentally antimodern, that looked nostalgically to
the past and that sought to arrest the process of modernity in order to
stop or turn back the movement of modernity. The modernist avant-gardes,
it was likewise assumed, differed absolutely in their very essence from
the politics of totalitarianism, and on the basis of these assumptions
one could explain the widespread participation of important res of

<B></B>

Italian culture and the modernist avant-garde in both the movement and
the regime of fascism solely by motives of self-interest or political
naivet&eacute;. Avant-garde intellectuals who became fascists, it
was often insisted, did so on the basis of a profound misapprehension
of what fascism really was. Yet while personal interest or political
misunderstanding can hardly be excluded from among the motivations that
informed Futurist participation in fascism, an account formulated in more
properly historical terms would need to address other and more important
facts: that the encounter between Futurism and fascism occurred in the
period of fascism's formation, when nobody would have bet a penny on
its success; and that the Futurists' participation in fascism when in
power took place with a full awareness of what fascism was, and that the
Futurists, though disagreeing with some decisions and some orientations
of the regime, never suggested that its totalitarian politics was in
conflict with their conception of culture, with their idea of modernity,
or with their vision of the destiny of the nation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More recently, study of the relations between fascism and culture
has entered a new stage, one that permits us to examine the cultural,
ideological, and political relations between Futurism and fascism from
a new perspective.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Few scholars now find a fundamental incompatibility between the terms
 fascism and culture, or fascism and modernity; and whereas twenty years
 ago it was considered almost blasphemy, at least within the field of
 Italian historiography, to define fascism as essentially modern, today
 it has become common to speak of fascism as an "alternative modernism,"
 or to use terms such as "modernist fascism" or "fascist modernism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Studies in this direction have been fruitful and innovative, and
 increasingly studies of fascist culture have given greater attention
 to fascism's attitude toward modernity--a theme fun-damental
 to understanding the very nature of fascism--even if not always
 with methods or results that appear wholly convincing in relation
 to the history of the relations between culture and politics in
 fascism. "Fascist modernism" has been especially studied by literary
 critics and historians of art, sometimes with notable results, often
 drawing upon the interpretation of fascism as "the aestheticization of
 politics" which Benjamin proposed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Yet however suggestive this interpretation, it can also be misleading
 if it obscures fascism's other important feature, its "politicization
 of aesthetics," which not only inspired fascism's attitude toward
 avant-garde culture, but stood at the very origin of the encounter
 between Futurism and fascism and of the participation of many modernist
 intellectuals in fascism. Such caution might seem obvious, but it is also
 necessary if we are to avoid letting emphasis on "the aestheticization
 of politics" lead to a kind of "aestheticization" of fascism itself,
 privileging only its literary, aesthetic, and symbolic aspects while
 losing sight of motivations and matrices that are essentially political
 in nature. To do so risks trivializing the fundamentally political nature
 of fascism, its culture, its ideology, and its symbolic universe. Even
 when studying strictly aesthetic manifestations of fascism, such as its
 political style, its liturgy for the masses, or its copious symbolic
 production, all of them characteristic and essential elements in the
 fascist mode of doing politics, it is important not to lose sight of
 the political dimension of fascist culture. This does not

<B></B>

mean that one should not underestimate the problem of "the
aestheticization of politics," as I have argued for some time in urging
that fascism's "politics of the spectacle" was the manifestation of a new
"aesthetic conception of political life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Nevertheless, the aesthetic dimension cannot be analyzed separately
 from the totalitarian conception of politics, for it was a consequence
 of that very conception. The symbolic production of fascism was not an
 outcome of its ideological incoherence,
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 but the consequential expression of a vision of life and politics
 specific to a political movement that was simultaneously a new secular
 religion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Seen from this viewpoint, "the aestheticization of politics" acquires
 particular significance insofar as it is a manifestation of the
 <I>sacralization of politics</I> that fascism undertook, a project
 pursued with the full consensus and active participation of modernist
 intellectuals and artists, who collaborated enthusiastically in
 the construction of the symbolic universe of fascist religion. That
 project, the search for a new form of secular or lay religion for
 modern Italy, was in turn an important aspect of various attempts
 to fashion a synthesis between nationalism and modernity which were
 pursued by the avant-gardes in early twentieth century Italy; and it
 was in the course of that search that most of the Futurists adhered
 to fascism from the beginning, viewing it as first a movement, then a
 regime that was capable of realizing that synthesis by instituting a
 political religion of the nation and creating an "Italian modernity"
 that would also be a model for a new European civilization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Futurist involvement in totalitarian politics, beyond any record of
discrepancies and conflicts, originated within fundamental cultural
connections that can be better identified if we situate the problem of
Futurism's relationship to fascism within the more ample perspective of
the problem of the relations between the modernist avant-garde and the
cultural origins of fascism. The most important connection concerned
attitudes toward "the experience of modernity" as that was perceived,
experienced, and interpreted by avant-garde culture and fascism. I will
consider only the political side of modernist culture, <I>modernism</I>
understood here as a vision of modernity, rather than a sociological
understanding of <I>modernization</I>, even though modernization processes
(industrialization, scientific discoveries, technologicasl development,
urbanization, mass society, globalization of capital, unification
of the world) furnish the scenario that stands in the background of
our analysis. By <I>political modernism</I>--using the definition of
modernism proposed by Marshall Berman--I mean those political ideologies
that arose in connection with modernization, ideologies that seek to
render human beings capable of mastering the processes of modernization
in order not to be overwhelmed by the "vortex of modernity," giving them
"the power to change the world that is changing them, to make their own
way within the vortex and to make it their own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Futurism and fascism are both, in this sense, manifestations of political
 modernism that belong to a common cultural terrain. The "conquest of
 modernity," as we may call the aspiration to have the capacity and the
 power to master the processes of modernization, did not follow a single
 path. Political antagonism among the ideal alternatives of modernity has
 been perhaps one the most disquieting, ambiguous, and tragic features
 of the twentieth century, Many,

<B></B>

and not just the Futurists, have believed that the surest and most
rapid path toward the "conquest of modernity" was that proposed by
totalitarian movements. Perhaps we can better understand some of the
motives for their choice by examining the Futurists.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fascism, as one scholar has perceptively remarked, represented the
"politicization of Italian modernism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Yet in reality, that politicization was already well under way long
 before the appearance of the fascist political movement, having been
 initiated by the cultural avant-garde. The affirmation of a cultural
 militancy that could wield political influence or engage in political
 action was shared across the spectrum of Italian avant-gardes at the
 beginning of the twentieth century. Prior to World War I these movements
 gave birth to a generational revolt, conducted under the banner of the
 creative role assigned to youth, that involved a radical contestation of
 parliamentary government, one in which divergent visions of modernity,
 even though posed as alternatives to one another, were aligned in a
 common front against rationalist, liberal, and bourgeois modernity. The
 laboratory of the modernist avant-gardes proposed a series of themes
 and myths of a new political and artistic culture, motifs that flowed
 together into fascism after the Great War and contributed to its
 political culture and its attitude toward modernity. This does not
 mean, however, that these movements can be defined as protofascist,
 for from the same terrain of Italian modernist culture in the early
 twentieth century there also developed other syntheses of the same
 motifs, different cultural and political movements opposed to fascism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The avant-garde cultural movements that arose in Italy at the beginning
of the twentieth century, such as Futurism and the groups that coalesced
around the reviews <I>Leonardo</I> and <I>La Voce</I>, shared a common
note of political nationalism which manifested itself in what I have
elsewhere called "the myth of Italianism," a conviction that Italy
was destined to have a role as a great protagonist and exercise a
civilizing mission in the life of the twentieth century. Toward that
end, all these movements believed in the necessity of a radical process
of moral, cultural, and political regeneration meant to give birth to
a "new Italian." Long before the birth of fascism, Futurism urged the
necessity of overcoming the barriers between culture and politics by
means of a symbiosis between culture and life, a symbiosis designed to
reawaken the intellectual and moral energies of the Italians, to endow
them with a new sense of Italianness and spur them to the conquest
of new preeminences. Artists and intellectuals were to abandon the
privileged isles of aristocratic individualism and immerse themselves
in the impetuous flux of modern life in order to become the artificers,
the spiritual guides of the New Italy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The cultural roots of Futurism and fascism intersect in the common
terrain of "modernist nationalism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The term, which I have used elsewhere, does not refer to a specific
 political or cultural movement, but defines a state of mind, a
 sensibility, a

<B></B>

cultural orientation centered on the myth of the nation, a sensibility
that we can find in all the avant-garde movements formed in Italy during
the fifteen-year period prior to the Great War. What characterized this
nationalism was essentially its attitude toward modernity, perceived as
a new dimension in human history, within which the nation could grow
and expand its power. Modernist nationalism was not conservative, nor
did it harbor nostalgia for a pre-industrial world, nor did it dream of
turning back the clock of history. Its principal characteristic was the
frank acceptance of modern life as an era of irreversible transformations
that were affecting society, consciousness, and human sensibility, and
that were preparing conditions for the rise of new forms of collective
life, a new civilization. Modernist nationalism welcomed modernity as an
explosion of human energies and an expansion of life without precedents
in history, an enthusiasm that was united with a tragic and activist
sense of existence--an "artificial optimism,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 to use Marinetti's words, that rejected nihilism with an exalted feeling
 of new plenitude and an affirmation of vitality in the life of those
 individuals and nations who would fling themselves into the vortex of
 modernity. For this particular kind of nationalism modernity was an
 acceleration of the rhythms of time, the invention and multiplication
 of technical means for the domination and exploitation of nature, an
 expansion of energies both human and material, an intensification of
 individual and collective life through struggle, a new sense of the
 world. In the field of politics, modernity meant a crisis of traditional
 aristocracies, an epoch of new masses and the rise of new elites,
 the predominance of collectivities over individuals, renovation of
 the State, and political and economic expansion. Modernist nationalism
 opposed neither modernization nor industrialization, processes it rather
 intended to promote and accelerate in order to furnish the nation with
 the means to compete within a global economy. Instead it wanted to master
 and discipline them to consolidate the cohesion of the nation and enable
 its participation in world politics. To modernize the nation meant not
 just giving it new instruments of economic and social development,
 but regenerating it from archaic habits born during the course of
 centuries of enslavement, furnishing it with a modern consciousness by
 means of a new culture. What distinguished this nationalism, what made
 it modernist, was its intention to reconcile intellectual culture, or
 <I>spiritualismo</I> (spiritualism)--understood here generically as the
 primacy of culture, ideas, and feelings--with mass industrial society,
 an intention that aimed at opposing and avoiding the negative effects
 brought in the wake of modernity, such as materialism, skepticism,
 hedonistic egoism, egalitarian conformism, etc.--all that modernist
 nationalism identified with the rationalist and individualistic tradition
 of the Enlightenment. Toward that end modernist nationalism argued the
 necessity of accompanying the industrial revolution and modernization
 with a "revolution of the mind" order to form the sensibility, the
 character, the conscience of a new Italian who could comprehend and
 confront the challenges of modern life, who could firmly adhere to the
 superiority of the mental forces that would assure unity and collective
 identity to the nation in the face of the development of material and
 technological forces. To accomplish this mental revolution, modernist
 nationalism appealed

<B></B>

less to reason than to the energy of feelings and emotions; it sought
to reactivate the mythopoetic faculties in order to create new and
modern myths of the nation--a secular religion of the nation--to oppose
the negative consequences and disgregatory effects of the crisis of
traditional society. But even though modernist nationalism availed
itself of the mythic use of history in order to construct new symbolic
and mythic worlds in support of its religion of the nation, it never
entertained a fetishistic cult of tradition, never engaged in a nostalgic
pursuit of an imaginary past order of harmony and perfection. Instead it
participated in the changes of modernity and projected the nation toward
the future, doing so with the tragic optimism of a will to power that
would affirm itself in struggle and conquest. The instrumental appeal to
myths of past grandeur, adopted to spur the renovation of national pride,
coexisted in modernist nationalism with new myths of future grandeurs yet
to be conquered; likewise, the glorification of the nation's preeminence
coexisted with an ambition to create values and principles appropriate to
a modern civilization deemed to be universal; and likewise, again, belief
in the primacy of intellectual culture coexisted with an exaltation of
a realism based on force. For modernist nationalism, war and violence
could be necessary instruments for the fulfillment of the conquest of
modernity, the regeneration of the nation, and the construction of a
new Italian civilization for the modern age.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The confrontation between nationalism and modernity in Italian political
culture went back to the origins of a united Italy. From the Risorgimento
on, the highest aspiration of the Italian patriots had been to raise
Italy to the level of the great modern nation-states, to form a national
consciousness that would furnish a feeling of collective identity for the
various Italian peoples who, though inhabiting the same peninsula, had
remained separated from one another by profound political, social, and
cultural differences virtually since the fall of the Roman empire. The
founding fathers of a united Italy assigned the new State the task of
liberating Italians from the habits of the "old man," of turning them
into truly "modern men," as Silvio Spaventa put it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 They conceived the conquest of modernity as a process of civilizing
 the nation under the banner of a nationalism that pursued the ideal of
 "liberty and progress." Yet this ideal was also understood differently
 in the two principal movements of the Risorgimento, the liberalism
 of Cavour and the radicalism of Mazzini. For Mazzini, the conquest of
 modernity was to occur through a political and mental revolution, with
 the creation of a Third Italy that Mazzini conceived as a democratic
 theocracy founded on the faith of a people morally united in a religion
 of the <I>patria</I> (fatherland); this would be a country that would
 rapidly take its place in the vanguard of the modern nations and usher in
 a new era of civilization. Cavour and the liberals, who actually created
 modern Italy, interpreted the conquest of modernity as the nation's
 ascent toward conditions of freedom, civic life, and social progress,
 an ascent conducted under the moderate guide of parliamentary government.

<B></B>

The contrast between these ways of interpreting modernity survived the
immediate process of unification to become a permanent and defining
feature of Italian political culture in the late nineteenth century,
becoming more salient as the nation experienced a growing state of
disillusionment and dissatisfaction, especially among younger generations
who were raised under the liberal regime. For notwithstanding the progress
achieved by Italy in the social and economic fields, the conquest of
modernity appeared an arduous undertaking for a nation-state constituted
so recently, still so uncertain in its identity and unstable in its
moral cohesion, while all the while the transformations of modernity
were increasing with an accelerating rhythm. In the closing years of the
nineteenth century Francesco de Sanctis, the chief educator of a united
Italy, entrusted a new generation with the mission of achieving a moral
and intellectual reformation that would give Italians a modern national
conscience: Italians had

Italy, at the turn of the century, was once more questioning its
destiny as a nation in an era of disturbing changes produced by
modernization. Humanity had entered a new stage of modernity; new forms
of life and civilization were rising because of the "rapid and immense
development of large industry," with its repercussions felt in every
class, every society, and every nation, changes that were shattering a
"thousand year old equilibrium of the world...not only in economics, but
in politics and morals," as the sociologist Mario Morasso wrote in 1905.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Morasso was among the most typical representatives of modernist
 nationalism and he formulated many of the myths of modernolatry that
 would be echoed in Futurism. With turgid rhetoric but clear-sighted
 realism, Morasso depicted the principal processes of the enormous
 transformation that was reshaping society in the age of imperialism. Its
 effects were felt in every sector of individual and collective
 life. Modern man was living "in a new world in which unimaginable new
 forces are unfolding...which have transformed not only the bases of
 international political life and the moral conduct of individuals, but
 the entire system of economic relations." Economic relations now had "a
 preponderant influence over other kinds of relations, over man's feelings
 and habits, over human nature, over the functions of government; they
 are creating a new politics and even a new consciousness...." Large-scale
 industry was having a

This was a 'new modernity,' and the predominant reaction to it among
Italian modernists at the beginning of the twentieth century was one
of unbridled enthusiasm for the new forms of expanding human life. The
conquest of modernity now meant assimilating those forms that produced,
as Marinetti wrote, "the complete renovation of human sensibility" and a
"massive expansion of human sensation":

Futurism glorified modern life with a Dionysian exaltation of everything
generated by modernity and its continuous explosion of energies, even its
most violent and brutal aspects. "For the first time," wrote Boccioni,
"we Futurists are giving an example of an enthusiastic human adherence
to the form of civilization that is forming itself before our eyes....We
are ecstatic in the face of modernity and feel the innovative delirium
of our epoch."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This feeling of enthusiastic adherence to modernity has often been
attributed solely to Futurism. But in reality it was shared by the
entire spectrum of avant-garde artists and intellectuals in Italy,
even by anti-Futurists, as were many of the Vocians. "To be moderns! To
comprehend within oneself the vital forms that are characteristic of out
age," proclaimed the Triestine writer Scipio Slataper in <I>La Voce</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 His exhortation might be considered the symbolic password of modernist
 nationalism. In the new cultural climate of the early twentieth century,
 compounded of modernism and nationalism, there was an almost unanimous
 effort to exhort Italy to enter the "vibrant turbine" of "the great
 mechanism of modern life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Even nationalists whose cultural formation was essentially classicist,
 such as Enrico Corradini, founder of the Italian nationalist movement,
 were obsessed with enthusiasm for the dynamism of modern life. Corradini
 lauded the

<BLOCKQUOTE>

spirit of the new life...greater and more powerful than it has

rise of self-conscious men who are equasl to the new life of the world

 Papini and Prezzolini were founders of the journal <I>Leonardo</I> and
 the extremely young promoters of the first Italian avant-garde of the
 twentieth century, as well as militants in the recently born movement of
 nationalism (see <I>MSN</I>, 81-191). The intellectuals who collaborated
 on <I>La Voce</I> were still more explicit in urging intellectuals to
 unite themselves with "Lombard industrialists, Genovese shipbuilders,
 bankers and businessmen of northern Italy," to work together for the
 "success of the fatherland in the struggle among the nations that are
 now contesting the world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Yet behind these exhortations, and behind the myth of Italianism that
 they embodied, there was also a disquieting conflict between faith
 in the innate virtues of the Italian nation, those virtues that were
 showing signs of rebirth and prompting the younger generation to wish
 to reconquer Italy's cultural primacy, and an inferiority complex that
 younger intellectuals felt when they compared Italy with the more
 advanced nations of Europe. Giovanni Amendola, the future leader of
 the anti-fascist opposition, observed in 1905 that Italy "has begun
 to take great strides and is firmly on the path to wealth, but it will
 not maintain its position if it does not simultaneously pursue the path
 of power."

 Another writer, the future leader of fascism who was then an
 internationalist socialist, hailed the new Italy he saw before him in
 1909; Italy was:

from a determination to accelerate the process of modernization in

culture. The modernization of society and its productive forces was to
produce a modernization of culture and sensibility. That could occur only
through the collective assimilation of new ideals intended to form the
conscience of a 'new Italian' and guide the nation in its 'conquest of

A Modern Religion for the "New Italian"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the years that preceded the Great War the vicissitudes of Italian
culture can be interpreted as a competition for the elaboration and
affirmation of an ideal of modernity. The principal intellectuals and
artists who gave life to the renewal of Italian culture during these
years were all engaged in this competition, which soon seepoed into the
world of politics. Each proposed an ideal of modernity that was meant to
shape the conscience of modern Italians. Giovanni Papini admitted that
his greatest ambition was to become "the spiritual guide of younger
Italy and the Italy of the future...I would like to be the spiritual
reorganizer of this very old race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Prezzolini created <I>La Voce</I> with the intention of achieving the
 moral and intellectual reformation of Italians, educating them in the
 cult of a "religion of modern man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Marinetti and the Futurists proposed themselves as the guides of a
 cultural revolution that would forge the modern Italian, liberating
 him from all devotion to the cultural heritage of the past and the myth
 of tradition. The same ambition to shape the Italian of the twentieth
 century also inspired the cultural engagement of intellectuals who were
 not part of the avant-garde but who enjoyed prestige and influence among
 the young. Benedetto Croce, with his vast work as critic, philosopher,
 and historian, assigned himself the task of  forming "a modern Italian
 conscience that would be European and national."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Giovanni Gentile, philosopher and educational theorist, dedicated his
 work to the task of reforming the character of Italians in order to
 bring to completion the national revolution of the Risorgimento, forge
 the spiritual unity of the nation, and once more conduct the Italian
 nation into the vanguard of modernity.

The idea that culture possessed a militant function, that it was
intellectual activity that formed the modern conscience of a new Italian,
was common to the different movements of the modernist avant-garde. In
common also was the conviction that to be modern meant first of all, to
say it with Croce, to possess a "culture of the whole man," which, in
the consciousness of modern man, was to take over the place left empty
by the crisis of traditional religion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Modernity, from this point of view, was understood as an epoch of crisis
 and of transition from one system of values rooted in the pre-industrial
 world to another that belonged to a new civilization whose construction

<B></B>

would have to be entrusted to modern man's capacity to know how to master
his own destiny and shape the future. As Prezzolini wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Modern man lives without the faith of the past and without any
faith in the present and often without any faith in a faith of the
future. Destined to live in a new civilization, he feels that he has
been sacrificed, yet without having any self-awareness of the cause,
which might render him great. He feels his own tragedy, yet cannot climb
high enough intellectually to turn himself into Fate and master his own
dilemma. Whence the sense of dismay, the darkness, the nihilism of so
many souls....The individual is no longer supported by those social
barriers that separated, but also sustained, that hindered him from
rising but also protected him from falling, and every day he finds
himself faced with the alternative of becoming either a master of the
world or the last rag of flesh that a blind force has seized to sweep
the streets. Something great is being born, he senses, but the immense
labor is twisting the social body with spasms of pain.

The perception of living in a crisis of civilization was fundamental in
the experience of modernity for the younger generation. "The collective

<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Mixing Marx and Nietzsche, the young revolutionary understood modernity
 above all as an age of the transmutation of values, a change that would
 lead, through socialism, to an overcoming of Christian civilization
 and the advent of a new pagan culture guided by the will to power
 "which unfolds in the creation of new values, whether moral, artistic,

The problem of constructing a new civilization, even if not always
treated explicitly, was at the center of the debate about the nature of
modernity on the part of the avant-gardes, and it shaped their search
for a new ideal of <I>total life</I>, within which the search for a
new synthesis between nationalism and modernity began to assume special
importance. Italy, affirmed Croce, "will not be spiritually great if it
will not conquer its own religious conscience, which is at the same time
a philosophical conscience."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Young avant-gardists would have had little difficulty agreeing,
 though their understanding of what the new "religious conscience"
 would be differed sharply. In effect, as Prezzolini wrote in 1912,
 all "the younger generation of Italy" felt "that a vast and serious
 movement...could not be achieved except under some total form....It
 had to have depth, ethical or metaphysical or in a certain religious
 line...the movement had to be <I>total</I>, which is to say it had
 to speak to man, to the man of today, to the Italian of today." The
 intuition that "something great was being born"

<B></B>

gave a note of messianic expectation to the search for a new total vision
of life, a note that was evident in the demand for a <I>new religion</I>,
something that the avant-garde considered indispensable for enabling
the nation to continue its pursuit of the conquest of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The search for a new secular religion was an essentially modern
phenomenon, and in no way represented a resurgent form of older
millenarianisms or eschatological visions typical of the premodern era
(see <I>NF</I>, 31). The demand sprang spontaneously, so to speak, from
the same enthusiastic experience of modernity, which, it is true, might
be assimilated to that state of "collective effervescence" that generates
religious states of mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 In part it emerged from the typically modernist demand to formulate a
 response to the 'death of God,' but in part it constituted a polemical
 attack against rationalist political ideologies, understood as the
 theoretical systems of understanding and defining the course of
 history which had dominated the political culture of the nineteenth
 century. Pragmatism, the new idealism of Croce and Gentile, the various
 philosophies of life formulated in the wake of Nietzsche, united in
 giving prestige to the experience of faith in the life of individuals and
 collectivities. To the culture of the avant-garde, modernity, far from
 having decreed the definitive decline of religion before the radiant
 triumph of reason, was viewed as an epoch in which the force of faith
 would regain its vigor. The death of God was inaugurating a new era of
 religious searching.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 The problem of modernity, observed Croce in 1908, was above all a
 religious problem: "The entire contemporary world is searching for a
 religion," driven by the "need for an orientation concerning life and
 reality, the need for a concept of life and reality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 In this sense all the avant-garde movements that arose in Italy prior
 to fascism aspired to be religious movements, to elaborate a new sense
 of life and the world, to propagate it through modern myths for the
 education of the masses and their integration into the national State,
 to give them the collective conscience of the nation as a community of
 values and of destiny.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The religious problem, observed Antonio Anzilotti, a young historian
 who contributed to <I>La Voce</I>, was inherent in the very nature of
 modernity, an age that had begun with an affirmation of disbelief but
 now was setting off in search of a religious faith from which it could
 draw new energies for action: "only the religious sense of life, which
 identifies the realization of the common weal with the development of
 the better part of our personality, can give absolute value to each
 individual and collective act."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 One might define the entire experiment of <I>La Voce</I> as an attempt
 to give modernity a new religious faith, an idealistic soul. Though they
 appreciated economic and industrial progress, the intellectuals centered
 around <I>La Vove</I> understood the 'conquest of modernity' above all
 as an increased capacity for man to control his own destiny. And for
 them the search for a new faith was strictly connected with the myth of
 Italianism, with the ideal of a new Italy that would be a protagonist
 in world affairs. "Italy must be intellectually great, it must give life
 to a modern civilization," proclaimed Prezzolini, the review's editor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 His faith in Italy was wholly shared by his colleagues, all firmly
 convinced that Italy was "a great nation, a nation pressed by the
 urgency of global competition, and it has declared that it will accept
 the struggle and hope in its

<B></B>

victory."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The goal to which the Vocians looked was the regeneration of the
 Italian character that would form the "soul" of a new Italy. <I>La
 Voce</I> championed the model of a modern Italian, who would derive
 from his humanistic faith moral energy and a capacity to live within
 "the multiform life of his age," to feel "truly with a sense of stupor,
 anger, veneration, rage, and love--the life of today."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The Italianism of <I>La Voce</I>, nevertheless, continued to coexist
 with a humanist and cosmopolitan vision that emphasized "an integral
 and humanistic education of man" as the basis for the formation of a
 modern Italian conscience, because "education is one thing alone, the
 education of <I>man</I>....One will not create good Italians if one
 has not first created good men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modernism of <I>La Voce</I> did not imply a rejection of history or
national tradition, but intended to avail itself of both as pedagogical
tools for the formation of the modern Italian. A religion, even a secular
and modern religion, had to have its own universe of myths and rites, just
as the modern nation of mass society could not do without myths by which
to educate the masses according to the principles and values of modern
humanism, the cultural and intellectual foundation of a new mass national
democracy. Only "by creating a myth for modern society, a catechism, a
clergy, will it be possible to realize practical democratic reform."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 History and tradition, for the Vocians, were sources on which to draw
 for constructing a secular mythology for the "modern religion," for
 forming the conscience of the modern Italian. Universal history could
 become "the true modern myth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 And yet the Vocians did not agree at all about which religion should
 be the educational foundation of the modern Italian. Prezzolini and
 those who were most influenced by Croce and Gentile thought they would
 elaborate a religion of modern man upon the foundations of neo-idealist
 philosophy. Others, such as Giovanni Boine, believed "that it will be
 Catholicism that will restore religion to the world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 It was this diversity of attitudes and ideals in their understanding
 of the religious need of modern man that prevented the Vocians from
 becoming a true and genuine movement, exponents of a total vision of
 life, of a new modern religion with myths, symbols, and rites. Others
 would soon fill the gap.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The militants of the nationalist movement were considerably more united
and decisive. They wished to institute "a religion of the nation" that
would integrate myths about the nation's past glories with myths of
modern greatness still to be conquered. As a model they took Japan,
which had completed a process of revolutionary modernization without
sacrificing its national tradition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Corradini also appealed to the experience of the French Revolution to
 invoke the institution of a "religion of the nation" as a spiritual
 force uniting the individual to the collecticity, perpetuating the sense
 of national identity across the successive generations through time
 (see <I>CL</I>, 23-30). The nation had to become the modern divinity
 of a new and secular religion that was to be propagated through the
 institution of rites and symbols, celebrating the cult of ancestry:
 "we have to create symbols that can enfold a collectivity, contain the
 masses, synthesize countless isolated cases of individual energies...the
 crowd, the collectivity, these must be the substitutes for the hero in
 the regime of today."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 The highest symbols of the "religion of the nation" in mass society
 were to be the monuments

<B></B>

realized not to celebrate an individual, but as an "expression of
collective and successive thought, of a social and national ideal." As
Morasso had already observed, in modern times the monumental presupposes
"the notion of collectivity, for it is made, to use a modern phrase, by
the public and for the public; only a people can quicken it into life,
and it is a people, or rather the soul of a people, that a monument must
contain and represent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 As an aesthetic model for the modern monument, Morasso proposed the
 machine, the collective creation of "countless energies disciplined
 and directed by strong discipline and an inflexible power to one goal;
 here one sees a true profusion of forces in search of the optimum and
 the enormous."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In modernist nationalism the aestheticization of politics stemmed directly
from the sacralization of politics, the process of institutionalizing
a secular religion necessary for the spiritual unity of a mass society
that wished to confront the challenges of modernity. The Futurists,
too, could easily have subscribed to this project of a "religion of
the nation," notwithstanding their very different attitude toward
history and tradition, poles apart from that of the Vocians and the
nationalists. Though they felt that the conquest of modernity required
the violent destruction of the nationalists' cult, they agreed with
them in wishing to place "Divina Italia" (Divine Italy) on the altar of
a secular religion, in glorifying the Italian race, and in endowing it
with an innate vocation for universal cultural preeminence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Boccioni was tormented at seeing "the brutish state in which the
 aesthetic ideals of our great country have fallen, even though we have
 40,000,000 inhabitants who are considered the most intelligent in the
 world." Yet he also firmly believed that "Italy is a young and strong
 country that will become great--period. In spiritual terms, everything
 has to be remade--and therefore, in aesthetic terms."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Futurism justified its furious iconoclasm of the past precisely on the
 grounds that it was necessary to proceed with a violent modernization of
 Italy, to launch it forward in the quest for new greatness. The Futurists
 argued they were "definitely at the head of world art," living proof
 that "the constructive Italian spirit is returning to dominance in the
 art of our age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the search for a secular religion for modern Italy, the modernist
avant-gardes inevitably entered into the realm of politics, where the
antagonism between differing ideals of modernity was more glaring and
their conflict unavoidable, for interest in the question spanned the
spectrum of Italian political and intellectual life. Croce, for example,
sought to create an Italian conscience that would be "not socialistic
and not imperialistic, but would reproduce in a new form that of the
Italian Risorgimento."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 His was a rational, liberal, bourgeois ideal of modernity that he
 considered fully capable of enabling Italy to address the challenges of
 modern life, guided by a parliamentary democracy, and from the century's
 beginning he had committed

<B></B>

himself to combatting the new mentality made up of mysticism, activism,
irrationalism, aestheticism, and imperialism, which he regarded as a
diseased and pathological form of modernity to be identified first with
decadence and later with fascism. But to most of the younger generation
the liberal and bourgeois ideal of modernity, transmitted by the founding
fathers of the national state, already seemed an inadequate model; and
within the culture of the avant-gardes, criticisms against Enlightenment,
rationalist, and individualist modernity were already widely diffused,
fed by the ideas of Nietzsche, Sorel, Pareto, and Croce himself. Yet this
widespread critique did not necessarily issue in anti-liberalism, and
many continued to search for other ways of integrating the new masses into
the nation and assuring the country of a system of government adapted to
guide it on its path through the vortex of modern life. Even the myth of
Italianism, which so conditioned the thought of the Italian avant-garde,
did not always issue in authoritarian nationalism. Futurism was typical in
this sense. From its origins it was averse to parliamentary democracy,
an attitude that was transformed into genuine political commitment
with interventionism and then, at the end of the Great War, with the
foundation of the Futurist Political Party. Though glorifying nationalism
and imperialism, Futurism retained a libertarian and cosmopolitan core,
and remained ready to favor radical social reforms providing they
were formulated with a recognition of the nation's preeminence. The
principal ideological motif of the Futurist political party during its
life from 1918 to 1920 remained the anarchistic utopia of a New State
governed by Futurist artists, where the maximum of individual liberty
and cultural cosmopolitanism would be reconciled with an intransigent
religion of the nation, with imperialism, and with a cult of violence and
the glorification of war as the impetus for a perpetually revolutionary
modernity, one that would impede the crystallization of traditionalist
inertia and make Italians live fully within the realm of modernity,
leading "an adventurous, energetic, and quotidianly heroic life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Within the circles surrounding <I>La Voce</I>, too, the predominant motif
 was one reconciling nationalism with cosmopolitanism, the freedom of the
 individual with the national state. The Vocians proposed a new national
 democracy, but their concept of democracy remained rather vague within
 the diversity of understandings of it that the journal proposed, though
 it is also true that the review sometimes supported concrete reforms
 such as universal suffrage, administrative decentralization, and free
 trade. The apparent contradiction was inherent in the composite nature
 of <I>La Voce</I>, made up of an empirical reformist current and a
 revolutionary idealist current that conceived of the new politics as
 having a missionary task to regenerate the character of the Italian
 people. <I>La Voce</I> dissolved before the outbreak of the Great
 War, but many of the Vocians entered politics in order to support,
 often on different grounds, Italian intervention. Many considered it
 the true and genuine test of modernity for the nation, the proof its
 ascent to the role of a great power. Only the nationalists such as
 Corradini and Morasso elaborated a genuinely authoritarian paradigm of
 modernity. Liberal democracy, in their view, was "in contradiction with
 the movement of modern life,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 because the very process of the development of mass democracy, both in

<B></B>

socialism and the expanding economy of capitalism, led to an affirmation
of "the primacy of force and the necessity of an ever vaster and deeper
dominion, renewing some of the characteristic conditions of the ancient
civilizations based on domination."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 The development of modernization, by the very nature of modernity in
 the age of imperialism, required new forms of authoritarianism for mass
 society: "Reappearing everywhere are oligarchic tendencies, military
 dominations, systems extolling strong aristocracies of leadership, a
 government that is absolute and energetic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Germany and Japan were seen as models for the Italian conquest of
 modernity in a new age of despotism by 'imperial civilization,' a
 direction in which all the great nation-states were headed, according
 to Morasso.

What in political terms the militant and authoritarian nationalists of
the avant-garde shared was their contestation of the "Giolitti system,"
which was viewed as a corrupting form of parliamentary dictatorship;
and an aspiration toward the construction of a New State by means of a
'<I>rivoluzione spirituale</I>' (mental revolution) meant to produce
a political revolution as well. In part this aspiration expressed a
generational revolt conducted under the banner of the myth of youth, youth
as a force revolutionary and regenerative in itself. All the movements
that contested the "Giolitti system," and the Futurists above all, shared
a belief in the myth of youth: the struggle of the healthy and vitalist
young against the corrupt and senescent old men was a necessary phase
in the conquest of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 The young possessed particular regenerative qualities that gave them
 the attitudes and prerogatives suitable for a new ruling class capable
 of guiding the nation through the tempests of modernity. The old ruling
 class was a caretaker of the past; the new aristocracy was the vanguard
 of the new Italians who would be "builders of the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 The young, whether of the right or the left, were convinced that
 they possessed the ethical values and moral qualities needed to bring
 about a mental revolution that would be the premise and condition of a
 political revolution, "radically changing the entire soul of man," as
 Papini proclaimed in 1913 when he was engaged in the Futurist campaign
 to prepare "in Italy the advent of this new man."

The myth of regenerative violence--through war or revolution--is part
of the cultural heritage of the modernist avant-garde. What sparked
the interventionism of many young intellectuals was the conviction that
Italy, in order to reach the state of modern greatness, would have to
pass through a bloody experience of war and give

<B></B>

its contribution to the creation of a new civilization. For Italy,
participation in the Great War was the entry "into the great history
of the world," as the philosopher Giovanni Gentile argued at the end of
the conflict.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Significantly, Marinetti preferred to use the term "conflagration" to
 define the Great War, alluding to the Heraclitean and Stoic myth of
 palingenesis by the great fire, from which, in this case, would rise
 a new and Futurist Italy. War, in the Futurist conception, was "the
 great and sacred law of life," it was the periodic "testing, bloody
 and necessary, of the force of the people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 Though with different motivations, a positive conception of war in
 the life of the nation was predominant throughout the new national
 culture. War was an integral part of the nationalist vision of
 modernity. Corradini defended the "modernity of war."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Already in 1905 Morasso, with a tragically prophetic spirit,
 had announced that "the nineteenth century was the century of a

 force and conquest....It is in the new century that force will have
 its largest kingdom, and it is in the new century that we will see ever

<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Amendola attributed a moral significance to war, a collective test of
 discipline and sacrifice in which the character of the individual and

The outbreak of the Great War was, in a certain sense, both foreseen and
anticipated by the culture of the avant-garde. On the threshold of the war
Italy was in a state of messianic expectation of an incumbent catastrophe
that would be palingenetic, a catastrophe that the avant-gardes were
invoking in order to realize the mental revolution necessary to regenerate
the nation and bring it to the conquest of modernity. When war broke out
the majority of the militants of the avant-garde became active supporters
of intervention. "Reality is moving with an accelerated rhythm. We have
had the singular privilege of living at the most tragic hour in the

 So wrote Mussolini on 18 October 1914, announcing his conversion to
 the cause of interventionism. His choice cost him his expulsion from

 Futurist painter Carlo Carr&agrave;, "there is the drama of our entire

Setting aside the specific debates and conflicts that marked the relations
between Futurism and Fascism what constituted the principal cultural nexus
linking the culture of the avant-gardes and fascism was the search for
a symbiosis between art and life, culture and politics, nationalism and
modernity--a search enacted through the myth of Italianism. But there
were also a number of other features of fascist political culture that
connect it very directly with the culture of the modernist avant-gardes
in the early twentieth century, features that constituted essential
traits of fascist political modernism.

Above all the activist conception of life within fascism was typically
modernist. That conception, as the newspaper for the Italian Battle Fasces
explained, meant "knowing how to understand the times that we live in, to
adapt oneself to the changed atmosphere, to the events that succeed one
another, that accumulate in the panting vortex of modern civilization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 This activism was inseparable from fascism's irrationalist conception of
 politics, which affirmed the priority of lived experience over ideology
 and <I>faith</I> over theory in the formation of a political culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 Fascism's anti-theoretical relativism and its institutional
 experimentalism were another modernist trait within fascism, in
 concordance with an existentialist intuition of politics, which was
 now understood in its immediate and vitalistic origins as "daring, as
 attempt, as undertaking, as dissatisfaction with reality, as adventure,
 as a celebration of the rite of action."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 Typically modernist, moreover, was the affirmation of the primacy of
 mythic thought--in the sense articulated by Sorel--within a politics

Modernistic, too, was the mythic use of history and tradition, and
in particular the appeal to the heritage of Rome, an appeal that was
centainly one of the major motifs of fascism's polemics with Futurism,
which protested against the fascist cult of Rome and its encouragement
of classicizing sorts of realism in fascist art. Yet for fascism,
history--beginning with Roman history, above all--was not a temple in
which to contemplate

<B></B>

and nostalgically venerate the grandeur of remote glories, carefully
preserving the memories consecrated by archaeological remains. It was
an arsenal from which to draw myths of mobilization and legitimization
for political action. The archaeological recovery of Roman ruins was not
dissociated from this exigency of the mythic construction of fascism's
symbolic universe. The cult of Romanness, in this sense, was celebrated
modernisitically as a myth of action for the future:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is not a nostalgic contemplation of the past, but hard preparation for
the future. Rome is our starting point and our reference point; it is our

what made up the immortal spirit of Rome is resurgent in fascism.... It
is indispensable that the history of tomorrow, which we assuredly want to
create, not be a contrast or a parody of the history of yesterday. The
Romans were not only combatants, but also formidable constructors who

The appeal to Romanness had the value of a mythic foundation for a
fascist politics looking to create a new civilization for the modern
age, one as solid and universal as the civilization of the Romans.
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 Like Italians of the Renaissance, the fascists viewed Rome as a source of
 inspiration for civic virtues, a sense of the State, a sacralization of
 politics, and universal organizing values--all elements for elaborating a
 modern model of a new civilization. In this sense the cult of Romanness
 was reconciled, without notable contradiction, with other elements of
 fascism that were more strictly futurist, such as its activism, its cult
 of youth and sport, the heroic ideal of adventure, and above all the
 will to experience the new continually in action projected toward the
 future, without reactionary nostalgia for an ideal of past perfection
 to be restored. To be sure, there were also fascist intellectuals
 who idealized the harmony of the good old days, such as the writers
 associated with <I>Strapaese</I> and the artists who theorized a return
 to the classical order of Renaissance art. But the principal impulse
 of fascism stemmed from its "movementist" and Dionysian feeling for
 existence, from the <I>myth of the future</I>, and not from the static
 contemplation of the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fascism had no nostalgia for a lost paradise to be reconstructed. It
never instituted a cult of tradition as the sublimation of the past in
a metaphysical vision of inviolable order, to be preserved whole, to be
segregated from the accelerated rhythm of modern life. Fascism recognized
tradition as "one of the great mental forces of peoples"; it was not
something "sacred, immutable, and untouchable," but a "successive and
constant creation of their soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 The past was supposed to be a "springboard of combat from which to
 launch into the future,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 and the fascists considered themselves, like the Futurists, to be
 "constructors of the future." The Italian created by Mussolini, in one
 novel by a Futurist writer, was depicted as a "modern barbarian...a
 modern man stretching out toward the future with spiritual tentacles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>
 From Futurism fascism had absorbed a dynamic feeling of modernity that

condemned, to obey the command of its original essence and to project
itself into the future, towards new realities to be constructed. "We

Fascist modernism sought to realize a new synthesis between tradition
and modernity, without renouncing modernization in order to realize the
nation's goals of power. Even though fascism exalted the ideal of <I>il

traditions, fascism was not anti-industrialist and it did not reject
technological progress; technology was an instrument of the modern
civilization that fascism could never renounce without being obliged to
renounce its ambitions to power. The progress of mechanized civilization,
said one writer in <I>Gerarchia</I> (the principal intellectual review
of the regime) was "the sign of the power of modernization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>

 The advance of machines was a feature of modern society that could not be

<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 The machine was an instrument for liberating man from the servitude of
 work, a weapon of conquest for the nation's will to power. To be sure,
 there were also elements of ambiguity in the fascist attitude toward
 modernity, elements that partly attenuated the modernist enthusiasm of
 early twentieth-century nationalism. A distinction within its vision
 of modernity was introduced between "sane" modernity and "perverse"
 modernity. Reversing Croce's understanding of modernity, the fascists
 pretended to be the artificers of sane modernity and the antagonists of
 that perverse modernity that stemmed from Enlightenment values of liberal
 reason. They had discovered a new "formula for modern society," capable
 of saving Western civilization from the degenerations of industrialism,
 mechanism, and urbanism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
  This formula, however, imposed the renunciation of individualism and
  freedom, the cause of modernity's perverse effects, under the banner of
  the absolute primacy of the national collectivity as organized by the
  totalitarian state. Though it inherited many of the motifs and myths
  of modernist nationalism, fascism recomposed and adapted them in an
  original form of political modernism that wished to bring to completion
  the conquest of modernity through the totalitarian revolution. That
  revolution, like the mental revolution of the avant-gardes, was to be a
  total revolution, affecting every aspect of individual and collective
  life, from habits to character, in order to regenerate the nation,
  forge the new Italian, and construct a new society, subjugating the
  machine to the "service of man and the collectivity as an instrument
  of liberation, not as a source of misery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 Italian modernity, as constructed by fascism, was to be a society of
 man, in which humanity would recover its dominion over the society of
 the machine. The totalitarian state and the sacralization of politics,
 integrating the masses into the nation through the faith, rituals, and
 symbols of fascist religion, were the foundations of a modern order that

<B></B>

would be capable of channelling and using all the energies of
modernization to the advantage of national power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the sacralization of politics and the institutionalization of the
cult of the fasces, fascism realized, in forms that were distinctively
its own, another aspiration of modernist nationalism, the construction
of a lay religion for the nation. Artists of Futurist provenance, such as
Sironi, architects who were exponents of modernistic rationalism, such as
Giuseppe Terragni and Giuseppe Pagano, promoters of experimental theater
such as Giulio Antonio Bragaglia, faithfully and passionately contributed
to the construction of the symbolic universe of fascist religion, helping
its myths and ideals to be represented to the masses and perpetuated
through time. The fascist aesthetic of the Futurists was consistent with
their conception of the political function of art and their faith in
the religion of the nation. Futurist art, within fascism, was supposed
to express the deep forces of the modern soul through "representative
symbols of the new religious spirit that will bind together this century
and from which nobody will escape, for it is universal and lasting."

For fascism the synthesis of politics, religion, and ethics, or Italian
modernity, was to be actualized in new political institutions, in a new
secular relighion, and in modernization serving the aggrandizement of
national power. Above all, however, it was to be actualized as a way
of living, a <I>stype of life</I>. Style was what defined the original
and universal essence of a society and what transmitted its greatness
to future eras. Fascist modernism pursued the original impulse of
the Futurists in its search for a new and original <I>modern Italian
style</I>, deliberately privileging modern art over traditionalist
classicism in accordance with Mussolini's own desire. Among fascist
artists it was perhaps Sironi, Mussolini's preferred painter, who knew
best how to interpret and represent the political-aesthetic ideal of
Italian modernity. Sironi believed that fascism was the most advanced
political expression of modernity itself, which he saw as an "epoch of
grandiose myths and gigantic upheavals."
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 Fascist art, in all its manifestations, was to create the style of
 fascist modernity, to express the "complex orchestrations of modern

<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>
 Sironi's modernism integrated art and politics in an affirmation of a
 collective will to power, and it linked the artist with the political
 experiment of the totalitarian state in the creation of a new religion
 of Italianness. The fascist artist had

<B></B>

a mission: with a modern sensibility, mythically to recall the great ages
of Italian art, seeking to realize a new creative greatness, a synthesis
between the classic and the modern, an epic transration of fascist
politics. Myths and symbols, as in the great religious art of the past,
were to impress "a new impulse on the popular soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same ideal of integrating art and politics in the search for an
Italian modernity inspired the modernist poetics of Massimo Bontempelli,
a former Futurist militant like Sironi and organizer of the movement
<I>Novecento</I>. In his view, the new art of fascism would harmonize
with modernity, an era he saw as "an age of activity and conquest," or
one "avid of conquest," by inventing "the myths and stories necessary
for new times."
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 Bontempelli believed in the coming of a "Third Age" of humanity in
 which it would be the task of Italian artists, "the primordial people
 of a new era, to discover and create new myths, new stories that will
 nurture the youth of the Third Age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>
 Through an aesthetic of "magical realism" they would give the future
 an intuition of modern life, "as an adventurous miracle: continuous
 risk and continuous effort to get through it safely," even at its
 "most normal and quotidian."
<SUP><a NAME="REF108" HREF="#FOOT108">108</a></SUP>
 Even Bontempelli's modernism was wedded to the religion founded on the
 myth of "Italianism." Italy's cultural preeminence was "irrefutable";
 she was unique among the nations because "alive with an eternal spirit"
 that from one age to another renewed "her office of instigator of
 civilization," a spirit that now, after the Great War, had returned
 and assumed the task of creating the myths of modern society.

Intellectuals and artists of this sort, who had been active in the
modernist avant-garde and Futurism, enthusiastically participated
in fascism and contributed to elaborating its cultural politics and
its aesthetic style. In it they saw a political weapon for realizing
the avant-gardist myth of <I>total revolution</I>, understood as an
intellectual and spiritual revolution that was supposed to modify the
essence and values of life, giving rise to a new art, a new style of
life, a new man. They participated in fascism, it must be emphasized,
rather than simply adhering to it. For the involvement of Futurism in
fascism was not simply an external act of joining a political movement,
but an active and self-aware collaboration in elaborating the movement's
culture and political style, that went as far as a substantial agreemnent
between avant-garde culture and totalitarian political culture regarding
certain fundamental themes. In fact the Futurists, in arguing for a
Futurist paternity for fascism, stressed those elements that could
easily be integrated into totalitarian culture: from the religion of
<I>Italianismo</I> (Italianness) to the search for an Italian modernity,
to the heroicization of life and the glorification of war.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After the failure of the experience with a Futurist political party in
1920, Futurist politics, as captained by Marinetti, swiftly renounced
the libertarian motifs of its ideology and the utopia of Futurist
democracy. With the advent of fascism to power, Marinetti and the
Futurists returned to fascism with a de facto acceptance of its
politics as the "minimal program" of the Futurist revolution. Perhaps
they also trusted that fascism, once it had consolidated and developed
its totalitarian politics, would gradually surpass or set aside some
of the more conservative and reactionary forms dictated by political
contingency, slowly approaching the "maximal program" of the

<B></B>

Fururist revolution. With their artificial optimism, the Futurists
struggled to accelerate this process within the regime, voluntarily
collaborating in the political culture of the totalitarian state and
the construction of fascist religion's sxymbolic universe. Moreover,
the return was also accompanied by a change in the Futurist vision of
modernity, a transformation that rendered it much closer to fascism's own,
with its distinction between a sane and a perverse modernity. Sharply
attenuating the modernist enthusiasm that had marked the early years
of the twentieth century, it largely abandoned the goals of radical and
total renovation of human existence in a libertarian and individualistic
sense, while increasingly it exalted the myths of bellicose, imperialist
nationalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF110" HREF="#FOOT110">110</a></SUP>
 In effect its tragic sense of existence as an unredeemable reality gained
 the upper hand over its enthusiasm for modernity, which now appeared
 to the Futurists in the perverse forms of "bureaucratic cancer" and
 the mucification of society through new forms of conformism. Even the
 fascist state was affected by these perverse forms of modernity, which
 rendered it all the more remote from the New State originally dreamt
 of by Futurism. From this point of view one can indeed maintain that
 the original matrix of Futurism largely faded away under the fascist
 regime. The Futurists, however, were not obliged to make a serious
 sacrifice of their theoretical coherency in order to participate
 with renewed enthusiasm in the cultural politics of the totalitarian
 state. They had, after all, always proclaimed that the religion of the
 nation was to prevail over the principle of freedom. The essence of
 Futurist freedom was not political freedom, but the creative freedom
 of genius, a sort that could easily adapt itself to living within a
 regime that never pretended to impose aesthetic conformism and that
 glorified politics as the art of shaping the masses, calling upon
 artists to collaborate in the task of forging the new Italian. To be
 sure, the fascist new man, regimented in the organizations of the
 regime and educated according to the rigid rules of discipline and
 military uniformity, was a "mass-Italian" that departed significantly
 from the Futurist ideal of the "unique--type Italian." But the Futurists
 ignored this discordance of ideals, accepting the fascist revolution as
 an initial phase toward the realization of the Futurist revolution. As
 Marinetti had announced in 1920

of mythical thought, the vitalist realism, the mystical exaltation
of national community, the heroic and warlike pedagogy, the imperial
ambitions, or the myth of the Italian nation as the vanguard of a new
society. The Futurists were neither deceived nor misled by fascism; they
were fascinated by its appeal for the total mobilization of culture to
regenerate Italians in a religious cult of the nation and to construct
a new society that would leave its mark upon the future in the style of
'Italian modernity.' No Futurist believed that Fascism harbored the
intention of realizing a world of reason, freedom, equality, or peace.

l'uomo moderno vive senza la fede passata e senza una fede presente e
spesso senza neppure la fede in una fede futura. Destinato a preparare
una civilt&agrave; nuova, si sente sacrificato, senza neppure assurgere
alla coscienza di questo sacrificio, che potrebbe renderlo grande. Vive
spesso la sua tragedia, senza salire tant'alto con lo spirito da farsi
lui Fato e dominare il proprio intreccio. Di qui lo sgomento, la nerezza,
il nichilismo di tante anime.... L'individuo non &egrave; pi&ugrave;
retto da dighe sociali che separavano, ma sostenevano, che impedivano il
salire ma non permettevano il cadere, ed &egrave; ogni giorno davanti
all'alternativa di diventare padrone del mondo o l'ultimo straccio di
carne che una forza cieca afferri per ripulire le vie. Si sente che
qualche cosa di grande &egrave; in gestazione, ma l'immenso sforzo torce
