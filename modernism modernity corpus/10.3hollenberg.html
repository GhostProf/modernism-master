<p>
Like such contemporaries as John Ashbery and Barbara Guest, Denise
Levertov expressed "an affinity with visual art," claiming that "looking
at art" was a true and lasting love.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Remembering key moments in her artistic development, she mentions her
early adolescence in London where, motivated by weekly drawing lessons
with a British landscape painter, she frequented the Victoria and Albert
Museum and the National Gallery and became acquainted with the landscapes
of C&eacute;zanne, for which she had a lifelong passion (<i>T,</i>
106). As a novice she was mentored by the art critic and poet, Herbert
Read, to whom she dedicated her first book, <i>The Double Image,</i>
and among her unpublished juvenilia are many autobiographical drawings,
full of humor and wit, which show the encouragement of her mother, who
was herself an amateur artist. In fact, so strong was this affinity that,
as a young girl, she dreamed of being both an artist and a poet&#8212;as
well as a ballerina.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Thus, it is not surprising that, when she settled in New York City
after World War II, her friends included artists associated with
the Jane St. Gallery, such as Nell Blaine, in whose sketching group
she participated, as well as Albert Kresch, Leland Bell, Louisa
Matthiasdotter, and, a little later, Howard Fussiner.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
From the beginning, she turned in her poetry to the materiality of the
visual arts to express spiritual energy and force. As she put it in an
early poem, addressing artists in both media:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Incise, invent, file to poignance;
<br />
make your elusive dream

<b></b>

<br />
seal itself
<br />
in the resistant mass of crude substance.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet, the ekphrastic impulse, the desire to write poems about specific
paintings, did not become strong until <i>A Door in the Hive</i>
, after her spiritual quest had resulted in a turn toward
Roman Catholicism in the early 1980s, inspired in part by the active
opposition of radical clergy members to oppressive political regimes
in Latin America. In this book, Levertov continued the work of social
protest and spiritual contemplation evident in earlier poems written in
response to the atrocities of World War II and the Vietnam War. In fact,
the longest poem in this book, "El Salvador: Requiem and Invocation,"
combines these two impulses. It is the libretto for an oratorio about
the martyrdom of Archbishop Oscar Romero and three nuns. Their sympathy
with the struggles of the native poor led to their murder by right
wing death squads aided by the American government in what could be
construed as a continuation of earlier American foreign policy which
Levertov opposed. In this book she included four poems about works of
art and/or visual artists in the context of a perceived analogy between
"the journey of art and the journey of faith."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
Levertov's poems about works of art occur also in the context of her
ongoing concern about how political resistance is to be expressed
in lyric poetry. As Alicia Ostriker has written, distinguishing "the
poetics of postmodern witness" from confessional poetry, some poets
after World War II have reacted to Theodore Adorno's famous declaration
that there can be no poetry after Auschwitz with renewed determination
to continue the struggle with the self that is also the struggle with
what Auschwitz stands for&#8212;"not only the Holocaust but also the
ongoing concatenation of horrors scarring twentieth-century history."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
They have done so, as Ostriker puts it, "by avoiding a poetics
<i>purely</i> of the self," on one hand, and by refusing to abandon the
lyric "I," on the other, lest they deny a consciousness "that desires,
suffers and chooses," and thus provides an ethical and political model
for the reader.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Ostriker does not include Levertov's ekphrastic poems in her discussion,
choosing instead long poems by contemporary poets who employ the
fragmented structures and polyglot allusions associated with Eliot,
Pound, and Williams while regaining the autobiographical "I" rejected by
these exemplars of high modernism. Although Levertov solves the formal
problem in a different way in her ekphrastic poems, the main issue she
struggles with is the same: how to mirror and transcend the confusion
and angst of a person caught in a world of catastrophe. Thus, Ostriker's
designation, "the poetics of postmodern witness," is applicable.
<p>
This essay will focus upon Levertov's poems about works by five visual
artists, Anselm Kiefer, Chaim Soutine, Jean Duvet, Eduardo Chillida, and
Emmanuel de Witte, the contemplation of which helped her to bridge the
gulf between a despairing political awareness and an "imagined destination
of faith" (<i>NSE,</i> 257). I will explore the ways in which Levertov
employs ekphrastic poetry, the genre in which "texts encounter their
own semiotic 'others,'" to negotiate the ground between self, world,
and divinity that is <i>her</i> version of postmodern witness.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
By turning to these "others"&#8212;works by visual

<b></b>

artists with whom she feels allied&#8212;Levertov avoids indulgence in
private malaise and indirectly expresses concerns about the limits of
poetic language, her own medium. When we read these poems in sequence we
find that her initial focus on the relative poverty of words (a coded
medium) contrasted with the more direct power of visual experience
shifts to a focus upon perspective, an attribute of both arts. This
shift ultimately yields a poem, "The Composition," based on de Witte's
"Woman at the Harpsichord," a painting from a golden age in Western
culture, in which Levertov celebrates de Witte's ability to embody a
timeless ideal of peace even as she laments the distance between then
and now. In this poem Levertov expresses "ekphrastic hope," in that the
estrangement of the image/text division is overcome by the evocation of a
"a 'still moment' of plastic presence through language."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Yet her awareness that such an evocation is metaphoric, momentary,
and burdened by the tragic weight of history, infuses this poem, and
indeed the whole sequence of poems about paintings, with existential
and religious pathos. Also, in these poems, Levertov serves as an
intermediary between works of art and her audience of listening or
reading others by converting fixed scenes into poetic dramas that we
"see" in the mind's eye and thus experience vicariously.
<p>
We find Levertov's growing desire for a focus that is not merely
confessional in the prefatory note to her 1978 volume, <i>Life in the
Forest,</i> where she introduces a group of poems inspired by Cesare
Pavese, with the following words:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Pavese's beautiful poems are about various persons other than himself;
though he is a presence in them also, their focus is not autobiographical
and egocentric, and in his accompanying essays he speaks of the concept
of suggesting narrative through the depiction of a scene, a landscape,
rather than through direct recounting of events as such. The poems I
had been moving towards were impelled by two forces: first, a recurring
need&#8212;dealt with earlier by resort to a diarylike form, a poem long
enough to include prose passages and discrete lyrics&#8212;to vary a
habitual lyric mode; not to abandon it, by any means, but from time to
time to explore more expansive means; and second, the decision to try to
avoid overuse of the autobiographical, the dominant first-person singular
of so much American poetry&#8212;good and bad&#8212;of recent years.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Levertov's turn to ekphrasis was another instance of this impulse. It
was also a means of distancing herself from the threatening historical
reality of London before and during World War II. The art museum has
been called "the shrine where all poets worship in a secular age"
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
and in the poem, "Winter Afternoons in the V. and A., pre-W.W.II,"
Levertov remembers seeking a respite from the unceasing rain in the
"darkening afternoon streets" within the "lofty and vast halls" of the
Victoria and Albert Museum.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
She writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Here was history
<p>
as I desired it: magical, specific,<br />
jumbled, unstinting,

<b></b>

<p>
a world for the mind to sift
<br />
in its hourglass&#8212;now, while I was twelve,
<br />
or forever.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
In that poem the shoes of the girl in the museum "made no sound," and
Levertov chooses a mysterious relationship between speech and silence
as the theme of the first poem in <i>A Door in the Hive,</i> the book in
which a cluster of her poems about paintings appear. It is an invocation,
"To Rilke," in which she recalls a dream in which the poet stands at
the prow of a boat in a state of receptivity, "all voice, though silent."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
He is about to take the passengers on a "needful journey" (<i>DIH,</i>
3). That this need is for an experience of divinity is evident in the
last poem in the collection, a variation on a poem in <i>The Book of
Hours,</i> also inspired by Rilke, in which he distills his quest for
an unmediated and intimate encounter with the heart of the universe.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
In Levertov's variation of Rilke's poem, the speaker wishes to be part of
"the vast mosaic&#8212;temple, eidolon," to be "imbedded in its fabric, /
as if, once, it was from that we were broken off" (<i>DIH,</i> 107). In
a different form, her ekphrastic poems also express this desire for a
religious encounter unmediated by words.
<p>
<i>A Door in the Hive</i> is divided into six sections. In her notes on
its organization, Levertov conceives its emotional curve as beginning in
artistic quest and modulating into life journey and religious quest. She
places in the second section poems about "world pain" from a variety
of perspectives.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
This is where the oratorio about El Salvador appears and her first
ekphrastic poem, "The Book Without Words," inspired by a painting by
Anselm Kiefer, follows immediately after it. Levertov described her
admiration for Kiefer's work in a letter to James Laughlin written after
she saw a Kiefer show in New York: "Kiefer is very impressive&#8212;the
link with Paul Celan is more than superficial, I feel. . . . the images
he creates are powerful and convey something about the 20<sup>th</sup>
century as no other <i>visual</i> art has done."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
She refers here both to Kiefer's <i>Margarethe and Sulamith</i>
paintings, which draw on the poetic evocation of the Holocaust and the
death camps in Celan's poem, "Fugue of Death," and to Kiefer's view of
the dilemma of the artist in the twentieth century in such paintings as
"The Book" (1979-85)," the source of her own poem. For if, as I mentioned
earlier, Adorno's proscription left artists with an aesthetic ethics of
visual absence and poetic silence, Kiefer's work explicitly thematizes
that dilemma. Born in Germany in 1945, Kiefer is not only driven by
explorations of a specifically German identity in the postwar world,
but also by the question of what it means to create in the aftermath
of fascism and genocide. In Kiefer's work "the very act of creating,
and the very fact of being an artist, is always bound up with, or
founded in, its place in the present, a present shaped by the legacy
of historical trauma."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Levertov was clearly interested in the critique of European culture
that Kiefer's painting depicts, and she was probably also drawn to his
reinvention of traditional forms, particularly landscape and history
painting. As Simon Schama points out, "What he did was to collapse the one
into the other, exactly reversing abstraction's metaphysical obligations
to push the implications of painting beyond and through the painting."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<b></b>

Kiefer rejected the "uncoupling of painterly process and its ostensible
objects" characteristic of some forms of abstraction with their implied
insistence that "the only interesting subject left for art was art"
(<i>LM,</i> 124). Where "Abstraction prized lightness, flatness, the
airy, and the cerebral. . . . Kiefer turned back to German expressionism,
for the raw texture, the gritty materiality, of historical truth"
(<i>LM,</i> 126). His paintings returned compositional lines back to
their narrative function. This formal position is analogous to Levertov's
rejection of the captious wit of language poetry, notwithstanding
the related political goals of its advocates. Certainly, in her poem,
"The Book Without Words," she responds to Kiefer's compression of form
and narrative, subtly employing point of view to interpret his use
of perspective.
<p>
When we first look at this painting, we are immediately struck by the
weight of the forged lead book in the center of the foreground (<A
NAME="1" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#1"> 1</a>). We
tend <i>then</i> to see details of the destroyed landscape around it,
composed of acrylic, emulsion, and shellac on canvas. In the body of
her poem Levertov reverses the order of this visual experience and
thereby intensifies the relationship between re and ground. She
begins by placing herself inside the painting&#8212;on the horizontal
line near the top&#8212;the "verge" of a "limitless ocean" (<i>DIH,</i>
40). The threatening "gray waves gnash / their teeth of foam" directly
in front of her (<i>DIH,</i> 40). Behind her is "the barren plain, /
seamed, fissured," composed not of earth but of "cinders" (<i>DIH,</i>
40). From this foreclosed position, the "dark and darkening" sky appears
to "bear down," and the nature of the future is uncertain at best. Instead
of offering "the ultimate direction" for a sea-voyage, the huge wordless
book "levitates, close to the hiss of spume, / / immutable, desolate"
(<i>DIH,</i> 40). It has no place on the burned ground. In her view it
is a symbol of empty, failed civilization

<b></b>

and/or of traumatized historical memory: no matter how they are
manipulated its contents are "unresonant" . . . "void upon void"
(<i>DIH,</i> 40). Levertov also employs stanza length and enjambment
to reinforce her interpretation of Kiefer's painting and to bring its
meaning home to us emphatically at the end. Reading the poem is a little
like riding the waves: the units of sound gradually increase until we come
to the last two lines, abrupt full stops: "You have come to the shore. /
There are no directions" (<i>DIH,</i> 40). As if to distinguish human
potential from the shame of the historical record, Levertov placed at the
end of this section, "On the Mystery of the Incarnation," a contrasting
poem about the word of God incorporated in the life of Christ.
<p>
If Kiefer records historical trauma and collective guilt in this painting
and in others in which he takes as his subject, "Germany's now absent
other, the Jew" (<i>AK,</i> 3), the same could be said of the paintings of
Chaim Soutine, the subject of the second ekphrastic poem in Levertov's
book. Except here her subject <i>is</i> that Other. For Soutine's
Jewishness has always been central to the interpretation of his work.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
This Lithuanian-born, shtetl-bred artist was one of the group, including
Chagall, who settled in Paris at the beginning of the twentieth
century, in flight from the menace of ill-treatment and racial hatred
that promised to grow worse. During World War II, like many Jews in
occupied France, he hid until he could hide no longer. Severely ill
with what may have been a perforated ulcer, he made his way from his
hiding place in the French countryside to a Paris hospital, where he
died in 1943. In the aftermath of the war, his life and art came to be
seen as a reflection and portent of the tragic events of contemporary
history. He became known for his ability to depict the pathos of everyday
life, its suffering and anguish, and for the intensity of his religious
longing. Levertov's poem reflects both of these interpretations. Titled
"Soutine (Two Paintings)," it is a verbal composite of two works,
"Still Life With Herrings"  and "Red Stairway at Cagnes" (1923-34)
which, in Levertov's view, epitomize the artist's interior drama
(. <a name="2" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#2">2</a>
and <a name="3" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#3">3</a>).
<p>
The essence of that drama, for Levertov, is an implied link between the
abject and the sacred. Moving back and forth, in the first stanza, between
Soutine's boldly expressive images of hunger, loss, desperation, and
unbridled desire in each painting, she dramatizes their connection. With
the repeated conditional phrase, "As if," she conveys the dream-like
way in which the "desperate things" in both paintings&#8212;the "forks"
and "red steps"&#8212;are sublimations of Soutine's feelings of being
rejected and outcast (<i>DIH,</i> 54). "Avid," "famished," "clutching,"
they nevertheless resist the restraints and negation imposed on his
subjectivity by the increasingly hostile outside world, represented here
by desiccated mythic symbols of life and love&#8212;"dead scrawny fish,"
"dead-white plate," and "abandoned cup" (ibid). In two apostrophes, "O
desperate things," and "O grey void," Levertov acknowledges Soutine's
increasingly noxious situation in a world devoid of humane or even
human content (ibid). The second stanza focuses on the second painting
alone. Here Levertov underscores Soutine's desire to take possession
of even this intolerable landscape: the skepticism of the leaning,
"wavering" houses, expressed in a rhetorical question, "and what could
there be / up there / to fulfil desire?" does not undercut nor deter
the fervent urgency of his visionary climb (ibid). His gesture is that
of an inspired mystic. In her notes on the book's organization,

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 526]</b>

Levertov explicitly recognizes the religiosity of Soutine's art. She
places "Soutine (Two Paintings)" in a third section of poems that is
"overtly religious," commenting that it reintroduces the theme of artistic
quest in that context ("NOT").
<p>
Raymond Cogniat has compared Soutine's visionary message to a reading
of the Apocalypse of St. John, "in that it makes us feel that we are
experiencing an agonizing obsession with and affirmation of catastrophe
couched in the form not of a probable future but of a visible, present
reality."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
He writes that Soutine's paintings have "the brilliance and intensity of
medieval stained glass windows" (<i>S,</i> 68). In fact, Levertov also
may have felt this connection: the next ekphrastic poem in this book,
"A Woodcut," was inspired by an engraving in the <i>Apocalypse</i>
series by Jean Duvet, whose works provide "an artistic odyssey through
the worlds of late Gothic, Renaissance and Mannerist styles."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Born in Dijon in 1485, the same year as Luther, whose faith he
was to follow, Duvet lived in a period when there was considerable
French resentment toward Rome despite major attempts to consolidate
the Counter-Reformation forces. To avoid religious persecution, he
moved first to Geneva and, in his final years, to Lyon, a center of
French Protestantism and the graphic arts, noted for its erudition and
liberal thought (<i>MU,</i> 25). Here, at age 77, Duvet produced the
<i>Apocalypse</i> plates, his last and major work. Its chief source was
the D&uuml;rer woodcut "Apocalypse" of 1498. A man of many skills and
interests, including theology and probably alchemy, Duvet established his
own way of faith and his final images are "illuminated by a . . . sense
of the isolation of man before God" (<i>MU,</i> 25). Saint John, Duvet's
patron saint as well as the patron saint of printers, was viewed as
one of the first alchemists because of apocryphal accounts of his
transforming the pebbles on the riverbank to gold. Some art historians
see the concept of the Christian alchemist as an aspect of Duvet's
experience of the "Apocalypse" entirely in keeping with the intensely
personal nature of his art (<i>MU,</i> 43). Levertov's poem, based on the
engraving titled "The Angel Shows John the New Jerusalem," reflects this
independent, personal aspect of Duvet's vision; she condenses the first
part of the story depicted by the engraving and focuses on the second.
<p>
Duvet's composition is divided into two chief areas: the upper, curved
section is occupied by the heavenly Jerusalem, while the lower part
shows the haloed Saint John on the island of Patmos (<a name="4"
HREF="10.3hollenberg_res.html#4"> 4</a>). His annunciation
takes place within a rustic structure of apple trees, especially suited
for the theophany. While in ecstatic slumber there, he is approached by an
angel who tells him that he will take him to see the New Jerusalem. The
angel's staff points upward toward the holy city. His elevation to a
mountain top, from which he sees the heavenly Jerusalem, is shown at the
upper left where he kneels at the foot of the pointing angel. The handsome
city, inspired by architectural prints of the Renaissance, is before him
with its many angel-filled portals and throngs of saved souls who gaze
up at the miniscule re of the Lord at the top left of the plate. In
front of the central gate, an angel with a rod is measuring the city, and
Saint John reappears first on the right walking in the clouds, recording
the angel's measurements in a book. The seashore at the extreme right
may represent the sea and earth which will vanish from the Evangelist's
vision during his spiritual elevation. The chain of clouds crossing the
plate reinforces the barrier between new and old (<i>MU,</i> 290).

<b></b>

<p>
In the first stanza of her poem, Levertov places us almost directly into
the upper half of this engraving. She describes John walking through
the clouds "above the earthly orchards" (<i>DIH,</i> 67), writing as he
walks. The "river's moored boats and conversing swans," which John has
passed, warrant only her cursory attention (ibid). Instead of dwelling
on John's annunciation on Patmos, in the lower half of the plate, she
describes the scene at "burnished Jerusalem" in more detail, noting the
"upward-gazing" throng of the blessed, some of whom even lean their
arms on a balustrade "to dreamily scan implicit horizons / level with
their celestial vantage point" (ibid). This focus on the adoration of the
blessed presages Levertov's interest in John's ecstatic state of mind and
its effect on his behavior. In the second stanza, she embellishes Duvet's
vision, imagining John dizzy with a blissful confusion that appears to
increase his range: he looks every which way&#8212;"upward, outward, /
back at the angel (now behind him), downward, inward&#8212;" (ibid). Most
interesting, his spiritual elevation has caused him to dispense with his
old means of record-keeping: though his ink-bottle appears at his hip,
his notebook has either "vanished" or been "discarded (ibid)."
<p>
This poem appears in the fourth section of <i>A Door in the Hive</i> along
with another ekphrastic poem, also about dramatic shifts in perspective,
titled "The Sculptor (Homage

<b></b>

to Chillida)," about the work of the contemporary Spanish sculptor. Here
Levertov is inspired by this artist's entire <i>oeuvre</i> as well by
the particularity of sculpture itself. For "Heraclitus's maxim that
conflict is the father of all things applies to sculpture more than to
any other branch of the arts. The sculptor is in conflict with space,
which he usurps and appropriates to his own ends, and with matter,
from which the nascent form must struggle free."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Levertov may also have felt a bond with Chillida's hybrid spiritual
heritage, since she considered herself both Jewish-Christian and
Anglo-American. Born in 1924 in San Sebastin, the capital of a province
in the Basque country, a region divided between France and Spain,
Chillida claims origins that are legendary, even mythological. "He
is very close to nature, in which he worships occult forces and
the power of the elements," and he has a special feeling for metal,
"allegedly introduced into the southern valleys of the Pyranees by
the first blacksmith, Tubal Cain . . . 3000 years before our era"
(<i>C,</i> 6). His sculptures "have a very close affinity with their
material and acquire from it not only their plastic qualities, but also
their symbolic and elemental character." Iron takes on the form of the
unknown, "becoming the tuning-fork of unseen vibrations and the 'comb
of winds'" in one sculpture (ibid). Chillida also speaks eloquently
about his goals as a sculptor. On the wall of his studio is the saying,
"'A cloud of birds in the sky is better than a single one in the hand,'"
which he considers a challenge to achieve the impossible, something
which lies beyond the form (<i>C,</i> 7). He says he is interested in
the space created by the shapes, "'which dwells in them and is all the
more effective when it works in secret. I might perhaps compare it to
the life-giving breath which causes the form to swell up and contract and
makes visible that inner psychic space which is hidden from the outside
world'" (ibid). He compares sculpture with music: "'Sculpture and music
exist in the same harmonious and ever developing space. The volume of
musical sound fills the silence with tension; similarly there could be
no volume in sculpture without the emptiness of space'" (<i>C,</i> 8).
<p>
Chillida's comments about the relationship between sculptured form and
"inner psychic space" is analogous to Levertov's reflections about the
relationship between speech and silence in her ekphrastic poems. In her
tribute to Chillida, she begins with the psychological feat he performs
in his work, which she gives a Jungian twist by using the word "shadow"
in the first two lines: "A man who lives with his shadow / on equal
terms"(<i>DIH,</i> 69).
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Jung used the term "shadow" to refer to that part of the collective
unconscious that has the most frequent and disturbing influence on
the ego because "its nature can in large measure be inferred from the
personal unconscious."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The next four lines, which in their pattern on the page imitate the
tension she describes, also draw on Jung's ideas. He thought the shadow
posed a moral problem for the whole ego-personality because "no one
can become conscious of [it] without considerable moral effort. To
become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the
personality as present and real."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
In lines seven to eleven, Levertov implies that the transmutation
Chillida achieves is a result both of active will and of receptivity to

<p>
And he "permits stone / to acknowledge the inward void it compresses"
(ibid). Her last two stanzas refer to his "Comb of Wind" group (<A
NAME="5" href="10.3hollenberg_res.html#5"> 5</a>) which,
she imagines, were inspired by the sea, which she personifies, as well as
by the wind. In her extrapolation, Chillida has made combs for the sea's
"rushing tresses." These sculptures are "new gestures lifted / to the
wind, new spouts" from which the enlivened water leaps, "shouting" (ibid).
<p>
Other poems in <i>A Door in the Hive</i> also refer to specific works of
art, as well as attributes of the artist's vision, desire, and perceptual
process. For example, in "Wings in the Pedlar's Pack," Levertov compares
her father's experience of spiritual flight from Judaism to Christianity
with that of his countryman, Marc Chagall. In "Nativity: An Altarpiece,"
she refers to an anonymous church artifact, positing that in this piece
the "wondering animals" recognize the spiritual significance of Christ's
birth before the wise men or the sleeping shepherds. In "Ikon: The
Harrowing of Hell," she draws on the tradition of devotional painting in
the Eastern Orthodox Church to interpret Christ's descent into the realm
of the dead between the time of His Crucifixion and His Resurrection when,
according to Christian belief, he brought salvation to the souls

<b></b>

held captive. In this poem, written during Lent, she extends this
religious idea, imagining the difficulty of Christ's task to be not
only his rescue of the souls in Limbo, but also his painful return to
life, where he must "walk / the world again" and patiently await the
acts of human generosity that indicate communion and humble repentance
(<i>DIH,</i> 106). In "The Life of Art," she analyzes the ecstasy of even
a momentary change of perspective. Using the medium of "carnal paint" to
stand for all artistic media, she claims that "the borderland" between
one's medium and "fictive truth: a room, a vase, an open door / giving
upon the clouds" is the desired place to live. It is an "immeasurable,
elusive" psychological state, "an equilibrium" attainable sometimes,
"when the attention's rightly poised," during which one feels "opulently
received" into the world of the painting, and one almost sees "what
lies beyond the window, past the frame, beyond . . ." (<i>DIH,</i>
85). However, the poem in which she most fully expresses this boundary
experience is "The Composition," in her next book, <i>Evening Train</i>
, published after her final move to Seattle, an environment that
reminded her of her European home. Here ekphrasis enables her to fuse
social and spiritual concerns with issues of form.
<p>
The poem's title&#8212;"The Composition"&#8212;prompts us to see the
links between pictorial and poetic structure. As the epigraph indicates,
it was inspired by "Woman at the Harpsichord," a famous example of Dutch
genre painting in the mid-seventeenth century by Emmanuel de Witte,
an artist associated with the Delft School, who specialized in painting
church interiors. The painting depicts domestic life during what is often
considered a "golden age" of Dutch culture, the period after the United
Provinces of the Netherland, the first republic in Europe, had become
a major power and intellectual center, despite its small size, in part
because of its advanced shipbuilding industry, financial innovations,
and social organization. By this time most of the population in its three
most powerful provinces lived in small to medium-sized towns. While the
other states of Europe remained primarily rural, the Netherlands was
becoming a nation of townspeople, predominantly middle class.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Yet the particular bourgeois nature of Dutch society needs some
explanation. As Simon Schama has written, "At the center of the Dutch
world was a burgher not a bourgeois."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
The burgher was a "citizen first and <i>homo aeconomicus</i>
second. . . . the obligation of civism conditioned the opportunities of
prosperity" (<i>ER,</i> 7). This distinction is important to Levertov
both in her poem about the painting and in a letter explaining her
choice of subject.
<p>
"The Composition" is dedicated to the French poet Jean Joubert and the
American artist Howard Fussiner, both Levertov's contemporaries. Levertov
had included translations of fourteen of Joubert's poems in an earlier
book, <i>Oblique Prayers</i> , including a poem based on a painting
by Holbein. She chose to open this selection with "Wind Script," a poem
expressing the vulnerability and diminishment of language in the face
of the "weight of blood" in recent history: "Words are vulnerable: /
rain, fire, the errant hand, / confusion&#8212;all can assail them. . . ."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Joubert also deplored the prevalence of fracture and obliquity as
poetic techniques in contemporary poetry: "Then there are left only
splinters of language, / fallen letters, gray tatters / like voices
far across the valley, / which echoes fracture. And sometimes nothing"
(<i>OP,</i> 49). Her epigraph

<b></b>

acknowledges Howard Fussiner because he was a close friend with whom she
had been talking about paintings for many years. Fussiner remembers that,
on one occasion they had talked about the particular formal qualities
that made this painting of de Witte's a greater work than the average
genre painting, how it surpassed the depiction of mere anecdote.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Further, in a note to the poem, Levertov distinguishes her interpretation
of the depicted scene from that of the art historian, Witold Rybscinski,
whose book <i>Home: A Short History of an Idea</i>, she had read.
<p>
In his interpretation, Rybscinski focuses on the res in the foreground
of the story de Witte depicts, the woman playing the harpsichord
and the man listening in the curtained bed near her (<a name="6"
HREF="10.3hollenberg_res.html#6"> 6</a>). Rybscinski detects a
hint of adultery beneath the surface of this idyllic domestic scene. He
notes that closer inspection reveals that the woman is not playing
for herself alone, but also for a man on the bed behind the curtains,
whose clothing is fully visible on the chair. He writes, "The hilt of a
sword that is barely within the picture and the casual fashion in which
the clothes have been flung on the chair . . . hint, in a delicate way,
that this may not be the woman's husband."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Since marital infidelity was frowned on in Holland, he sees the other
re in the painting, the maid sweeping the floor in the distance,
as part of a cautionary allegory suggesting "Cleanliness is next to
godliness."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Levertov's poem conveys a different story which she asserts is "equally
valid." She begins with the view "two rooms away,

<b></b>

seen through the open door," where she imagines that the servant girl
also listens to the music the young wife plays.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
By beginning with the view in the distance, Levertov calls attention to de
Witte's skillful use of perspective in this painting. She is also attuned
to the evocative contrasts between light and shadow in his work, to the
significance of the color red, and to the meanings of the wife's music
making. In the painting, the direct recession into depth is balanced
with forms spaced at rhythmic intervals from side to side. Zones of
space are layered and interrelated by a continuous interplay of solid
and void. This complex design is mirrored in Levertov's doubled point of
view in her poem. Although at the outset she stands outside the painting,
looking in through the doorway, to the extent that she identifies with
the servant girl, "timing the strokes of her broom to the music's crisp /
golden wavelets," she is also inside the painting, looking out. Levertov
notes the particular quality of the sunlight filtered through the windows
and the patterns of light and dark it makes on the floor:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->. . . Autumn sun
<br />
and shadows well-defined overlay the floortiles,
<br />
antiphonal transverse strips over squares
<br />
of white and black . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<div align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
[<i>ET,</i> 24].
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
She underlines the predominance of the color red, "red, / red is the
lord of color here," repeating that "a glowing Indian red" is the color
of the draperies, bedside carpet, ceiling beams, elaborate hanging lamp,
a chair, and "above all, / with its canopy, valance, ample curtains, / the
big four-poster" bed (ibid). In the context of this sequence of ekphrastic
poems I have selected, we are reminded of Soutine's "red steps," and that
this color often connotes violence and blood as well as fire and passion,
as in the sentence, "he was caught red-handed." But in this interior,
although Dutch colonies in the Americas are suggested by the phrase
"Indian red," Levertov stresses domesticity. The man's sword is cast on
the chair; he is "snug" in bed listening and not hunting and killing,
or even trading. De Witte's use of this provocative color is not the
desperate response to rejection and catastrophe we find in Soutine,
Levertov suggests, but rather a "brave resplendent red," related to
the "twang and trill" of the music, possibly a piece by Monteverdi,
"ringing out" from under the wife's fingers (ibid). In fact, with such
words as "antiphonal" and "counterpoint," words that refer both to
the compositional lines in the painting and to the musical qualities
of a harpsichord composition, Levertov turns the painting's reference
to music to her own meta-artistic purpose (ibid). Through de Witte's
"austere counterpoint of forms," the sentimental content of the painting
is purified and sublimated by its transposition into the world of music;
space and sound commingle (ibid). There are several subtexts here, she
implies, not only social ones, but possibly an aesthetic one as well. In
the shift in aesthetic thinking that marked the Romantic period to come,
art is prized less as an imitation of reality, as it was earlier when
the <i>ut pictura poesis</i> analogy held sway, than as an expression
of the human spirit.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Consequently, in place of painting, music became the art perceived to

<b></b>

have the most profound affinity with poetry during the Romantic period. By
referencing both arts in this way Levertov detaches herself from her
modernist predecessors and contemporaries who stress the impersonality
of art. Instead, she makes art an analogue of the artist it expresses,
and encourages our identification with the artist's point of view.
<p>
Levertov clarified the salutary aspects of the Dutch golden age she
perceived in this painting in a letter to Howard Fussiner and David
Eberly, defending it against their observations that de Witte's handling
of the servant girl could imply elitism and that she might be idealizing
and sentimentalizing his view of class structure. Levertov comments that
"Americans are particularly liable to a lack of historical perspective
on such an issue" since they are "brought up to identify the concept of
democracy with that of egalitarianism."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Levertov explains that Americans forget that their kind of democracy
offers "(theoretically) equal <i>opportunity</i> not <i>equality,</i>"
and that this unexamined egalitarianism "had the effect of undermining
the working-class pride which (until recently) sustained European labor
unions; a pride which wanted better conditions but didn't even dream
of changing <i>class</i>, and did not desire it" (<i>LFE</i>). She
continues: "Just as it is easy to sentimentalize a situation by
idealizing it, so it is easy to sentimentalize by placing it in a
negative light, such as assuming (by implication not in so many words)
that all labor is alienated" (ibid). She goes on to explain that,
in fact, at this time in Holland, "general prosperity" combined with
"habitable architecture" and "liberality of social atmosphere made the
lives of servants, and of women in general, much less oppressive than in
many other periods" (ibid). Most important, she points out that in her
poem, she "did not claim that that society was Utopia, in the sense of
being <i>the ideal</i>" but rather a representation of what she perceives



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
as a historical moment that was an 'apex of civilized joy,' i.e. different
from an exclusively <i>personal</i> moment of joy (such as a surge of
'animal spirits,' . . .)  in being made possible, and being <i>a part
of</i>, a historical, economic, architectural, material context. The
painting records (but not merely as anecdote!&#8212;records in the
character of its <i>composition</i>) a joyful scene involving primarily
a couple, but participated in to some extent by the maid . . . which
is at the same time (like the painting itself, so that the painting
which records is itself part of <i>what</i> it records) a manifestation
of a civilization: European civilization at a peak which has not been
surpassed and probably will not be matched. . . . Definitely not Utopia
because the merchant riches of that society derived in part from trades
abroad involving oppressed workers in oppressive societies&#8212;including
slavery. But <i>domestically,</i> relatively exemplary.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="right">

<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
That Levertov was interested in the linkage between issues of power and
social governance and issues of form not only in Holland in 1660 but in
contemporary America is clear when we consider that <i>Evening Train</i>
also includes a section of poems titled "Witnessing From Afar," many of
which respond explicitly to America's involvement in the Gulf War. The
achievement of "peaceful joy" shown in this painting reflects a dream of
social justice partially realized in the Dutch golden age, but always and
everywhere a desideratum. Levertov's comment in her letter to Fussiner
and Eberly that

<b></b>

this joyful scene is recorded not only in the content of the painting
but in "the character of its composition," reminds us that she employs
ekphrasis in the service of a similar dream (ibid). The awareness of
difference inherent in this genre, particularly the desire to connect
with an "other," informs her poem's theme and structure. It is obvious in
the overt connections Levertov makes across class boundaries, between
the servant girl and the young wife, and across gender boundaries,
between the happily married man and woman, both of which are in the
"human scene" she depicts in the first stanza. These are expressed in
a verse paragraph that is flowing, conversational, and also reflective,
wherein the speaker addresses herself as well the audience.
<p>
The desire for connection is also evident in the second verse paragraph,
shorter and more urgent, in which the speaker addresses her audience
more directly:



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
<span style="margin-left: 10em; margin-bottom:0;">But if
<br /></span>
the same scene had been painted differently&#8212;
<br />
not only with other colors, but from another
<br />
distance, perspectives differently disposed, more curves,
<br />
less play of severe rectangles if it had been
<br />
a composition that lacked this austere
<br />
counterpoint of forms which evoke,
<br />
in brave resplendent red, the very
<br />
twang and trill and wiry
<br />
ground bass of the notes ringing forth
<br />
under her fingers&#8212;if it had been
<br />
reduced to anecdote&#8212;we'd never have known
<br />
that once, in eternity,
<br />
this peaceful joy had blessed an autumnal morning.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<div align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
[<i>ET,</i> 24, 25]
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Levertov supposes a comparison between de Witte's painting and other
depictions of the same subject, which if "painted differently&#8212;not
only with other colors but from another / distance, perspectives
differently disposed," would be less powerful. The phrase "another
distance" (heightened by the line break) suggests not only other genre
paintings of de Witte's period but of other historical periods as well,
including our own. It also reaches toward a timeless realm of no past
or future which is associated with divinity. Levertov's aim here is
connection with the eternal, or at least with de Witte's ability, through
his painting, to preserve forever the aura of this glowing, domestic
interior. She employs the "still moment," a literary topos in which
poetry imitates the visual arts by "stopping time, or more precisely
by referring to an action through a still moment that implies it"
(<i>CR,</i> 40). The realization of her goal is, of course, impossible,
given the ephemeral quality of human life and the fundamental temporality
of poetry as structures of sounds in time.
<p>
The distinction between temporal and spatial modes, aural and visual
media, are familiar oppositions of semiotics. W. J. T. Mitchell has
pointed out that they put a special pressure upon the ekphrastic
encounter. Since the visual work can never really be made present by
the poem, it must be "conjured up as a potent absence or a fictive,

<b></b>

ral" presence (<i>PT,</i> 158). In fact, the evocation of just such
a potent absence or ral presence is central to Levertov's thematic
purposes here. Her emphasis on the act of composition itself, in which
matter is trans-substantiated by artistic form, is important to her,
especially during this period in her life, because it is analogous to and
derivative from the Christian belief in the "real presence" of incarnate
divinity in the Eucharist.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Earlier she had based her ideas about "organic form" on "an intuition
of an order, a form beyond forms, in which forms partake, and of which
man's creative works are analogies, resemblances, natural allegories"
(<i>NSE,</i> 68). Although she had drawn on Gerard Manley Hopkins's
concepts of "inscape" and "instress" to formulate this concept, she
had couched this Roman Catholic poet's sacramental view of the world
in Platonic language. However, by the time these ekphrastic poems were
written she was a practicing Catholic, and though still frequently
wracked by doubt, she had written other poems, inspired by passages of
the Gospel or the lives of saints, that she described as examples of
"do-it-yourself-theology" (<i>NSE,</i> 249). Perhaps most important, she
had, through this poetry, "worked through to a theological explanation"
of the theodicy problem&#8212;God's nonintervention in "the global
panorama of oppression and violence"&#8212;by newly experiencing the
implications of human choice. As she put it, "God's nature, as Love,
demands a freely given requital from that part of the creation which
particularly embodies Consciousness: the Human" (<i>NSE,</i> 251). The
"imagination of faith" acted as "yeast" in her life as a writer, and
composing poems became "work that enfaiths" (<i>NSE,</i> 257,255).
<p>
Levertov's awareness of the difference between de Witte's surpassing
vision in this painting and that of more mundane genre painters in
his time, as well as her knowledge of the gap between his social
context and our own, infuses "The Composition" with existential and
religious pathos. She repeats the word "if" three times, stressing the
conditional nature of his achievement (<i>ET,</i> 24, 25). The phrase
"reduced to anecdote" may refer not only to the stories told in other
genre paintings but to our contemporary tendency to dismiss religious
beliefs as mere myths or stories. Also, her words, "once, in eternity,"
introduce an important note of irony. The historical understanding that
coexists with the insistent otherworldliness of Levertov's desire here
only makes the desire more powerful as a form of postmodern witness. The
"still moment" achieved through this poem's expression of ekphrastic
hope has a radiance that is enhanced by the tragic knowledge behind
it, which Levertov calls our attention to in her phrase, "we'd never
have known." This is a knowledge amply attested to by the other poems I
discussed as well. Whether immersed in the tragedies of twentieth-century
history, like Kiefer and Soutine, or expressive of transformation, like
Duvet and Chillida, all of these poems, like the works of art which
inspire them, resist political domination in forms that are clearly
accessible to her audience. Although Levertov has grown increasingly
conscious of the darker levels to which human beings can descend and
to the vulnerability of language, she continues to draw from a deep
well of religious and humanist value. Her poetry remains answerable to
"what should be" as well as to "things as they are," as Seamus Heaney
put it recently, arguing eloquently for the power of poetry, even at
its most desolate, to "strengthen the individual's moral sense," as well

<b></b>

as his "feeling of personal dignity" and "trust in human solidarity."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Thus, she provides an ethical and political model for her reader. In
these ekphrastic poems, in the company of visual artists whose vision
she shares, Levertov maintains faith in human possibility. As she wrote
of her early experience of paintings in a museum, in a poem which
foreshadows her creation of comparable verbal structures: "Here was
history / / as I desired it" (<i>CIB,</i> 48).

Mitchell identifies three characteristic phases of realization
accompanying ekphrasis. The first he calls "ekphrastic indifference,"
which grows out of a commonsense perception that ekphrasis is impossible;
the second is "ekphrastic hope," in which this impossibility is overcome
in imagination or metaphor; the third is "ekphrastic fear," when we
sense that "the difference between verbal and visual representation
might collapse and the rative, imaginary desire of ekphrasis might
be realized literally and actually" (<i>PT,</i> 152-4).
